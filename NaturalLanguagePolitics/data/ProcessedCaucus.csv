They want policy change.” “…policies that see them, center them, and serve them, and they would prefer that over bouquets, verbal or otherwise.” Video (YouTube) BOSTON – Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) marked Mother’s Day with a powerful speech on the House floor in which she called for meaningful policy change to better support mothers and caregivers, including maternal health justice, affordable childcare, universal paid leave, reproductive freedom, home and community-based services, and more. Footage from the speech can be found here and a transcript is below. Transcript: In Powerful Mother’s Day Speech, Ayanna Pressley Calls for Policy Change to Support Mothers & Caregivers  March 8, 2024 U.S House of Representatives This time of year, Mr. Speaker, we wax poetic about the contributions of mothers. We call their work valued, their love endless, their role invaluable.  Mr. Speaker, mothers across America don’t want a Hallmark card. They want policy change.  I grew up in a small storefront church on the southside of Chicago and my grandfather was the pastor there. And even as a pastor, he would often say that he would rather see a sermon than hear one.  Mr. Speaker, the mothers of this country are deserving of policies. Policies that see them, center them, and serve them, and they would prefer that over bouquets, verbal or otherwise.  We tell mothers that caregiving is their greatest contribution, and then undermine them at every turn.  We tell women that motherhood is aspirational and the greatest contribution they will ever make, while for many a safe pregnancy is a privilege and not a right.  Then we thrust them into a broken healthcare system that denies their bodily autonomy, criminalizes pregnancy outcomes, and jeopardizes their lives.  We tell mothers that the work of keeping that baby warm, safe and fed is the highest calling, and then we allow negligence and policy gaps to create a baby formula shortage in the midst of a pandemic as mothers panic to meet a most basic need.  We tell mothers that they must work like they don’t have children and parent like they don’t work, while we fail to pass a universal paid leave policy thrusting mamas and caregivers back into the workplace and mere weeks after their babies are born.  We tell mothers that it takes a village and we’re so proud to be a part of theirs, and then we fail to invest in safe, affordable childcare.  We tell mothers that they are their children’s first teachers, and they send their little ones out into the world with a hopeful heart, and then a stark reality keeps them up at night — that policy gaps will fail to keep that child safe from a gun on the block or in the classroom.  We tell mothers that in the twilight of their lives after they’ve poured into their babies that we will take care of them, and then we gut social programs that would help our elders age in community with dignity and the care that they need.  Mr. Speaker, mothers don’t need empty praise. They need policy change.  Now by the grace of God and the sheer will and brilliance and sacrifice of my mother, my shero, Sandy Pressley, may she rest in peace and power, the woman who gave me my roots and my wings.  There are many lessons that I was afforded by her example. Chief amongst them that being a mother was, in her opinion, her greatest achievement and her superpower. But it was also not her only identity.  And because I had a front row seat early on to her humanity, I saw the many struggles and hardships that she was confronted with on a daily basis.  Not for a lack of good character. Not for a lack of strong work ethic. But because of an absence of policy or of policy violence. Mr. Speaker, as a nation we penalize and marginalize the very people who give us life. But yet and still, mothers and caregivers persist — persist in doing the work of community and movement building, of mothering, of nurturing, when it’s been 101 years too long, and we have yet to even enshrine gender equality in our constitution.  We still have not passed the Equal Rights Amendment, and still we raise our voices and we rise in the halls of power navigating systems not built for us to speak out.  Together we press day in and day out for a more just America. Because being a mom, being a mama, being a mommy, is our superpower.  But this is not a just nation which supports us as parents, as caregivers.  We want this to be a just nation and one that is more just and fair for the generations we are raising, and for the generations to come.  We fight for the rights of our children and grandchildren. We move with the clarity and conviction that only caretakers can.  Leaving a better world behind is not an abstract concept. It is grounded in the children right in front of us.  Every society owes a debt of gratitude to those who mother and in their name we press for a world that lives up to their aspirations.  A world that keeps their babies safe. A world that keeps all our babies safe.  Mr. Speaker, I would rather see a sermon than hear one.  Thank you. I yield. ### Washington DC Office 402 Cannon HOB

1,May 10,Morgan Griffith,R,Va.-9,Congressman Griffiths Weekly E-Newsletter 5.10.24,"It has been roughly four and a half years since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and I am determined that Congress needs to be fully informed on U.S. government funding of risky research projects, such as the research done at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), in order to make sure the same mistakes don’t happen again. During the 118th Congress, I’ve signed letters pressing the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for information and documents pertaining to risky research projects and biosecurity practices past and present, which would obviously include data concerning the origins of COVID-19. As Chair of the Energy & Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight & Investigations, I held a hearing in 2023 to review biosafety and risk research. Also, I have participated in closed-door transcribed interviews with Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Dr. Francis Collins of NIH and EcoHealth Alliance President, Dr. Peter Daszak. Daszak was a leading collaborative figure in applying for NIH grants, and was responsible for providing progress reports on EcoHealth’s research. EcoHealth is the company that received grants from NIAID which in turn gave subgrants to WIV to conduct research on Coronavirus evolution and transmission.  At a November 2023 deposition, I asked Daszak about EcoHealth’s very late year-five progress report due to be filed in September of 2019. He said he “tried” to submit the progress report on time but could not get the NIH system to work.  Recall that evidence indicates the virus broke out in November or December of 2019 in China.  The missing report would not be submitted until August of 2021. During Daszak’s November interview, after I asked him specific questions about the report and if there were any changes, he told me first there was no change, then no “significant” change between the September 2019 version he tried to submit and the August 2021 submission. After the transcribed interview, a whistleblower gave us a draft of the progress report, dated May of 2020, where EcoHealth stated that bat coronavirus spillover was a rare event in South China and Southeast Asia. However, in their August 2021 official submission of the year-five progress report, despite supposedly using the exact same data as the initial draft, EcoHealth stated that the viral transference of coronaviruses from bats to humans could affect as many as one million people in South China and Southeast Asia. To me the difference between ‘very rare’ and a ‘million’ people is a significant difference. But during the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic hearing on May 1, I asked Daszak why the change between May 2020 and August 2021. Did he have conversations with Fauci or his colleagues at NIAID? Was he pressured by outside sources? Or did they make the changes to hide potential EcoHealth liability? He claimed the science changed! But that’s not what he told me in November of 2023. And I gave him several chances. Daszak clearly did not tell the truth. He lied to me and Congress in November! There must be some reason why. A report from the Select Subcommittee recommends formal debarment of and a criminal investigation into EcoHealth and Daszak.  Unfortunately, I believe this is unlikely to happen under a Biden Department of Justice. We should let a jury of American people decide if there is a substantial difference between a ‘very rare’ occurrence and as many as one ‘million’ people coming down with a virus. But the guy who Fauci and NIAID entrusted with our taxpayer dollars claims there is no substantial difference. Further, EcoHealth did not obtain required logbooks from WIV. We will never be able to eliminate all doubt there was a lab leak at WIV because Wuhan didn’t submit crucial data to EcoHealth as required. Moreover, EcoHealth didn’t insist Wuhan provide them with the data as contractually required. And can we even trust the data we actually got?  It comes down to whether you believe ‘very rare’ or a ‘million’ cases a year are substantially the same. I don’t. I do not trust information from WIV or EcoHealth. Additionally, I find it incomprehensible that NIAID continues to fund EcoHealth research. Not to alarm you, but the government is telling us right now that bird flu transference to humans is very rare.  Sound familiar? And is NIAID doing risky research on other viruses like the animal poxes? And if so, who are they collaborating with? I will continue to dig into the facts and try to make government research projects safer.

2,May 10,Nanette Barragán,D,Calif.-44,Affordable housing crisis looms large in election,"The Hill | Taylor Giorno  May 1, 2024  “Congress can, and should, do its part to create more flexibility and invest more in federal programs such as the Housing Choice Voucher, HOME, and Homelessness Assistance Grants Program, provide strong tenants protections, and reform federal regulations that hamper our local partners’ ability to increase our affordable housing supply,” [Congresswoman Nanette] Barragán said. As President Biden courts young voters and bucks negative perceptions of his handling of the economy, one economic issue looms large over the upcoming election: a historic lack of affordable housing. The cost of buying a house just hit an all-time high, and even though rental prices are down slightly from their peak in 2022, Americans in red and blue districts alike are feeling the crunch.  A White House report released in March found that although incomes have doubled since 2000, housing prices have tripled, meaning the housing prices rose 50 percent faster than income over the past two decades. The median home price recently hit $383,725, a record high that’s up 5.2 percent from a year ago, according to the real estate company Redfin. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has ticked back up above 7 percent as a recent run of strong inflation and economic data delays the timeline for the Federal Reserve to cut borrowing costs. The U.S. is also short nearly 4 million homes, according to a recent study by Up For Growth commissioned by the American Planning Association. Casey Dawkins, professor of urban studies and planning at the University of Maryland, identified two culprits of high housing prices that date back several presidential administrations. “New housing production fell dramatically during the foreclosure crisis of 2007-2010 and has not since recovered. Several factors account for this, including rising construction costs due to supply-chain disruptions and local land use regulations that increase the time, cost, and uncertainty associated with obtaining a development permit,” Dawkins wrote. “With rising income inequality, there are more people today earning incomes below what is necessary to afford an adequate home.” In this housing market, it’s no surprise that the lack of affordable housing is weighing on the minds of voters. Just more than 53 percent of homeowners and renters say housing affordability will impact who they vote for in the upcoming presidential election, according to a report by Redfin released in March. “I think that just goes to show that [housing affordability] is weighing on people’s perception of who they want to vote for,” Daryl Fairweather, Redfin’s chief economist, told The Hill. Biden is battling negative perceptions on his handling of the economy as he gears up for a rematch against former President Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee. Just 34 percent of voters approve of how Biden has handled the economy while 29 percent approve of how he has handled inflation, according to a recent CNN poll, which also found Trump has a 6-point lead over the incumbent. Shelter costs are a key sticking point for persistent inflation, which was up 3.5 percent in March from a year ago, according to the most recent data released by the Labor Department. Shelter costs, which were up 5.7 percent from a year ago, accounted for 60 percent of the total annual increase and were “the largest factor in the monthly increase in the index for all items less food and energy.” High interest rates, which the Federal Reserve hiked to a 22-year high last summer, have also pushed up borrowing costs. The central bank is not expected to cut rates Wednesday and has signaled it is delaying its timeline to cut rates, meaning the cost of buying a house will likely remain elevated longer than initially expected. The president dedicated precious time during this year’s State of the Union address to tout his administration’s efforts to make housing more affordable, “reflective of the fact that they recognize there’s growing public angst about affordability and Washington is still struggling with what to do about it,” said Jeb Mason, a partner at Mindset and a former Treasury Department official during former President George W. Bush’s administration. Biden’s budget proposal for next year, which was dead on arrival in the Republican-controlled House, included several provisions aimed at bringing down housing costs such as expanding the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, creating a New Neighborhood Homes Tax Credit, and grants to incentivize states, local governments and tribes to build more homes.  The president also asked Congress to pass provisions directly targeting first-time homebuyers, including a Mortgage Relief Credit and funding for a down payment assistance program. Congress is considering a number of measures to alleviate high housing prices that are weighing on their districts. While some lawmakers have taken partisan swipes across the aisle during recent hearings on housing affordability, there are several bipartisan proposals this Congress. Such measures include Sens. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) and Mike Rounds’s (R-S.D.) Rural Housing Service Reform Act; Reps. Darin LaHood (R-Ill.) and Suzan DelBene’s (D-Wash.) and Sens. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) and Todd Young’s (R-Ind.) Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act; and Reps. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.) and Brian Higgins’s (D-N.Y.) and Sens. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and Young’s Neighborhood Homes Investment Act. Mason, who advises companies, policymakers and other stakeholders on housing and financial regulation issues, said “there is a bipartisan appetite to do something, I think the question is just what can realistically get done in an election year before people kind of get into full campaign mode.” Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-Calif.), who chairs the Congressional Renters Caucus, told The Hill he hears “often from people who are frustrated.” Gomez represents part of Los Angeles, which Redfin found to have the highest median housing price and the HUD report found to have the second-highest homeless population after New York City.  “Homeownership is core to the American Dream, but it’s out of reach for so many Americans who are forced to rent instead,” said Gomez, who is working to significantly increase federal funding for rental assistance in the new government spending package. “Maintaining current federal levels is entirely inadequate and fails to meet the scope of the current housing crisis,” he said. Gomez also recently proposed new monthly tax credits specifically for middle-class renters “to help close the gap between income and rent, with tax credits that put money directly into the pockets of working people.” But Fairweather said that “a lot of the stuff that seems comprehensive like homebuyer credits, down payment assistance, those kinds of things, don’t solve the problem either.” “Really we have to solve supply problems,” she said. Angela Brooks, president of the American Planning Association, the membership organization for planning professionals such as urban planners, told The Hill that increasing the housing supply “is a national challenge, and it demands a national response.” “In many cases, localities are hamstrung by the local opponents afraid of change. And while housing action is a priority across many states, they’re not moving fast enough in the way we need to alleviate supply challenges. That’s where federal partners can play a big role. Housing supply and zoning reform is one of the few issues in Congress gaining bipartisan traction right now,” Brooks said. Rep. Nanette Diaz Barragán (D-Calif.), who co-chairs the Congressional Caucus on Homelessness and also represents parts of Los Angeles, told The Hill that “congressional action is needed to deliver the critical investments and protections to our communities that will provide more affordable housing and keep families housed.” State and local governments have been struggling to manage the increasing number of homeless individuals in their communities. More than 653,000 people were experiencing homelessness last year, an all-time high as a result of rising housing prices and the end of pandemic-era assistance, according to a report released in December by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). “Congress can, and should, do its part to create more flexibility and invest more in federal programs such as the Housing Choice Voucher, HOME, and Homelessness Assistance Grants Program, provide strong tenants protections, and reform federal regulations that hamper our local partners’ ability to increase our affordable housing supply,” Barragán said. But some cities and states have turned to more punitive measures, including fines and arrest, and the Supreme Court last week heard a controversial case that could strengthen their authority to enforce anti-vagrancy and anti-encampment laws. Dawkins was doubtful that cracking down on the homeless population will solve the nation’s housing crisis. “Penalizing unhoused people for sleeping in public spaces will do nothing to alleviate the national homelessness problem; it will only change the geography of the problem by forcing those without shelter to relocate to other communities,” Dawkins said. “To get more people into homes, we need to build more housing.” Stay up-to-date on District 44's latest news, updates and more!

5,May 9,Ayanna Pressley,D,Mass.-7,"Ahead of Mothers Day, Pressley, Moore, Underwood, Adams, Dingell, Warren, Booker, Casey Re-Introduce Mamas First Act","May 9, 2024 WASHINGTON – Today ahead of Mother’s Day, Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07), alongside Representatives Gwen Moore (W-04I), Lauren Underwood (IL-14), Alma Adams (NC-12) and Debbie Dingell (MI-06), and Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Bob Casey (D-PA) announced the re-introduction of the Mamas First Act, legislation that directly and meaningfully addresses the maternal mortality crisis by expanding Medicaid to include doula and midwifery care.  “Maternal health justice is racial justice. While we work to confront the Black maternal morbidity crisis in America, the Mamas First Actwould save lives by ensuring pregnancy-related care includes expansive and comprehensive health care coverage for doulas and midwifery services – including prenatal, delivery, and postpartum services,” said Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, co-founder of the Black Maternal Health Caucus. “Comprehensive, culturally-congruent care should be a reality for all, not just some, and I am proud to reintroduce this vital legislation alongside Rep. Moore and my colleagues. Congress must pass this bill without delay.” “America’s ongoing maternal health crisis magnifies the need for federal interventions that can save lives. The Mamas First Act is an important effort because it will expand access to providers who can offer emotional and physical support during and after the birthing process – comprehensive beyond the hospital setting where nearly all U.S. births occur. Our legislation is an opportunity to empower more mothers with doulas and midwives – perinatal professionals who advocate for a mother’s needs. I am thrilled to join my amazing House and Senate maternal health champions in re-introducing this vital legislation,” saidCongresswoman Gwen Moore. “As we’re seeing today at the state level in North Carolina, Medicaid expansion continues to improve outcomes for mothers, babies, and all Americans,” said Congresswoman Alma S. Adams, Ph.D., co-founder and co-chair of the Black Maternal Health Caucus. “That’s why I’m proud to support the reintroduction of Congresswoman Moore’s Mamas First Act. Maternal mortality remains significantly higher in the United States than in other comparable countries, especially for Black mothers. This legislation addresses the maternal mortality crisis by expanding Medicaid to include doula and midwifery care, because having trusted partners in the birthing process saves lives. Mothers are less than half of the population, but we give birth to 100% of it – Congress needs to put Mamas First because our Mamas can’t wait.” “Good care and support from a doula or midwife can make the difference between a positive and healthy pregnancy outcome, and a devastating one. Every mom should be able to access this critically important care,” said Congresswoman Lauren Underwood, co-founder and co-chair of the Black Maternal Health Caucus.. “As Co-Founder and Co-Chair of the Black Maternal Health Caucus, I’m proud to join Congresswoman Gwen Moore to introduce the Mamas First Act, a bold step to address our country’s maternal mortality crisis by expanding Medicaid coverage to include doula and midwife care. Together, we can, and must, take decisive action to save lives and end disparities.” “The quality of care a pregnant woman receives should not depend on the color of her skin, where she lives, or her ability to pay. Each childbirth is different, and women and their doctors should be empowered to decide what care is best. By providing access to adequate and proper maternal services, including doulas and midwives, we will help end the maternal mortality crisis in our country and ensure our children start their lives out healthy and strong,” said Congresswoman Debbie Dingell. “The United States has a terrible track record when it comes to maternal mortality, and it’s costing women their lives,” said Senator Elizabeth Warren. “Now is the time to use all available tools to combat the maternal health crisis, including by expanding Medicaid to cover access to doulas, midwives, and tribal midwives. The Mama’s First Act will take care of our mommas and babies and will help us root out the deep disparities and systemic racism in our health care system.” “Expanding Medicaid to include doula and midwifery care is imperative to combating the maternal mortality crisis disproportionately impacting Black and indigenous mothers,” said Senator Cory Booker. “Doula-assisted mothers are less likely to experience complications at birth, and midwife-led care is associated with healthier outcomes for mothers and their babies. All mothers deserve support and care throughout their pregnancy and postpartum journeys, and this legislation is a critical step toward ensuring more equitable access to quality maternal health care.” “Every mother deserves support and care before, during, and after birth,” said Senator Bob Casey. “This legislation will help address the maternal health crisis in this country by ensuring that Medicaid covers the full spectrum of care that mothers and infants need.” America is facing a maternal mortality crisis, with the highest maternal mortality rate among wealthy nations.  According to a study conducted by the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), maternal mortality rates have doubled between the years of 1999 and 2019 while decreasing in other similar wealthy nations.  Black and Native mothers have maternal mortality rates that are two to three times the rate of white mothers. There is also a lack of access to maternity health care providers in communities across the country, also called maternity care deserts, impacting nearly 7 million women and nearly 500,000 births nationwide, according to the March of Dimes. The Mamas First Act amends the Social Security Actto allow doulas, midwives, and tribal midwives to be reimbursed by Medicaid. The Mamas First Act is endorsed by: Black Mamas Matter Alliance (BMMA), March of Dimes, The Association of Maternal & Child Health Programs (AMCHP), National Birth Equity Collaborative, Common Sense Childbirth Inc., American College of Nurse Midwives (ACNM), Centers for Reproductive Rights, What to Expect Project, Futures Without Violence, Seattle Indian Health Board, African American Breastfeeding Network, Momsrising, and Ujima. “The African American Breastfeeding Network supports and fully endorses the Mammas First Act because it is essential that Wisconsin provides Medicaid reimbursement coverage so that doulas and birth workers can earn equitable pay without having to work multiple jobs,” said Dalvery Blackwell, Executive Director, Co-Founder of the African American Breastfeeding Network. “Every mom deserves the respectful, responsive, nurturing and empowering care she needs to deliver a healthy beginning and a healthy future to herself and the baby she loves. Research shows that midwives and doulas deliver that care best – along with lower rates of complications, c-sections and epidurals, perinatal mood and anxiety disorders and birth trauma, higher rates of breastfeeding success…and lower healthcare costs. The Mamas First Act delivers that care where it’s needed most to the moms who need it most, by ensuring Medicaid coverage of doulas, midwives and tribal midwives. That’s why the What to Expect Project and I are proud to endorse this critical bill,” saidHeidi Murkoff, author of What to Expect When You’re Expecting and founder of the What to Expect Project. “Across the country, African American, American Indian, and Alaskan Native mothers are dying at rates three to four times that of white mothers. In addition, we are seeing expanding maternity care deserts in cities and rural areas across the U.S. where seven million women live, and nearly 150,000 babies are being born, who have no or limited access to maternity care. Expanding access to care, by increasing access to doulas and midwives, is a key component to reversing these alarming trends. With 42% of pregnant women utilizing Medicaid for coverage, the Mamas First Act would take a major step in the right direction in getting pregnant women the access to care they need and ensure that their infants have the best start to life possible,” saidStacey Y. Brayboy, Sr. Vice President, Public Policy & Government Affairs. “As a Mama, OB/Gyn and the Founder and President of the National Birth Equity Collaborative, I am so excited about the opportunity we have to improve birth outcomes for all by passing the Mamas First Act in 2024. As we look for solutions to ensure Black Mamas, babies and their villages thrive, Doula support must be covered by all State Medicaid Plans,” said Joia Crear Perry, MD, Founder & President of the National Birth Equity Collaborative.  “BMMA applauds the continued efforts of Representative Gwen Moore and all the co-sponsors of the Mamas First Act as it will allow for Midwifery and Doula services to be reimbursable through Medicaid. Many states, especially in the southern region of the U.S., are in significant need of high-quality, holistic, and comprehensive maternity care. Passage of the Mamas First Act can help strengthen maternity care workforce efforts,” said Angela D. Aina, Executive Director, Black Mamas Matter Alliance, Inc (BMMA). “Ujima celebrates Congresswoman Moore’s reintroduction of the Mama First Act and her continued fight to ensure equitable and comprehensive maternal health options for all. Doulas and Midwives not only provide expansive perinatal care, but also have proven to be a valuable asset to combat maternal mortality and morbidity. Medicaid coverage for these services removes barriers for parents, particularly the 65% of Black birthing people who rely on Medicaid for pregnancy and postpartum assistance. The Mama First Act demonstrates actionable steps toward disparate  maternal care. Ujima applauds Representative Moore, Senator Elizabeth Warren and all the co-sponsors for their commitment to holistic maternal care for women,” said Karma Cottman, CEO, Ujima, The National Center on Violence Against Women in the Black Community.  As a founding member of the Black Maternal Health Caucus, Congresswoman Pressley has been a longtime champion of maternal health and reproductive justice. ### Washington DC Office 402 Cannon HOB

6,May 9,Nanette Barragán,D,Calif.-44,Democrats urge Biden to act on immigration as Trump threatens deportations,"More than 80 lawmakers sent Biden some concrete ideas as his administration considers executive actions to address U.S. border crossings. NBC News | Julie Tsirkin May 8th, 2024  WASHINGTON — Immigration advocates and Democratic lawmakers are urging President Joe Biden to prioritize long-term undocumented immigrants as his administration weighs executive actions to curb record crossings along the southern border. In a letter signed by more than 80 lawmakers, including members of the Congressional Hispanic and Progressive caucuses, the Democrats ask Biden to “take all available actions to streamline pathways to lawful status for undocumented immigrants” ahead of the November election. “Deporting all such individuals — as former President Donald Trump has threatened to do if reelected — would devastate the American economy and destroy American families,” they added. The letter offers concrete steps they say the White House could take, including streamlining the process by which DACA recipients, or immigrants brought to the country illegally as children, can seek to change to a nonimmigrant status. Lawmakers also ask Biden to unify families by allowing undocumented migrants married to U.S. citizens to seek parole on a case-by-case basis and reduce processing times for green card cases so that those migrants could be eligible to work. The chair of the Hispanic Caucus, Rep. Nanette Barragan, D-Calif., said in a statement that Biden “should seize this critical moment by exercising his Executive Authority to rebuild our broken immigration system.” “We urge him to provide pathways to citizenship and protections for the millions of long-term undocumented residents who have contributed to the rich fabric of the United States,” she said. The new push follows a letter in March from Senate Democrats, led by Judiciary Committee Chair Dick Durbin, of Illinois, and Immigration Subcommittee Chair Alex Padilla, of California, outlining the same call to action. ”As the Biden administration considers executive actions on immigration, we must not return to failed Trump-era policies aimed at banning asylum and moving us backwards,” Padilla told NBC News in a statement. On Monday, NBC News reported that Biden is considering using his executive authority in the coming weeks to potentially restrict the number of migrants who can enter the U.S.  The administration has been in touch with immigration advocacy groups ahead of any executive order. A Department of Homeland Security official with knowledge of the discussions said the White House would most likely invoke power reserved for the president in Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows a president discretion over who is admitted into the U.S. Under that authority, Customs and Border Protection would be directed to block the entry of migrants crossing over from Mexico if daily border crossings passed a certain threshold. It’s similar to a provision of the border bill negotiated by a bipartisan group of senators earlier this year, which was killed by Republicans, in part, at Trump’s urging. Advocates are worried that the policy would be too restrictive on asylum, as are some Democrats who opposed the bill in February and called for a legal pathway to citizenship for undocumented people in the U.S. to be included in the text. Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus lobbied the administration over months to no avail, with Democratic leadership eventually giving up its long-held red line on immigration reform to unlock aid to Ukraine amid a Republican blockade. The GOP rejected the bipartisan compromise regardless, effectively sinking all near-term prospects for Congress to tackle an issue that has plagued the U.S. government for years. Nonetheless, Padilla said this is Biden’s “opportunity” to “provide relief for the long-term immigrants of this nation.” Padilla is leading a news conference Wednesday afternoon with lawmakers and advocates from FWD.us, American Families United, UnidosUS and CASA to spotlight the letter to Biden. The president of FWD.us, an immigration advocacy group, said in a statement that most Americans “don’t have the opportunity to improve the lives of hundreds of thousands of American families — but President Biden does.” ”He has the legal authority to provide affirmative relief to the spouses of U.S. citizens, and other longtime undocumented community members,” Todd Schulte said. “We hope, and believe, he will act soon to protect these American families.” Stay up-to-date on District 44's latest news, updates and more!

7,May 9,Pramila Jayapal,D,Wash.-7,Jayapal Statement Commending Biden for Statements in Support of Withholding Weapons from Israel,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Representative Pramila Jayapal (WA-07) released the following statement in response to President Biden’s interview on the state of conflict in the Middle East: “I commend President Biden for publicly stating that the U.S. will not supply Israel with weapons if they launch a full-scale invasion of Rafah that hits the population centers. This is a significant and unprecedented shift of policy that I, many Members of Congress and hundreds of thousands of people here in the U.S. and across the world have been calling for. “Just last week, I and Rep. Madeleine Dean led a letter with 55 of our House colleagues calling on the President to make exactly this shift in policy to withhold certain offensive military aid to the Israeli government, including aid sourced from legislation already signed into law, in order to preempt a full-scale assault on Rafah.’ Our letter made clear, as did the President tonight, that the United States would continue to provide defensive military assistance that helps protect Israeli citizens from attacks by Hezbollah or Iran, such as the Iron Dome.   “I commend the President for heeding this call to ensure we protect innocent Palestinian lives and refuse to supply weapons to ensure no more civilians in Gaza are killed as a consequence of U.S. bombs. This is an important turning point in this war and, as the President himself said, he has heard the protestors across this country.  Now we must achieve a ceasefire to protect innocent civilians, return all the hostages, and build a path towards security for both Israelis and Palestinians to live with peace and security.”

It shows a clear lack of understanding of the situation on the ground and the threat Hamas poses to Israel.

Hamas has substantial military assets, troops and munitions, inside Rafah that Israel for self-defense reasons must neutralize.

9,May 8,Ayanna Pressley,D,Mass.-7,"Pressley, Haiti Caucus, Colleagues, Advocates Renew Calls for Federal Action to Stabilize Haiti, Address Growing Crisis on the Island","May 8, 2024 Lawmakers Continue Calls for Extending TPS for Haiti, Halting Deportations, Disrupting Arms Trafficking, Providing Humanitarian & Economic Assistance, and More Press Conference (Twitter) | Photos (Dropbox) WASHINGTON – Haiti Caucus Co-Chairs Congresswomen Ayanna Pressley (MA-07), Yvette D. Clarke (NY-09) and Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick (FL-20), along with Congresswoman Cori Bush (MO-01), Congresswoman Frederica Wilson (FL-24), and Congresswoman Barbara Lee (CA-13), held a Capitol Hill press conference with colleagues and advocates to renew their calls for urgent federal action to address the growing crisis in Haiti. The press conference comes at a time when the humanitarian, political, economic, and security crises in Haiti are becoming increasingly dire.  The policies called for by the lawmakers and advocates include: extending and redesignating TPS for Haiti; halting all deportations to Haiti; disrupting arms trafficking to the island; providing urgent humanitarian relief; preventing the transfer of Haitian nationals to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; passing a new economic assistance package that creates jobs and rebuilds Haiti’s infrastructure; facilitating the establishment of a representative transitional government led by Haitian civil society; and more. “Our Haitian siblings on the island and throughout the diaspora should know that we have not forgotten them and we will never stop fighting for the just and equitable future the Haitian people need and deserve,” said Congresswoman Pressley, Co-Chair of the House Haiti Caucus. “Congress and the Biden Administration have a moral obligation to take action to stabilize Haiti and to save lives, including by providing humanitarian and economic assistance, extending TPS for Haiti, halting deportations, supporting a democratic transition led by Haitian civil society, and more. If we truly believe Black lives matter, then that must include Haitian lives.” “Our nation owes a debt to Haiti. Repayment begins by helping ensure that a Haitian-led democracy rings true in their communities, in the United States, and across the globe. We must take every action necessary to secure a democratic transition led by Haiti’s civil society, and that includes providing vital humanitarian and economic aid, expediting visa processing, cracking down on illegal arms trafficking, and extending TPS and halting deportations. Congress has a responsibility to support Haitian stability and the safety of all its people, and it holds the power to deliver the progress our Haitian neighbors at home and abroad are counting on. In this dire moment where the future of our beloved Caribbean ally is at risk and millions of lives remain imperiled, inaction is inexcusable,” said Congresswoman Yvette D. Clarke, Co-Chair of the House Haiti Caucus. “In the face of the crisis in Haiti, our moral compass and international duty compel us to step forward, not just to alleviate the immediate suffering of the Haitian people, but to address the systemic problems forcing Haitians to flee their homeland. The extension and re-designation of Temporary Protected Status (TPS), alongside an expedited parole program and an immediate halt to deportations, are critical first steps. But our responsibility does not end there. We must confront the root causes of migration by: (1) ensuring that Haitians can live safely and peacefully within their own borders; (2) taking a firm stand against the trafficking of firearms from places like Florida to Haiti; (3) holding those who perpetuate violence and instability accountable,” said Congresswoman Sheila Cherfilus McCormick, Co-Chair of the House Haiti Caucus. “As a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I have a pulse on the challenges facing our allies around the world. Just as we have extended our support to them during their time of need, Haiti deserves the same treatment. The time for action is now – to protect lives, foster security, and promote stability where Haitians can thrive in their own country.” “To deport people back to Haiti is a cause and kiss of death,” said Congresswoman Frederica Wilson. “There is nothing in Haiti but suffering, so we have to say to the President of the United States, ‘Stop the deportation.’ Not only expand TPS but stop the deportation and support the new government that we are putting together in Haiti. This government is being supported by the international community, the United States government, and the Caribbean community; it is Haitian-led. We must fund them—fund them just as we do other countries. Fund them! Fund them just like you fund other countries.” The lawmakers were joined by Guerline Jozef, Executive Director of Haitian Bridge Alliance, Patrice Lawrence, Executive Director of UndocuBlack Network, Mary Estimé-Irvin, Chairwoman of National Haitian American Elected Officials Network, Tessa Petit, Executive Director of Florida Immigrant Coalition, and impacted families and TPS recipients. “It’s urgent for President Biden to re-designate and extend TPS for Haiti,” said Guerline Jozef, Co-Founder and Executive Director, Haitian Bridge Alliance. “Equally vital is for the United States Congress to pass an economic package supporting job creation and key infrastructure projects. Additionally, the Biden administration must immediately cease the deportation of Haitian nationals. Sending people to a country plagued by insecurity and humanitarian crises is  unconscionable. The disparate treatment of Black immigrants must come to an end!” “UndocuBlack Network calls on the Biden- Harris administration to end the cruelty against Haitians. It is cruel to deport Haitian nationals while arranging for evacuation of American nationals at the same time. Our ask is simple, honor the dignity of Haitian people. If Secretary Mayorkas leads by these values, he will release Haitians from detention, extend and redesignate TPS for Haiti and stop the deportations now. To be the change President Biden claimed to be, he must act differently from his predecessors especially as it relates to Black immigrants,” said Patrice Lawrence, Executive Director, UndocuBlack Network. “The painful reality of the Haitian people is complex and multi-layered.  However, the immediate steps that need to be taken can happen with the stroke of a pen. It is time for the Administration to redesignate and extend TPS for Haiti. It is also crucial that all deportation of Haitians be immediately halted,” said Tessa Petit, Executive Director, Florida Immigrant Coalition. “Haitians need security, justice, understanding and acceptance.  That will only be possible with the will from the administration to support Haiti by addressing its root causes, through a comprehensive humanitarian and economic support that will change the future of the Haitian people.” “An economic plan akin to the Marshall Plan is essential to aid Haiti, which is located less than 90 miles from our shores, in addition to humanitarian assistance and the reconsideration of TPS,” said Mary Estimé-Irvin, Chairwoman, National Haitian American Elected Officials Network. “Like Israel, Ukraine, and Taiwan, Haiti is a sovereign nation that requires support.” Footage from the press conference can be found here, and photos can be found here. As Representative for the Massachusetts 7th Congressional District, Congresswoman Pressley serves as Co-Chair for the House Haiti Caucus and represents one of the largest Haitian diaspora communities in the country, with approximately 46,000 Haitians and Haitian-Americans living across the state and over half in the Boston metropolitan area. Additionally, Massachusetts is home to more than 4,700 Haitians with Temporary Protected Status. ### Washington DC Office 402 Cannon HOB

10,May 8,Pramila Jayapal,D,Wash.-7,"Jayapal, Padilla, Congressional Leaders, Advocates Call for Executive Action to Protect American Families","WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, Representative Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.-07), along with U.S. Senators Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, and Border Safety, Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), and Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), and Representative Nanette Barragán (D-Calif.-44), joined advocates from FWD.us, American Families United, UnidosUS, CASA, and others to call on President Biden to protect long-term undocumented immigrants in the United States. The members and advocates urged the Biden Administration to take urgent action, reportedly under consideration, to provide protections and relief for long-term undocumented individuals, including people who have been in the United States for decades, contributing in countless ways to our communities. Specifically, they called on President Biden to expand Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and to streamline pathways to lawful status for undocumented spouses of U.S. citizens, family caregivers, and other long-term residents. Padilla, Durbin, Booker, Cortez Masto, Luján, and Markey previously provided their recommendations to the Administration for executive actions to streamline immigration relief for the undocumented population and DACA recipients in the United States. “As the Biden Administration considers executive actions on immigration, we must not return to failed Trump-era policies aimed at banning asylum and moving us backwards,” said Senator Padilla. “I urge President Biden to embrace our values as a nation of immigrants and use this opportunity to instead provide relief for the long-term immigrants of this nation.” “Our hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee made clear: Dreamers are American in every way but their paperwork. They contribute to our economy and are foundational to our communities. While Republicans peddle extremist anti-immigrant rhetoric and block bipartisan reform, we need solutions now. That’s why I’m urging President Biden to use his executive authority to provide relief for long-term undocumented immigrants and ensure that families can stay together and live free of fear of deportation,” said Senator Durbin. “I’m proud to stand with advocates and my fellow legislators to reaffirm our commitment to protecting undocumented people, many of whom have been a part of our nation for decades,” said Senator Booker. “These Americans and their families remain ensnared in a dysfunctional system that offers them no path to lawful status. We call on President Biden to take decisive executive action now to provide relief to millions of people and safeguard American families at risk of being torn apart.” “There are hundreds of thousands of Nevadans who live with at least one family member who is an undocumented, long-term resident of the U.S. The President must help protect these hardworking families through executive action so they don’t pay the price for Republicans’ political games,” said Senator Cortez Masto. “The time to act is now, and I’ll keep fighting to fix our immigration system and strengthen our border security—we have to do both.” “There are thousands of immigrants who risked their life to travel to America for a better life. They’ve built lives here, and are now part of the fabric of this nation. They are deserving of a dignified path to citizenship. Both Democrats and Republicans know it’s time for us to fix our broken immigration system,” said Senator Luján. “I urge President Biden to continue working to solve our immigration challenges for our brothers and sisters who already call America home.” “With millions of undocumented immigrants currently living in fear of separation from their families, we need a more streamlined process for undocumented immigrant spouses of U.S. citizens, family caregivers, and other long-term residents to move through administrative obstacles. I will continue to advocate on behalf of DACA recipients and immigrants across this country for an immigration system that prioritizes fairness, humanity, and hope,” said Senator Markey. “President Biden should seize this critical moment by exercising his Executive Authority to rebuild our broken immigration system. We urge him to provide pathways to citizenship and protections for the millions of long-term undocumented residents who have contributed to the rich fabric of the United States,” said Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chair Nanette Barragán. “These are our uncles, aunts, parents, friends, and loved ones, who have raised their own families right here in our neighborhoods. They call America their permanent home, they deserve the chance to come out of the shadows.” “I am proud to be an immigrant, one of just two dozen naturalized citizens to serve in the United States Congress. I know—and the vast majority of the American people know—that America is fueled by the creativity, inspiration and hard work of immigrant families. Harsh, enforcement-only policies that separate families have never worked and will not work. In the meantime, the Biden Administration’s greatest successes have been in using its legal authority to provide more legal pathways through the kinds of actions we are advocating for today. We can boost our economy, enrich our communities, and actually make life better for America families across this country,” said Representative Jayapal. “Immigration relief would be a win-win for immigrant families and our nation. If given access to legal status and work permits, the long-residing undocumented would fill gaps in our workforce, increase productivity, and fuel economic growth,” said Janet Murguía, President and CEO of UnidosUS. “Polls consistently show Americans support relief for the undocumented and it’s the #1 immigration priority of Latino voters. We urge President Biden to act to protect immigrants in American families and with deep roots in the U.S., and we’ll work tirelessly to ensure immigrants sign up for the protection, so they contribute even more to our society, tax base and the economy.” “I know first hand what life in this country is as an undocumented immigrant. I also know the transformational impact of affirmative relief, and the significance of adjusting from temporary status to permanent residence. So I’m here today to urge President Biden in the strongest possible terms to provide affirmative relief via executive action. He could offer legal pathways that would allow as many of 3 million people, including Dreamers, daily caregivers, and other long-settled immigrants to continue working and contributing to their families and communities,” said Maria Praeli, Deputy Director of Government Relations & Coalitions, FWD.us. “DACA has been a lifeline for me, but thousands of DACA recipients like me could also benefit from parole in place – allowing us to adjust our status without having to leave the only country we know as home,” said Foday Turay, a DACA recipient, Assistant District Attorney for Pennsylvania, and an American Families United member. “I want to say directly to President Biden: please grant affirmative relief to protect American families like mine. Parole in place would be a beacon of hope for my family — an answered prayer that would allow me to continue to work as an attorney, contributing to my community by doing what I love. Most importantly, it would provide long-overdue relief to my son and wife, who would no longer have to worry that daddy could be taken away.” “Doing what we thought we needed to do to live our American Dream has become our nightmare. Our family was forced to separate. Our U.S. born children were forced to leave their country to be closer to their mother, and I’ve been living apart from my family for 2 years — our entire family’s mental health, my children’s opportunities, have all been deeply hurt by this separation,” said Gerardo Diaz, a U.S. citizen and an American Families United member who has had to live apart from his family for more than 2 years already. “Two years of not kissing my kids goodnight before they go to sleep and missing out on endless milestones in their young lives. President Biden, please listen to us: we know that you can use your authority to protect and reunite American families like mine. We’ve already seen you reunite families — and there are many more of us who need relief urgently, right now.”

12,May 6,Julia Brownley,D,Calif.-26,Brownley Introduces Legislation to Expand Access to Marriage and Family Therapists at VA,"Washington, DC – Today, Congresswoman Julia Brownley (D-CA) announced the introduction of the VA Marriage and Family Therapists Equity Act, legislation which would expand access to professional therapists for veterans and their families. Specifically, this bill would remove an onerous regulation that limits the practice of nearly half of all the Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists (LMFTs) employed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  Currently, VA hires LMFTs who are licensed through a variety of organizations, including the Commission on Accreditation for Marriage and Family Therapy Education (COAMFTE) program and the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy (AAMFT). On average, 30% of LMFTs do not graduate from COAMFTE programs across the nation, and in California that number rises to 95%. Despite these rates, VA’s current regulations state that only those licensed through COAMFTE may be promoted to supervisory positions. Given the limited pay and career development, this regulation discourages qualified LMFTs from wanting to work for VA.  “The current regulations for licensed marriage and family therapists at VA are overly rigorous and are not in line with industry standards, which results in nearly half of all the therapists at the VA to be extremely restricted,” said Congresswoman Brownley. “The varied needs of our nation’s veterans and their families must be addressed through the recruitment and retention of highly-qualified professionals. My bill ensures that VA can significantly expand veterans’ access to therapists and that the delivery of quality and timely care continues to be the standard, not the exception.”  “The VA hires licensed marriage and family therapists to serve as providers of essential behavioral health services to our Veterans,” said Christine Michaels, Chief Executive Officer of the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy. “However, VA policy significantly restricts the ability of these MFTs to be promoted to supervisory positions within the VA, a restriction which does nothing to improve care for Veterans while encouraging MFTs working for the VA to leave for other opportunities. This legislation will remove this restriction and encourage employee retention and continuity of care by allowing many more MFTs serving in the VA the opportunity to be promoted to supervisory positions.” “America’s veterans deserve timely access to mental health care, here in California and across our nation. CAMFT wants to thank Representative Brownley for authoring key legislation that will make it easier for more Marriage and Family Therapists to provide care within the VA system, reducing wait times for needed services and ensuring our veterans are supported,” said Joy Alafia Executive Director of the California Association of Marriage & Family Therapists. LMFTs assist individuals and couples through interpersonal conflicts, major life changes, and work to develop appropriate coping mechanisms for a variety of challenges. The unique challenges that our nation’s military and veteran families face need to be addressed through robust, wrap-around services, quality caretakers, and holistic treatment, regardless of location.  Read the full text of the VA Marriage and Family Therapists Equity Act, here. ###

13,April 23,Ayanna Pressley,D,Mass.-7,"Pressley, Clarke, Cherfilus-McCormick, Haiti Caucus Urge Biden Admin. to Protect Haitian Migrants, Send Humanitarian Assistance To Haiti","April 23, 2024 Text of Letter (PDF) WASHINGTON – Haiti Caucus Co-Chair Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07), alongside Co-Chairs Congresswoman Yvette D. Clarke (NY-09) and Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick (FL-20), led a group of 50 lawmakers urging the Biden Administration to redesignate Haiti for Temporary Protected Status (TPS), pause on deportations back to Haiti, extend humanitarian parole to any Haitians currently detained in Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s detention centers, end detention of Haitian migrants intercepted at sea, and provide additional humanitarian assistance for Haiti. “We urge the Administration to redesignate Haiti for Temporary Protected Status (TPS), halt deportations back to Haiti, and extend humanitarian parole to any Haitians currently detained in Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) detention centers. Additionally, we request your administration’s end to the detention of Haitian migrants who were interdicted at sea. The possibility of transferring them to Guantánamo Bay naval base and other offshore migrant detention centers is concerning and must not be explored. In addition, we are asking that you provide humanitarian assistance to help Haitians navigate these tragically traumatic and difficult times,” the lawmakers wrote in a letter to the Administration. Cosigners in the House include Representatives Gabe Amo, Joyce Beatty, Jamaal Bowman, Cori Bush, Tony Cardenas, Troy Carter, Greg Casar, Kathy Castor, Joaquin Castro, Emanuel Cleaver, Danny Davis, Veronica Escobar, Adriano Espaillat, Dwight Evans, Maxwell Frost, Jesus “Chuy” García, Raul Grijalva, Steven Horsford, Jonathan Jackson, Sheila Jackson Lee, Pramila Jayapal, Hank Johnson, Sydney Kamlager-Dove, Robin Kelly, Ro Khanna, Barbara Lee, Summer Lee, Jennifer McClellan, Jim McGovern, Grace Meng, Kweisi Mfume, Eleanor Holmes Norton, Ilhan Omar, Donald Payne, Mark Pocan, Mike Quigley, Delia Ramirez, Jan Schakowsky, Terri Sewell, Darren Soto, Marilyn Strickland, Bennie Thompson, Rashida Tlaib, Ritchie Torres, Marc Veasey, Nydia Velázquez, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Bonnie Watson Coleman, Williams, and Frederica Wilson.  The letter is endorsed by 140 organizations and advocacy groups including UndocuBlack Network, Haitian Bridge Alliance, Communities United for Status and Protection (CUSP), African Communities Together, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Florida Immigrant Coalition (FLIC), Haitian Americans United for Progress, Inc.

A copy of the letter can be found here. As Representative for the Massachusetts 7th Congressional District, Congresswoman Pressley serves as Co-Chair for the House Haiti Caucus and represents one of the largest Haitian diaspora communities in the country, with approximately 46,000 Haitians and Haitian-Americans living across the state and over half in the Boston metropolitan area. Additionally, Massachusetts is home to more than 4,700 Haitians with Temporary Protected Status. ### Washington DC Office 402 Cannon HOB

14,May 6,Nanette Barragán,D,Calif.-44,Rep. Barragn Secures $500k Grant for LB Housing Project,"Random Lengths News  May 5, 2024  By Daniel Rivera, Reporter On May 3, Habitat for Humanity Los Angeles announced a new eight-townhouse project in Long Beach and celebrated a $500,000 grant from Rep. Nanette Barragan’s office. The new Habitat for Humanity project will be sited on Orange Avenue in North Long Beach.  Barragan requested funding from the House Committee on Appropriations in March 2023.  In the letter, she called the project an appropriate use of taxpayer funds due to its support for constructing new homes with affordable mortgages for low-income families. “I have had the opportunity to go on their build sites, to help build homes for communities in need, for families in need of housing, so when we saw this opportunity to bring more housing to Long Beach, we said, ‘Let’s do it.’” Barragan and Habitats have been working together for years, with the representative volunteering with them before her time as a congresswoman. She and the rest of the Habitats Team see it as a crucial part of providing homes to Long Beach while also building generation wealth so that those families can stay in their homes. “We currently have 36 homes in construction like this in Downtown Long Beach. We have built over 100 homes in the city of Long Beach,” Darrell Simien, Habitat for Humanity’s Senior Vice President of Community Development told Random Lengths News.  “It’s very lucky it passed because we didn’t know if this was going to be a budget to pass in the congress,” Congresswomen Barragan said, referring to the budgetary impasse that caused by the debt ceiling crisis in 2023. The complete federal budget was passed on April 23 and signed into law by President Joe Biden the next day.   She explained that it’s difficult to get budget items earmarked in Congress due to a change in the rules for earmarking proposals that prohibit non-profits from receiving community development grants from the federal government. And that the request for the housing grant was made before this change happened back in April, any future grants from the federal government will be more difficult to get if not impossible depending on the classification of the organization. Barragan explained that ownership interest was prioritized in order to help low income families be able to attain the goal of generational wealth with an affordable mortgage that go toward financing the building of  homes.” Habitat for Humanity uses traditional contractors, volunteer labor, and the labor of prospective homeowners to build the homes.  The townhouses will be modular and fabricated off-site in a factory. The modules will then get transported to and assembled on-site with the help of contractors and volunteers.  The president and CEO of Habitats for Humanity Los Angeles Erin Rank told Random Lengths News that this approach will speed up the building process and make it possible to build the homes even faster while keeping costs down.  Each townhouse has a 1,300 square-foot floor plan, including two bedrooms, two baths, and a two-car garage along the alleyway in the back. The site used to be the North Long Beach Library, which closed in 2016 when the Michelle Obama Library on Atlantic Avenue, between Lime and East 59th Street, opened.  An acquisition loan provided the land for Long Beach Community Investment Company amounting to  $717,000. LBCIC works on behalf of the city and facilitates new homes being built in Long Beach to help address the housing shortages.  During the conference, Rank said that a “lemming library” will be installed on-site during construction to honor the history of the library that once stood there.  Stay up-to-date on District 44's latest news, updates and more!

15,May 6,Ayanna Pressley,D,Mass.-7,Rep. Pressleys Statement on Steward Health Care Bankruptcy Filing,"May 6, 2024 WASHINGTON – Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) issued the following statement on Steward Health Care’s filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy: “Steward Health Care has failed the tens of thousands of patients and workers it serves in Massachusetts and across the country, and Steward filing for bankruptcy today is another damning indictment of our for-profit healthcare system in America,” said Congresswoman Pressley. “This is a public health crisis for our communities—especially for the vulnerable patients who receive their care at Carney Hospital and St. Elizabeth’s in Dorchester—and we must do everything we can to keep Steward hospitals open and care accessible. I’m grateful to the Healey-Driscoll Administration for prioritizing an orderly transfer of ownership that protects our patients and providers, and I won’t stop fighting to hold Steward executives accountable for their gross incompetence that has put lives in the Massachusetts 7th at risk.” In January 2024, Rep. Pressley following a Boston Globe report indicating that Steward Health Care System is in dire financial condition, Rep. Pressley, Sen. Warren, and the Massachusetts congressional delegation pressed Steward to brief them on Steward’s financial position, the status of their Massachusetts facilities, and their plans to ensure the communities they serve are not abandoned.  In February 2024, Rep. Pressley joined members of the Massachusetts congressional delegation in seeking answers from Cerebrus on the private equity firm’s role in creating the current financial challenges at Steward hospitals, which threaten access to medical care for thousands of people in eastern Massachusetts. ### Washington DC Office 402 Cannon HOB

16,May 3,Mike Quigley,D,Ill.-5,Catching Up With Quigley: Week of April 29,"Dear Friend, I hope you have had a good week. I wanted to share an update on the work I did this week in Congress. On Thursday, I joined a bipartisan group of Appropriations Committee members in a visit to Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse. We visited the site by boat, were briefed at the U.S. Coast Guard Command Center, and met with local officials to discuss the role of the federal government in assisting with the recovery. Visiting the site in person made it clear just how important the rebuilding of this critical land and sea thoroughfare is. It also highlighted the need for local, state and federal partners to work together on this project. As the lead Democrat on the Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the Department of Transportation, I am committed to ensuring that our country is not only able to address emergencies like this one but also taking preemptive steps to repair damaged bridges and roads that could lead to our next disaster. The Bipartisan Infrastructure bill took critical steps to address this need and Congress must now work to fill any remaining gaps. I will continue working with my colleagues on both side of the aisle and in both chambers until our tunnels, bridges, and roads are the envy of the world. Thanks to funding provided by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Environmental Protection Agency announced the dedication of $3 billion to identify and replace lead service lines in states and territories to prevent lead exposure in drinking water and protect public health. I was pleased to see that $240 million of that funding will go directly towards our great state of Illinois. No matter where you live, everyone should have access to clean, safe drinking water. Today’s announcement is another win in the fight to see this mission through and replace dangerous lead service lines in Illinois. With efforts like these, we can build a future in which access to safe drinking water is a right, not a privilege. As the Ranking Member on the Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development (THUD) Appropriations Subcommittee, I met with the Secretary of Transportation, Pete Buttigieg and the Acting Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Adrianne Todman to discuss their respective department's funding requests for the 2025 fiscal year. In my hearing with Secretary Buttigieg, we discussed protecting the safety of our transportation workers and the department's emergency relief fund in light of the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse. During my questioning of Secretary Todman, I asked if they anticipate additional funding needs for the Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery program and how the department is addressing rising homelessness. Both hearings provided critical insight to developing a THUD appropriations bill that will effectively address our nation's transit and housing needs. Don't forget, our office is always here to help. You can call my DC office at (202) 225-4061 or my Chicago office at (773) 267-5926. You can also email me through my website at Quigley.house.gov/contact.

17,May 6,Mike Simpson,R,Idaho-2,Rep. Simpson Cosponsors Veteran Suicide Prevention Legislation,"Subscribe to receive the latest news, insights, and updates directly to your inbox. WASHINGTON—Idaho Congressman Mike Simpson cosponsored the bipartisan Not Just a Number Act, legislation to require the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to take a more comprehensive look at the factors that best prevent veteran suicide. “Behind every veteran suicide lies a heartbreaking story, a silent struggle, and an irreplaceable loss,” said Rep. Simpson. “Through expanding suicide prevention research and a thorough analysis of factors behind veteran suicide, the Not Just a Number Act would provide a better understanding how we can help veterans in their time of need. Supporting our veterans and ensuring they have the resources they need has always been one of my top priorities. Our veterans fulfilled their duty to serve us, and now, it's our responsibility to serve them.” The Not Just a Number Act would require the VA to examine benefits usage in their annual suicide prevention report to evaluate the relationship between VA benefits and veteran suicide. Additionally, this legislation would have the VA analyze which benefits have the most significant impact on preventing suicide and require the Department to issue recommendations for the expansion of those benefits in their fight to combat veteran suicides. Lastly, the bill would include a study on upstream veteran suicide prevention, create a toolkit for state and local medical examiners to improve reporting on veteran suicide and a feasibility and advisability study on elevating the VA’s suicide prevention office to the Office of the Secretary level.

18,May 3,Pramila Jayapal,D,Wash.-7,Jayapal Applauds Student Loan Cancellation for Students of Art Institutes For-Profit Colleges,"SEATTLE, WA – U.S. Representative Pramila Jayapal applauds the Biden Administration’s decision to cancel $6 billion in student loan debt for former students of the Art Institutes, a system of predatory, for-profit colleges, including the Art Institute of Seattle. “Predatory, for-profit institutions, like the Art Institutes, prey on disadvantaged students striving for a better future,” said Jayapal. “I personally met with students from the Art Institute of Seattle in 2019, the same year they closed their doors with more than 600 students unable to finish the semester. These students were left with crushing debt, incomplete degrees, and few options for recourse. I am grateful to the administration for taking this step to bring justice to students.” This step from the administration is part of the $160 billion in student debt cancellation the Biden administration has authorized, more than 10 percent of all federal student loan debt.  After meeting with students from the Art Institute in Seattle, Jayapal introduced the Students Not Profits Act to protect students from the predatory practices of for-profit colleges by ending taxpayer subsidies to these schools. Jayapal is also the lead sponsor of the College for All Act, which would eliminate tuition and fees at public colleges and universities for single-parent families making up to $125,000 and married families making up to $250,000, while also making trade school and community college free for every person across the country.

19,May 3,Brad Schneider,D,Ill.-10,10th News: CONGRESS RETURNS,"Congress returns to session today after a two-week Easter recess. While the House may have been on break, I had a very busy two weeks, first leading a delegation of my colleagues on a trip to Israel and then working around the district here at home.  Joint Schneider & Wasserman Schultz Delegations
Visiting with Israel President and First Lady Isaac and Michal Herzog In Israel, we visited both the Gaza and Lebanese borders and met with several government officials, including Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Isaac Herzog. In the meeting with the Prime Minister, we emphasized three priorities: I spoke about my trip with Jake Tapper of CNN (watch here).  After returning from my trip, I had a wonderful week at home. I visited with high school students in Winnetka, Warren Township and Antioch, as well as college students at Lake Forest College. We hosted our annual Congressional Art Competition at the College of Lake County, and I joined the STEAM Scholars students on a fascinating tour at Valent BioSciences in Libertyville. I toured several different sites around the district, including Keshet’s new facility in Highland Park, Kindercare in Round Lake, Handi-Foil Corporation in Antioch, ARCOA in Gurnee and Growmark in Hebron. As always, we had many people visit the office to share their stories, priorities and ideas.
Back in Washington, D.C., after finally passing the FY2024 spending bills, Congress must now work to catch up on the many important bills blocked by the six-month impasse over appropriations. Key among the priority legislation waiting for Congress to act is the Foreign Intelligence Security Act (FISA) reform bill, as well as a bill reauthorizing the Affordable Connectivity Program that provides internet to thousands of families in the Tenth District and is set to expire at the end of the month. Congress is also expected to act soon to address border security and pass essential national security funding for our allies Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. We are also waiting to see if the Senate will pass the bipartisan tax bill that passed overwhelmingly in the House in February. Please keep reading to learn more about happenings here at home and in Washington.  If you or your student is interested in Military Academy Service, please join me on Wednesday, April 24th from 6:00 pm to 7:30 pm for Service Academy Night. We will discuss how to apply for military academies and what you need to know throughout the nomination process. Click here to RSVP.
Representatives from each service academy will discuss their institution and the admissions process. Congressman Schneider will also discuss the Congressional nomination process. After the program concludes, students and parents will visit the tables to talk one-on-one with the academy representatives.
Students, parents, guidance counselors and school officials are welcome to attend.
Questions? Call my office at (847) 383-4870.  I was honored to join the Connecting to Classrooms Town Hall program again for a virtual conversation this year with Warren Township and Antioch Community High School students. The program, developed by a collaboration between Ohio State, Brown, and California Riverside universities, helps high school students engage with their Member of Congress on an important political issue through a “Deliberative Town Hall.”   Students at North Shore Country Day asked a variety of questions about current events and life in Congress. They are studying the election process, and we discussed what motivated me to seek public office and what it’s like to be on the campaign trail.  I enjoyed speaking with the 8:00 AM class on American Politics at Lake Forest College. (I mention the time because I was impressed by the students' waking up early for class and their insightful questions).   Valent BioSciences hosted the STEAM Scholars class and gave them a look at the exciting research work happening at their facility in Libertyville. Among the many science-related professionals working at Valent's research facility houses plant, soil, and formulation scientists, as well as microbiologists, entomologists, and chemists who work daily to help our country's agriculture flourish.
Thank you to CEO Salman Mir and John Mandel for welcoming students, Dr. Venburg and Dr. McHatton for leading our tour groups, and the rest of the Valent team for sharing more about their work and how our students can prepare now to take on the high-skill STEAM jobs of tomorrow.  I met with the Commanding Officer of Naval Station Great Lakes, Captain Steve Yargosz, the Executive Officer, Commander Terry Traweek, and Command Master Chief Jon Crisafulli. We had a wide-ranging conversation about activities at the base and around the community. One of the priorities we shared was addressing conditions at the Halsey Village neighborhood. During my time at home, I had the opportunity of visiting five of the many great companies that are standout organizations in our area.  I’m grateful to my friend Jen Phillips, who welcomed me to Keshet’s new facilities in Highland Park. Keshet Disabilities & Inclusion provides educational, recreational, vocational and social programs for individuals with intellectual disabilities, operating according to traditional Jewish values.   At the Kindercare facility in Round Lake I visited the different classrooms and talked with the management team about some of the challenges facing childcare providers. I enjoyed my time meeting the “students” ranging in age from six weeks to five years old, especially having the chance to read to one of the groups.   Thanks to the team at ARCOA for showing me around their facilities in Waukegan and Gurnee. ARCOA works with clients to securely recycle and remanufacture technology like computers, copiers and more). They serve clients around the world, including the U.S. government.  I also toured Handi-Foil’s Antioch facility, learning how they combine innovation and attention to detail to provide high-quality, American-made foil products to familiar names like Costco, Sam’s Club and Chipotle.  I visited Von Bergen Farm in Hebron to talk with Mike Von Bergen and other members of the Conserve FS and Growmark family. We talked about some of the challenges farmers face and the importance of passing the Farm Bill before the end of the year. We also shared some of Mike’s mother’s delicious apple pie. I love welcoming people to our Lincolnshire office to talk about policy, share ideas, or help tackle challenges people face in dealing with our federal agencies. Remember, if you would like to meet with me, you don’t have to travel to Washington; you can always request a meeting here at home.  The executive board of the Ukrainian Congress of America came to update me on the war in Ukraine and reinforce the importance of the House passing the essential aid bill that will help the people of Ukraine defeat Russia’s illegal invasion.  I enjoyed catching up with representatives from New York Life to talk about the important work they do serving their client's financial security needs.  Allan Navaro, Facility Administrator at DaVita’s center in Lake Villa, and Kiyomi Hamilton, Regional Director, came to our office to share the work DeVita is doing to provide for people in Lake County and across the country who are dealing with kidney disease.  Lake County Administrator Patrice Sutton and I met to discuss how we can work together to serve Lake County residents. Administrator Sutton was elected to her current position in October of 2023. WHAT’S HAPPENING IN WASHINGTON  One of the early signs of spring is the annual visit with representatives from our local Garden Clubs. This year, I welcomed guests from Lake Forest, Winnetka and Wilmette to discuss their legislative priorities for the year.  Dr. Tom Shanley (President and CEO), Susan Hayes Gordon (SVP, Chief External Affairs Officer) and Fatema Zanzi (EVP, Chief Administrative and Legal Officer) of Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital in Chicago stopped by to discuss federal policies impacting child health and issues specifically important to Lurie.  American companies play an important role in Egypt’s economy. Members of the American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt visited Washington to highlight their work and the importance of a strong U.S.-Egypt relationship.  The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum hosted a group of college-age immigrant students from Paris who traveled to the U.S. to learn more about the Holocaust and fighting hate. As a Trustee of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, I was happy to welcome them to my office and discuss my work combatting antisemitism.  My good friend Ted Deutch, a former colleague and CEO of the American Jewish Committee, sat down with members of the House Bipartisan Task Force for Combating Antisemitism to discuss the ongoing battle against antisemitism in America.  I was honored to address the ANC of Illinois during their annual visit to the Capitol to discuss the ongoing situation in Artsakh (Ngorno Karabakh) and the future of Armenian–U.S. relations.  The Asian American Hotel Owners Association met on Capitol Hill to discuss their industry with legislators and how their businesses impact their communities. I was happy to stop by and express my appreciation for their work, especially to connect with friends from home.  My dear friend David Lega, a member of the European Parliament in Brussels, and Magnus Berntsson, a member of the Swedish Parliament, dropped by to discuss shared interests between the European Union, Sweden and the United States. David is also a founder and fellow member of the Inter-Parliamentary Task Force Combating Online Antisemitism.  I met with student leaders of Olami, a worldwide outreach organization for Jewish students, leading a grassroots initiative empowering students to take a stand against antisemitism. I’ve been clear that we must call out antisemitism and all prejudice and hate wherever and whenever it rears its ugly head. Please visit my website to find resources available for everything from saving money on your internet bill to locating your local food bank and many other help lines.  My Office at the Waukegan Township is Open Every Monday to Serve You You don’t need to travel to Lincolnshire to meet with my casework team. If you need any assistance with a Passport, Medicare, Social Security, the Veterans Administration or immigration, you can now schedule an appointment to meet with our caseworkers in a location near you to discuss any federal issues you may have.

If you have any questions or need help making an appointment, you can always contact my Lincolnshire Office at (847) 383-4870.  Spring is officially here, even if the thermometer doesn’t show it. I had a great time with Julie at the annual Orchid Show at the Chicago Botanic Garden. We were dazzled by the beauty of the wide variety of orchids on display and the extraordinary creativity of the show’s design team.
As the weather begins to warm and things start to bloom around us, I hope you and your loved ones have the opportunity to enjoy the new season and visit the Garden as well as many other wonderful areas around our Tenth District. Sincerely,
Bradley S. Schneider

20,May 3,Brad Schneider,D,Ill.-10,"10th News: MAYBE, JUST MAYBE CONGRESS WILL","Maybe, just maybe we will vote this weekend on the essential national security and foreign assistance funding bill. More on that in a moment, but first, I want to reflect on a local story.  Dax with partner, Deputy John ForlenzaSource: Lake County Sheriff All of Lake County joins with the Lake County Sheriff’s Office in mourning the passing of K-9 Dax two days after the often-decorated police dog retired from service. Books could be written about the important contributions Dax made to the sheriff’s office and our community--and likely will be. Just as significant as his heroic deeds, however, was the role Dax played in connecting the community. Anyone who ever met him will remember Dax as a kind soul. 
In a fitting tribute to Dax, virtually every local news outlet ran a story about Dax’s life and loss (ABC, CBS, Fox 32, NBC, WGN, Daily Herald, Sun-Times, Chicago Tribune). May Dax’s memory live in the hearts of everyone he touched. 
Back in Washington, Congress returned to work after a short but eventful weekend. The world tensely watched Iran’s unprecedented attack on Israel last Saturday night—for the first time launching their attack from Iranian territory and involving more than 170 suicide attack drones, 30 cruise missiles, and 120 ballistic missiles. Iran’s salvo was joined with rockets fired at Israel by Hezbollah in Lebanon, militias in Syria, and the Houthis in Yemen. Thankfully, a truly remarkable alliance comprising Israel, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Kingdom of Jordan, and others coordinated to defeat 99 percent of the missiles and drones before they were able to reach their intended targets.
Following the attack, House leadership changed its original plans for the week and will now, finally, focus on the critically important national security and foreign aid funding legislation requested by the White House late last year and passed by the Senate more than two months ago. Unfortunately, rather than simply passing the single, comprehensive Senate bill, which would then immediately go to President Biden for his signature, Speaker Johnson is trying to appease the extremists in his party with a jerry-rigged set of separate bills that will at best, delay the essential aid and humanitarian assistance desperately needed by our allies in Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan. Worse yet, it’s not clear Speaker Johnson will even be able to convince the extremists to allow the bills to come to the floor for a vote.
I’m remaining in Washington into the weekend as we move toward a vote on this important legislation. I’m hopeful we will finally pass this crucial national security aid and that the Senate will quickly approve it, at long last sending it to President Biden to sign. Please keep reading to learn more about happenings here at home and in Washington.  If you or your student is interested in Military Academy Service, please join me on Wednesday, April 24th from 6:00 pm to 7:30 pm for Service Academy Night. We will discuss how to apply for military academies and what you need to know throughout the nomination process. Click here to RSVP.
After the program concludes, students and parents will visit the tables to talk one-on-one with the academy representatives. Students, parents, guidance counselors and school officials are welcome to attend.
Questions? Call my office at (847) 383-4870.  It was a pleasure to speak at and attend the Thomas W. Doig Chapter of the Credit Unions’ Legislative Breakfast in Vernon Hills. We were joined by leaders of over 19 credit unions in their Chapter, serving over 275,000 members. I enjoyed being on a panel with Sen. Dan McConchie, State Rep. Rita Mayfield, Rep. Mark Walker, and Rep. Kevin Olickal.  The Prime Minister of Japan, Fumio Kishida, addressed a joint session of Congress last Thursday as part of his week-long visit to Washington. The Prime Minister’s address served as a reminder of the important role the US has played as a global leader and the need to set aside any doubt about what our role in the world should be. Our allies, such as Japan, count on us to help foster a secure and prosperous world and deter the threats of nefarious actors.    Last week, I also worked with my colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee to set the stage for work that will happen on tax policy in 2025. In 2017, my Republican colleagues passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act through a cynical, partisan process that was a far cry from the bipartisan, long-lasting tax policy we should be focused on. I’m looking forward to working with my colleagues on tax legislation that will bring relief and lasting change for Illinoisans, including an expanded Child Tax Credit and a Sustainable Aviation Fuel tax credit that will accelerate cleaner air and skies for us all.  You can watch my remarks here.  Today marks the 194th day that more than 130 hostages, including 8 Americans, are being held in Gaza. Last week, as family members of the American hostages sat in the House Gallery, I was honored to lead a bipartisan group of colleagues on the House floor in a call for Hamas to accept the six-week ceasefire proposal brokered by the United States, Egypt, and Qatar and accepted by Israel. The agreement would immediately release all women, children, and those needing medical assistance, opening the door to a more long-term resolution to the fighting. Sadly, as of yesterday, Hamas is still refusing to accept a ceasefire deal. You can watch my remarks here.  I was happy to welcome Keeping Families Covered and Cradles to Crayons Chicago to my office in Washington, DC, to discuss diaper banks' important role in supporting families. Did you know that 1 in 2 families nationwide struggle to afford diapers? On April 3rd, Keeping Families Covered held a mobile distribution event at Warren Library in Gurnee, where they distributed:  Overall, they served 362 children and 291 families in just two hours; I applaud their work ensuring no family is left without these essential items.  Illinois TRIO helps first-generation, low-income students and students with disabilities enter and complete college. I greeted them on their visit to the Capitol, and we discussed the impacts the federal TRIO program has on Illinois students.  The Regional Transit Authority oversees the Metra, PACE, and the CTA. I welcomed their leadership team to my office to discuss their funding and planning priorities for the next fiscal year.  I met with Advocates from the Alzheimer's Association and Alzheimer's Impact Movement (AIM). We discussed my cosponsorship of the NAPA Reauthorization Act, which supports coordinating federal programs addressing Alzheimer's disease. Please visit my website to find resources available for everything from saving money on your internet bill to locating your local food bank, and various help lines.  Did you know that when Ukraine was under Soviet rule, Matzah baking was a criminal activity? Today, Ukraine is the largest exporter of Matzah outside of Israel! Just days before Passover begins on Monday, I was fortunate to receive a box of Shmurah Matzah that was hand-made in Ukraine from friends with the Ua-Resistance, a charity fund for Ukraine. 
Wishing you and yours a Chag Pesach Sameach should you celebrate the Festival of Freedom.  
Sincerely,
Bradley S. Schneider

21,May 3,Brad Schneider,D,Ill.-10,"10th News: Happy Passover, Bipartisanship in DC, and Celebrating a Local Hero","For all of those observing, I hope you are having a meaningful Passover! The big news of the week was that on Saturday, the House finally passed critical national security funding that will help our allies Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan counter threats from Russia, Hamas, and China. I was proud to join with House Democratic leadership to insist that, in addition to the security aid for our allies, the legislative package had to also include significant humanitarian assistance, in particular for civilians in Gaza caught in the middle of the fighting between Hamas and Israel.  With Senate passage on Tuesday and President Biden’s signature on Wednesday, the U.S. can now deliver desperately needed military aid to soldiers in Ukraine and humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza and around the world. I’m proud to be part of the bipartisan coalition that advanced this crucial legislation to help our allies – and America’s interests, as well.  I’m also proud to join many others in our community in commending a local hero – Lake County sheriff’s 911 dispatcher Christy O’Dette. Last weekend, Christy calmly and expertly helped save the life of a man attempting suicide in Green Oaks. Please read more about Christy’s great work here. Please keep reading to learn more about happenings in Washington and here at home.  Because of the extended week in Washington to pass the foreign aid bills, I had to cancel many events and meetings at home on Friday and Saturday. Luckily, I was able to get home in time to attend the Lake Forest College Public Policy Analysis Challenge. The Public Policy Challenge is a year-long program where 16 teams, each working with a faculty mentor, developed and presented public policy ideas on how to reduce violence in America. On Sunday, the three teams that had earlier advanced to the final round formally presented their proposals to a panel for four judges. I was honored to be able to provide remarks at the start of the evening.  Last week, on the heels of Iran’s recent attack on Israel, the House passed H.R. 6408, a commonsense, bipartisan bill I introduced with Congressman David Kustoff to revoke the tax-exempt status of non-profits that have provided material support to specially designated terror groups (STDGs) or foreign terrorist organizations (FTOs). Put simply, groups giving support to terrorism should not have the privilege of advantaged tax status. You can watch my remarks on the bill here.  US Trade Representative Katherine Tai testified before the House Ways and Means Committee about the Administration’s trade priorities. During my time to ask questions of Trade Representative Tai, I highlighted our district’s researchers and innovators, all of whom depend on intellectual property protections. I am grateful for the Biden Administration’s tireless work in protecting US innovation. We also spoke about the importance of strengthening medical-related supply chains and working with trusted trade partners, rather than duplicitous actors like China. You can watch my remarks on the bill here.  Prior to passage of the foreign aid bills last Saturday, the House Foreign Affairs Committee held a hearing on the threat posed to U.S. interests by Russo–Iranian cooperation. I asked each of the three witnesses what they considered the most important action for Congress to take to address the growing threat posed by the growing alliance between two of our country’s greatest adversaries. The witnesses all agreed that there is nothing more important than passing the national security funding bills for Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan. Speaker Johnson should have brought to a vote the Senate-passed bill long ago—I’m glad the House was able to deliver that vote over the weekend. You can watch my remarks here.  Representatives of the Illinois Health and Hospital Association were in Washington to discuss the SAVE Act, which would create legal penalties for individuals who knowingly and intentionally assault hospital employees. Hospital employees are a cornerstone of our healthcare system; as a proud cosponsor of the SAVE Act, I remain committed to keeping hospitals a safe place for healthcare workers.   Our district is home to a wonderful variety of wildlife. I had the opportunity to meet with representatives of Openlands, an organization dedicated to preserving this wildlife and connecting people throughout Illinois to the outdoors. I appreciate their efforts to expand Hackmatack National Wildlife Refuge in McHenry County, and I look forward to continuing to support the first federal wildlife refuge within 100 miles of Chicago.   As we raced toward the final passage of funding for Ukraine last week, I had the opportunity meeting with UA-Resistance, a charity fund that helps Ukrainians defend against Putin’s continued invasion. And, in anticipation of Passover, they brought a box of special matzah made in Ukraine. I was surprised to learn that Ukraine exports matzahs around the world.   As a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, one of my most important responsibilities is building stronger relationships with leaders from around the globe. Last week, I had a robust conversation with Youssef Amrani, the Ambassador of Morocco. Especially in times like these, we must continue to strengthen the US-Morocco partnership and work toward a Middle East that is peaceful, prosperous, and secure.  I also met with Ekaterini Nassika, the Ambassador of Greece. We discussed cooperation on energy security amid global conflicts and opportunities to continue the longstanding partnership between the United States and Greece. Please visit my website to find resources available for everything from saving money on your internet bill to locating your local food bank, and various help lines.  In case you missed it, the Washington Post opined last week that, while traditional thinking has always held that humanity tamed dogs, it might be that dogs were the key to our advancement all along. As the author puts it: “Dogs enabled humans to settle down and stop their endless wandering. Dogs protected humans at this vulnerable transition from nomadic to settled life.” While I do not claim to be a biology expert, I can say from personal experience that dogs truly are humanity’s greatest partners. As I enjoy my time in the district—alongside my trusted canine companion, JoJo—I hope this article brings levity and joy into your day, just as it did mine. 
Sincerely,
Bradley S. Schneider

22,May 3,Brad Schneider,D,Ill.-10,10th News: A Week at Home and a Weekend in the Middle East,"It sure was nice to be home last week, especially after two long weeks and a rare Saturday session in Washington. As always, I enjoyed traveling around the district, with visits to Northfield, Wheeling, Deerfield, Highland Park, Waukegan, Libertyville, and more. Each week at home is distinct, but last week was special—I had the chance to meet with many students, including through student town halls at Caruso and Edgewood Middle Schools, a lunch and learn session with the Together Towards Peace Roundtable and our annual Service Academy/ROTC Information Night with representatives from the Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force and Coast Guard, this year at Vernon Hills High School.
Before I share highlights of my week at home, I want to provide expanded thoughts on a trip I took this weekend, as well as some thoughts about the protests we are seeing on campuses around the country. This past weekend, I had a very special opportunity. I was invited to be a guest speaker at the World Economic Forum’s Special Meeting on Global Collaboration, Growth and Energy for Development in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. This event brought together nearly 1,000 senior leaders in government, business and NGOs from across the globe for discussions about topics ranging from climate change and clean energy to global trade policy to the future prospects for Middle East peace and development. In addition to my specific session on “Homeland Trade,” I had an opportunity to meet with high-level officials from Saudi Arabia, the United States and other countries to discuss the situation in Gaza and possibilities for a new direction for the entire Middle East. We talked about hopes for a ceasefire with the release of the hostages and a surge in aid into Gaza. I heard about continued plans for pursuing further normalization agreements with Israel, and everyone I met wanted my opinion about the upcoming election in the United States.
I returned early to Washington for votes in the House and so I left the conference early Monday morning, before Secretary of State Blinken arrived later in the day. I wish I could have heard Secretary Blinken’s remarks, but I share his and President Biden’s view that we are at an inflection point in the Middle East. I also agree that, while U.S. leadership is critically important, we cannot meet the challenges around the world without strong partners and allies.
Perhaps the biggest surprise from my short visit to Riyadh is that I left the conference feeling that there is hope for the future. Based on all I heard, I believe that peace between Saudi Arabia and Israel is within reach – something that creates an unprecedented opportunity to change the trajectory of relations in the region and prove Hamas’s barbaric attacks on October 7 were a fatal strategic error. You can read my official statement about my visit here, and if you are interested, you can watch my panel session here. As I write this, the world is waiting for Hamas to respond to the latest ceasefire proposal brokered by Egypt, Qatar and the United States. Secretary Blinken, speaking in Riyadh, called the deal “extraordinarily generous on the part of Israel.”  Unfortunately, the Secretary left the region on Wednesday without a response from Hamas leadership.
Meanwhile, I’ve been closely watching, with growing concern, the protests on college campuses around the country, including my alma mater Northwestern. And I am aware the protests are spreading to high schools as well.
I am and will always be a fierce advocate for and defender of free speech. I believe everyone has the right to have their say and speak their minds, no matter how vehemently I may disagree with their point of view. Freedom of speech does not, however, include the right to harass, isolate or threaten others. Nor does it allow for the violation of university rules and vandalism of campus property. 
I fully recognize and appreciate the immense sadness and pain felt and strong views held by students that identify with both sides of the conflict in Gaza. I understand that pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel advocates are deeply passionate and want their perspectives to be heard and their positions wholly adopted. And I believe there should be no better place than the college to have a robust and thoughtful debate. Sadly, instead of dialogue, we have seen too much of each side trying to drown out the other, as well as outside groups and individuals entering campus grounds to feed the flames.
I have been particularly appalled by images of many anti-Israel protestors holding rabidly antisemitic signs, chanting slogans celebrating terrorism and violence, and physically threatening and even assaulting other students. It is the responsibility of school leadership to ensure the safety and security of all students at their universities and colleges.
I’ve been extremely disappointed by the responses of many university leaders that have failed to adequately, or even minimally, protect the well-being of all students. Some schools have in fact conceded to the demands of people spewing vile, hateful, demeaning and too often antisemitic rhetoric. We need university leaders to step up and speak out against hate and discrimination, enforce their school’s rules of time, place and manner and do everything in their power to ensure healthy academic communities that allow every student to thrive, irrespective of from where they hail, to what god they pray or how they choose to identify themselves. As for those that cause physical harm to others or intentionally damage school property—schools and their leaders must make sure these individuals are held fully accountable for their behaviors.  I joined MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell Reports this week to discuss my recent trips to both Saudi Arabia and Israel, as well as campus protests – you can watch that interview here. Please keep reading to learn more about happenings in Washington and here at home. I started my week in the district by grabbing lunch at Brunch Café with Village of Deerfield Mayor Dan Shapiro and village officials Kent Street and Andrew Lichterman. I appreciated the updates on the village's economic development projects. The pain of losing a loved one to gun violence never fades. Sadly, this is a pain shared by many in our community, from Highland Park to Waukegan. I joined Lake County Leaders and victims of gun violence in Waukegan to discuss the work of the Gun Violence Prevention Initiative. The work being carried out is making a real impact in our community and serving as a model for the rest of the country. I thank the Lake County State's Attorney for helping us invest in bettering our community's safety. I was thrilled to join the Housing Opportunity Development Corporation, State Senator Julie Morrison, State Representative Bob Morgan and community members to break ground on the Zion Woods Affordable Housing Complex. This is a meaningful step toward increasing Deerfield’s affordable housing supply. Mental health is crucial for the well-being of our communities. I joined the Josselyn team in Northbrook to celebrate the kickoff of their annual capital campaign. I'm proud to support their success and work with them to eliminate barriers to mental health services. Last year, I was pleased to successfully advocate for $1 million in federal funding for the center’s new headquarters. I’m always glad to have the opportunity to visit with students and hear about what’s on their mind. I am always amazed at how tuned in to the world they are and how insightful their questions are. At the risk of being boastful, I was invited by my nephew Brady (with my niece Mia) to a town hall conversation with the entire 7th grade at Caruso Middle School. The students asked some of the smartest questions and fully engaged in a vibrant discussion. After a full hour, we all only wished we had more time together. Different day, different school-- this time at Edgewood Middle School. Once again, I was blown away by the questions and tried my best to meet the students’ high expectations. The big surprise was the last question at the end, when a student asked how I order my burritos. Based on the cheers, I am not the only one who likes brown rice, chicken, peppers, onions, lots of veggies, lettuce and cheese. Every year my office hosts students and parents from across the 10th District to learn about the application and nomination process for the five U.S. Military Service Academies, as well as opportunities for ROTC. This year we were graciously hosted by Vernon Hills High School and were honored to be joined via Zoom by Midshipman Andrew Bacilek, who I had the honor of nominating to the US Naval Academy in 2020. Andrew is a member of 13th Company and is a proud member of the class of 2024. As a Navy Dad, it is always encouraging to see so many promising and talented young people interested in serving and protecting their country, and I commend both these students and their families for their hard work and commitment. Each semester, our district and DC offices are joined by a select group of talented and enthusiastic interns who are interested in careers in public service. This semester was no exception. Throughout their time with us, Colin, Liz and Johanna all became important parts of our district team. While we will miss them at the district office, I know they are destined for bright futures ahead. I once again had the opportunity to attend the annual Lake County Mikva Challenge Issues-To-Action Showcase in Waukegan. This year’s event featured civics action projects from schools across our district. The students effectively identified issues that they are passionate about and assessed ways to have an impact around that issue. I enjoyed hearing about each of their projects, and I look forward to seeing them put their strategies into action. I ended my week in the district meeting with students from Highland Park High School and Baker College Prep at a Together Towards Peace Event at Rosewood Beach Interpretive Center.  I joined a panel discussion with Majority Leader for the IL House of Representatives Robyn Gabel, State Rep. Bob Morgan, and Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering for a broad discussion on gun violence and its impact on these students’ communities. I appreciated the opportunity to hear about their personal experiences and perspective, as well as their ideas on advocating for safe gun legislation. As we continue our work in Congress to pass gun control reform, I will for sure keep these students’ ideas in mind.    I welcomed (ret.) Henry P. (Hank) Krakowski to my office. Captain Krakowski has over forty years of aviation experience including three years as Chief Operating Officer of the Federal Aviation Administration and served in numerous positions at United Airlines. We had a great conversation on the rapidly developing zero-emission Advance Air Mobility industry and sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). I had a great time with Allendale President Jason Keeler and new team member Amir Bastanipour. We discussed Allendale’s STAR Program (Shelter & Transitional Adolescent Resources program) for runaway locked-out and homeless youth. I appreciate the work they do to support vulnerable youth; and I’m also very grateful for the plant he gifted my office. Nancy Richman, a constituent of Highland Park, dropped by to advocate for The Medicare Home Health Accessibility Act (H.R.7148). I met with Carole Rosen and other members of the Going Home Coalition and The Arc of Illinois to discuss what more can be done at the federal level to bring more awareness to disability issues. Please visit my website to find resources available for everything from saving money on your internet bill to locating your local food bank, and various help lines. And, as always, I’m happy to meet constituents in my Lincolnshire office to share ideas, discuss legislation, or catch up on what’s happening in our community. If you want to schedule a meeting with me, you can do so here. It’s NBA playoff time, but sadly the Bulls are no longer in the mix. Nevertheless, I have a basketball related story I thought might be of interest. Actually, not so much a story as an interesting comparison: Did you know that a full-grown adult blue whale, the largest animal ever to live on Planet Earth, is longer than a basketball court?!           Source: Dana Wharf Blog Blue whales are listed as endangered, with an estimated remaining population of between 5,000 and 15,000.  That’s why I was so excited to see a story about blue whales returning to the Seychelles. So many species around the world are threatened with extinction, either directly by human activities or indirectly by effects of climate change (caused by human activities). The good news is that we are learning how to successfully help many species begin to recover.
Have a wonderful weekend. Sincerely, Bradley S. Schneider

23,May 3,Nanette Barragán,D,Calif.-44,Rep. Barragn Statement on Biden Administration Announcing $3 Billion in Funding to Replace Lead Pipes,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 3 May 2024 Contact: Kevin G. McGuire, 202-538-2386 (mobile) Kevin.McGuire@mail.house.gov WASHINGTON, DC: Today, Congresswoman Nanette Barragán (CA-44) released the following statement after the Biden-Harris Administration announced $3 billion from the Infrastructure Law to identify and replace lead service lines in every state in the country. “We’ve known for years that there is no safe level of lead exposure,” said Rep. Barragán. “The primary source of lead pollution for Americans is in outdated, lead-lined water pipes that service countless homes around the nation. With this historic investment of $3 billion, with $28.65 million to California, we can finally identify and replace these harmful pipes. I was proud to sign onto a letter to urge our leadership to fund lead pipe replacement in the Infrastructure Law.  Thank you to the Biden-Harris Administration and the EPA for prioritizing clean, safe drinking water for families.” # # # Congressmember Nanette Barragán represents California’s 44th District.  She sits on the House Energy and Commerce Committee and works on environmental justice and healthcare issues.  She is also Chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC).

24,May 3,Mike Simpson,R,Idaho-2,Rep. Simpson Supports Bill to Stop Biden Administrations Land Grab,"Subscribe to receive the latest news, insights, and updates directly to your inbox. WASHINGTON— This week, the United States House of Representatives passed the Western Economic Security Today (WEST) Act. Idaho Congressman Mike Simpson—a cosponsor of the WEST Act—voted in favor of this legislation. This bill withdraws the Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM) recently finalized “Public Lands Rule” and would prevent future issuance of a substantially similar rule. The BLM’s rule is a seismic shift in public land management that upends the agency’s multiple use mandate, which has guided land management practices across the West for 50 years. “This rule will significantly impact how Idahoans interact and enjoy the 12 million acres of BLM land across the state,” said Rep. Simpson. “For decades, Idahoans have cherished the concept of multiple use on public lands and have proven to be responsible stewards. The rule jeopardizes years of successful management and collaboration by the very people who rely on our federal lands for ranching, grazing, recreation, and more. As Chairman of the House Interior and Environment Appropriations Subcommittee—which has jurisdiction over the BLM—I will continue to push back against this misguided rule.” The measure was approved with a vote of 212-202.",Main Street,"['subscribe receive latest news insight update directly inbox', 'week united state house representative passed western economic security today west act', 'idaho congressman mike cosponsor west favor legislation', 'bill withdraws bureau land management blm recently finalized public land rule would prevent future issuance substantially similar rule', 'blm rule seismic shift public land management upends agency multiple use mandate guided land management practice across west year', 'rule significantly impact idahoan interact enjoy million acre blm land across state said simpson', 'decade idahoan cherished concept multiple use public land proven responsible steward', 'rule jeopardizes year successful management collaboration people rely federal land ranching grazing recreation', 'chairman house interior environment appropriation jurisdiction continue push back misguided measure approved vote']",subscribe receive latest news insight update directly inbox week united state house representative passed western economic security today west act idaho congressman mike cosponsor west favor legislation bill withdraws bureau land management blm recently finalized public land rule would prevent future issuance substantially similar rule blm rule seismic shift public land management upends agency multiple use mandate guided land management practice across west year rule significantly impact idahoan interact enjoy million acre blm land across state said simpson decade idahoan cherished concept multiple use public land proven responsible steward rule jeopardizes year successful management collaboration people rely federal land ranching grazing recreation chairman house interior environment appropriation jurisdiction continue push back misguided measure approved vote

26,May 3,Morgan Griffith,R,Va.-9,Congressman Griffiths Weekly E-Newsletter 5.3.24,"Our country is experiencing a massive shift in technology. Our daily activities often revolve around computers and smartphones.   Our Information Technology (IT) infrastructure grows daily. But so do the threats of cyberattacks.   This week, the Energy & Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight & Investigations, which I chair, held a hearing focused on the fallout from the February 2024 cyberattack on Change Healthcare.    Change Healthcare (Change), a UnitedHealth subsidiary that was acquired by them in 2022, operates the largest Electronic Data Interchange clearinghouse in the nation, transmitting more than 15 billion transactions every year.    When the hack was discovered, UnitedHealth shut down its Change Healthcare networks. This action had profound consequences for providers and patients.   According to the American Hospital Association, 94 percent of hospitals reported being financially impacted by the cyberattack. Hospitals, clinics, medical practices and pharmacies across the country were prevented from getting paid and could not submit claims. Stopping all payments on claims made it difficult for providers and patients. An unknown number of patients had their care delayed.    These consequences were widely discussed on a bipartisan basis during the hearing, which featured UnitedHealth CEO, Sir Andrew Witty.    Patients reeled from this cutoff, prompting them to either walk away, pay large sums of money out of pocket for their medications or borrow money. I am sure some had to use credit cards with high interest rates.   NBC News reported patients not being able to afford their medication without copay assistance cards, such as patients at the Marion Family Pharmacy in Marion, Virginia.   One individual was forced to pay $1,100 for medication because the Marion pharmacy was unable to process her copay assistance card.   When I raised this issue to Mr. Witty, I asked how were this lady and other people similarly situated going to be made whole for their loss. He seemed empathetic.   But it was clear to me that UnitedHealth did not have a plan on how to take care of patients who had been harmed.   He had no answer as to how much paperwork would be requested from a patient in order to be fully reimbursed. It is not just the $1,100. It’s the interest on that money that UnitedHealth got to keep and receive interest on while the patient was possibly paying interest to a lender.    There is also the possibility of increased medical attention needed for patients that were denied medicine or services because their insurance could not be processed.   I hope in the coming weeks UnitedHealth will formulate a plan for making patients whole.   Another problem is how does UnitedHealth take care of healthcare providers.    Providers were kept in the dark when claims were not being processed and sparked fears of closures. Congresswoman Schrier (D-WA) told Witty a private practitioner in her district had to mortgage their home to make office rent and payroll.    UnitedHealth “helped” them out by giving them a $70 first-round loan. Big help!   It is true the hackers were the bad guys, but as I said in my opening statement, UnitedHealth’s Change did not have Multi Factor Authentication (MFA), which is a standard cyber protection tool. The criminals exploited this weakness allowing them access into the system.   Mr. Witty attributed the technology failure to Change’s outdated system.   As the largest health care conglomerate in the United States, this response was concerning.   Over 50 percent of U.S. medical claims are processed through Change’s EDI clearinghouse. UnitedHealth Group’s vast network encompasses Optum, Optum Rx pharmacies, urgent care centers, United Healthcare Medicare and Retirement plans, including AARP Medicare plans, 10,000 doctors and other subsidiaries.   Given UnitedHealth’s sweeping consolidation of medical companies, the company stands as a prime target for bad actors.   It begs the question whether one company should be able to control a market share of this magnitude in the healthcare arena.   I do not claim to know the answer, but the question must be asked.   UnitedHealth had an obligation to protect their customers. They failed! And they failed to have a secure backup plan.    Small medical practices and hospitals are hurting. But the most vulnerable to this incident were the people showing up at their healthcare provider needing care and at their pharmacy needing to get their medicine.   UnitedHealth has a big mess to clean up. Going forward, my Subcommittee will examine their actions and then we can determine if UnitedHealth is truly committed to rectifying their mistake.    If you have questions, concerns, or comments, feel free to contact my office.  You can call my Abingdon office at 276-525-1405 or my Christiansburg office at 540-381-5671.  To reach my office via email, please visit my website at https://morgangriffith.house.gov.     ### Enter your email address to get the latest updates straight to your inbox.

27,May 2,Ayanna Pressley,D,Mass.-7,Pressley Applauds New Regulations to Strengthen Protections Against Disability Discrimination,"May 2, 2024 Finalized HHS Rules Advances Equity, Bolsters Protections For People With Disabilities Under Section 504 Of The Rehabilitation Act Pressley Has Long Urged Admin. to Improve Access to Healthcare for Folks with Disabilities WASHINGTON – Today, Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) issued a statement applauding the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) finalized rule that prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability. This rule, titled Discrimination on the Basis of Disability in Health and Human Service Programs or Activities, advances equity and bolsters protections for people with disabilities under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (Section 504). Rep. Pressley has been a longtime champion for the disability community and recently wrote to the Biden Harris Administration urging the Administration to improve access to healthcare for folks with disabilities. “The unjust status quo has subjected our neighbors with disabilities to daily injustices,” said Congresswoman Pressley. “This much-needed and long-overdue rule is a historic step forward that will help prevent discrimination for folks with disabilities and help them access healthcare and other services they need and deserve. I’m grateful to Secretary Becerra and the Biden-Harris Administration for heeding advocates’ calls and look forward to working with them to further advance disability justice at the federal level.” Reflecting over fifty years of advocacy by the disability community, the Section 504 Final Rule clarifies and strengthens civil rights protections for people with disabilities, addresses discrimination in medical treatment, adds enforceable standards for accessible medical diagnostic equipment, and ensures accessible web content and mobile apps. The rule advances the promise of the Rehabilitation Act and helps protect people with disabilities from experiencing discrimination in any program or activity receiving funding from HHS because of their disability. Section 504 prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in programs and activities that receive funding from HHS. Since the law was enacted, major legislative and judicial developments have shifted the legal landscape of disability discrimination under Section 504. More information about the finalized rule is available here. Rep. Pressley has been a longtime advocate the disability community and has championed policies that promote disability justice. ### Washington DC Office 402 Cannon HOB

29,May 2,Ayanna Pressley,D,Mass.-7,"Pressley, Watson Coleman, Booker, Colleagues Reintroduce CROWN Act to Fight Race-Based Hair Discrimination","May 2, 2024 CROWN Act Has Already Been Enacted In 23 States and Dozens Of Cities Nationwide Text of Bill (PDF) | Press Conference (YouTube) WASHINGTON – Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) joined Representatives Bonnie Watson Coleman (NJ-12), Barbara Lee (CA-13), Ilhan Omar (MN-05), Gwen Moore (WI-04), Summer Lee (PA-12) and Maxwell Frost (FL-10) to announce the reintroduction of the Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair (CROWN) Act in the House of Representatives, a bill to outlaw discrimination on the basis of hair texture. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) also announced reintroduction of the CROWN Act in the Senate.  The lawmakers unveiled the legislation at a Capitol Hill press conference. Full video of the press conference is available here. “It is 2024 and discrimination against natural hair continues to disrupt our lives. No one should have the right to punish Black folks for showing up as our full, authentic selves – not in Massachusetts, Texas, or anywhere else,” said Rep. Ayanna Pressley. “We need a federal CROWN Act now more than ever. Whether you are a student in a classroom, an employee in the workplace, or the next Supreme Court Justice, you belong everywhere as you are. I am proud to join my sisters-in-service in reintroducing this crucial legislation to end race-based hair discrimination in America once and for all.” “Our hair plays a significant role in our overall well-being, self-esteem, cultural identity, and personal expression,” said Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman. “Discrimination against Black hair is discrimination against Black people. And we’re going to put a stop to it. I’m grateful to the broad coalition that has developed to pass this legislation and look forward to working with them to ensure everyone can live as their authentic selves.” “Nobody should face harassment or discrimination based on their natural hair, and the CROWN Act is an effort to heal a systemic bias that tells Black people that who they inherently are is wrong,” said Senator Booker. “Prejudice against Black hair demeans an important foundation of our identity and cultural heritage. It’s time that the long and storied history of implicit and explicit biases against natural hair comes to an end. Black hair is beautiful in all of its forms and styles, and we must ensure individuals are free to express their cultural identities without fear of prejudice or bias.” “There is a longstanding history of racial discrimination against natural hair and protective styles in the workplace, schools, and society at large. Purportedly race-neutral grooming policies that reinforce Eurocentric standards of beauty and myopic notions of what constitute professional hair are problematic. To that end, since 2018, I have worked tirelessly to pass the CROWN Act and shift culture to mitigate the physical, psychological, and economic harm caused by race-based hair discrimination,” said Dr. Adjoa B. Asamoah who is the scholar and strategist leading the nationwide CROWN Act movement. “We must work collectively to protect our children, like Darryl George, and ensure they have positive educational experiences. I am grateful for the partnership and leadership of Congresswoman Watson Coleman and Senator Booker.” “I am proud to stand with my colleagues Rep. Watson Coleman, Rep. Pressley, Rep. Omar, and Rep. Moore to reintroduce the CROWN Act,” said Rep. Barbara Lee. “Hair discrimination is rooted in systemic racism and is a real barrier to advancement and empowerment for people of color.  For far too long, GOP dysfunction has blocked this legislation, but we will not relent until Black people can wear their natural hair however they see fit, without fear of discrimination. No one should feel forced to change who they are in order to secure a job or fair and decent housing.” “Hair discrimination is a reality that Black people face daily across America – in schools, workplaces, and public spaces,” said Rep. Ilhan Omar. “Natural hair textures and protective styles have unfairly subjected people to discrimination, missed opportunities, and humiliation. The CROWN Act draws a firm line, making it crystal clear that this form of race-based discrimination will not be tolerated. No one deserves to be judged or held back because of their hair texture or cultural hairstyle.” “In our country, Black women’s hair is 2.5x more likely to be perceived as unprofessional and over 20% of Black women have been sent home from work because of their hair. A student in my former PA House District was once told ‘change your hair or go home,’” said Rep. Summer Lee. “I was proud to introduce the CROWN Act during my time in Pennsylvania, and look forward to taking this fight in Congress–because it’s long past time to make respect for our beautiful Black hair the law of the land in this country.” “It’s 2024 and Black hair is still criminalized,” said Rep. Gwen Moore. “We need the CROWN Act to affirm that any person – no matter their hair texture or style – should be free to wear their hair as it grows out of their head without facing discrimination at work or school. I’m proud to wear my sister locs in Congress and I’m excited to partner on this bill with so many of my trailblazing colleagues.” “I applaud Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman and Senator Cory Booker for their leadership in reintroducing the CROWN Act to bring forward necessary change,” said Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus Steven Horsford. “For too long, race-based hair discrimination, which permeates every part of our society from the workplace to the classroom, has been historically used to shut off access to educational and employment opportunities for Black Americans. Students like Darryl George in Anahuac, Texas should not be barred from his classroom, and Black women all over our country should not be forced to change their hair to be accepted in the workplace. We must pass the CROWN Act on the national level to finally outlaw race-based hair discrimination.” “Racial discrimination can come in many different shapes and forms, with hair discrimination chief among them,” said Rep. Maxwell Frost. “No one should be discriminated against because of the color of their skin or the texture of their hair — but that’s exactly what’s happening in our country. In schools, in places of business, and beyond, folks with textured hair, mainly Black men and women, are finding themselves with the doors of opportunity closed to them simply because of their natural hair. Enough is enough. I’m proud to help introduce the CROWN Act alongside Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman to help us bring an end to this discrimination.” The CROWN Act, which has already been enacted in 23 states and dozens of cities nationwide, would help bring an end to race-based hair discrimination in schools and workplaces, removing a barrier to educational and economic opportunity facing many Black Americans and people of color. In the school setting, Black students are disciplined at a rate four times higher than any other racial or ethnic group, and research has found that 70 percent of all suspension disciplines are discretionary, many stemming from dress code violations, including “unapproved” hair styles. Meanwhile, in the workplace, bias against ethnic and natural hairstyles contributes to reduced opportunities for job advancement, particularly for women. Over 20% of young Black women have been sent home from work because of their hair. One-third of Black women under 34 believe they have been denied a job interview because of their hair. The CROWN Act passed the House of Representatives in 2019 and 2022 but was blocked in the Senate. The CROWN Act would: “Bravo to Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman for reintroducing the CROWN Act, which seeks to undo generations of systemic hair discrimination that’s done immeasurable harm to so many individuals,” said SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher. “It’s time to end these discriminatory practices. I applaud lawmakers who push for the real change necessary to achieve equity in the workplace and public schools. An acceptance of the diversity of the human experience will be the greatest step towards peace on earth.” “As an advocate for equality and fairness in all aspects of society, APFA proudly endorses the CROWN Act, or the Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair Act,” said Julie Hedrick, National President of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA). “The CROWN Act aims to end race-based discrimination because of hair texture or protective hairstyles. While already passed in some states and municipalities, the bill would provide critical federal-level protection for individuals who might otherwise be judged or penalized based on their natural hair texture or style. Flight Attendants, like all individuals, deserve a work environment free from bias and discrimination. APFA commends Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, representing the 12th district of New Jersey, for introducing the CROWN Act and we look forward to advocating for its passage. Together, we can work towards a future where everyone, regardless of their hairstyle, can feel valued, respected, and accepted in both the workplace and beyond.”“No one should be punished, harassed, or discriminated against for wearing a hairstyle that is reflective of themselves and their cultural heritage,” said Denise Forte, President and CEO of EdTrust. “Yet many Black students routinely face disciplinary consequences for their natural or ethnic hairstyles: 53% of Black mothers say their daughters experienced hair discrimination by age five; and 86% of Black teens state they experienced hair discrimination by age 12. For example, a Houston-area high school student has been suspended since last August because of his locs. In a lawsuit, a Texas judge ruled in favor of the school district, further codifying natural hair discrimination and shamelessly upholding standards of white supremacy. The CROWN Act would help bring an end to race-based hair discrimination and allow for a more supportive school environment for students of color — particularly Black students, who bear the brunt of hair criminalization.” “All students, no matter their race or place, deserve equal access to educational opportunities,” said National Education Association President Becky Pringle. “They deserve the right to be their true authentic selves without fear of subjective discipline or body shaming. However, too often, the same politicians who ban books and demonize transgender students want to tell Black girls what to wear and Black kids how to wear their hair. This small group of people in power is threatening the success of our students in school and beyond with their anti-Black hair policies. The National Education Association applauds the introduction of the CROWN Act because it acknowledges that people of color in K-12 public schools, workplaces, housing, and public accommodations face hair-based discrimination, and the legislation creates consequences for those who are responsible for it. More to the point, we welcome the proposal’s attempt to expand federal protections to end hair discrimination nationwide. By joining across race and place, we can create real change and contribute to the movement to end hair discrimination and to ensure every student has access to a safe, welcoming public school free from discrimination where they can thrive into their brilliant selves.” In addition to Reps. Ayanna Pressley, Barbara Lee, Ilhan Omar, Gwen Moore, Summer Lee, and Maxwell Alejandro Frost, the CROWN Act is cosponsored by Reps. Robin Kelly, Yvette Clarke, Adam Schiff, Adam Smith, Adriano Espaillat, Al Green, Alma Adams, Andre Carson, Bennie G. Thompson, Bobby Scott, Colin Allred, Cori Bush, Dan Goldman, Danny K.

30,May 2,Ayanna Pressley,D,Mass.-7,"Pressley Joins Jayapal, Dean, 50+ Lawmakers Calling on Admin. to Help Prevent Assault on Rafah","May 2, 2024 Text of Letter (PDF) WASHINGTON – Today, Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) joined Representatives Pramila Jayapal (WA-07), Madeleine Dean (PA-04) and 54 additional lawmakers in calling on the Biden Administration to use all tools possible to dissuade the Israeli government from moving forward with an offensive invasion into Rafah.  “We write with urgency to say: an offensive invasion into Rafah by Israel in the upcoming days is wholly unacceptable,” wrote the Members. “Despite […] dire circumstances, the Israeli government is reportedly on the verge of a full-scale offensive on Rafah. An Israeli offensive in Rafah risks the start of yet another escalatory spiral, immediately putting the region back on the brink of a broader war that neither Israel nor the United States can afford.” Before the horrific October 7th terrorist attack by Hamas on Israel, 280,000 Palestinians lived in Rafah. Now roughly 1.4 million people are sheltering in Rafah after being displaced. This dire humanitarian situation has been exacerbated by hindered access to food, water, and medicine in the Gaza Strip. “We urge you to invoke existing law and policy to immediately withhold certain offensive military aid to the Israeli government, including aid sourced from legislation already signed into law, in order to preempt a full-scale assault on Rafah,” continued the Members. “If the Israeli government will not uphold international law and protect civilians, then the United States must act to protect innocent life. We urge you to continue your work toward achieving a lasting ceasefire that will bring hostages home and build a path toward safety and security for all.” The letter was also signed by Becca Balint (VT-At Large), Nanette Barragán (CA-44), Donald S. Beyer Jr. (VA-08), Earl Blumenauer (OR-03), Suzanne Bonamici (OR-01), Jamaal Bowman (NY-16), Cori Bush (MO-01), André Carson (IN-07), Greg Casar (TX-35), Joaquin Castro (TX-20), Judy Chu (CA-28), Gerald Connolly (VA-11), Joe Courtney (CT-02), Jasmine Crockett (TX-30), Mark DeSaulnier (CA-10), Debbie Dingell (MI-06), Lloyd Doggett (TX-37), Veronica Escobar (TX-16), Valerie Foushee (NC-04), Maxwell Frost (FL-10), Jesús G. “Chuy” García (IL-04), Sylvia Garcia (TX-29), Jimmy Gomez (CA-34), Al Green (TX-09), Raúl M.

Since the horrific October 7th attack, Congresswoman Pressley has consistently and stridently called for a bilateral ceasefire to save lives, return all hostages, and surge humanitarian aid to Gaza. Last month, Rep. Pressley delivered a floor speech in which she called for urgent de-escalation in the Middle East and renewed her calls for a ceasefire in Gaza and Israel to prevent a broader regional war. Throughout the Israel and Hamas conflict, Rep. Pressley has been a vocal and consistent advocate of diplomacy, de-escalation, and saving lives. ### Washington DC Office 402 Cannon HOB

Now roughly 1.4 million people are sheltering in Rafah after being displaced. This overcrowding has caused further suffering through scarcity of food, water, and medicine.  “We urge you to invoke existing law and policy to immediately withhold certain offensive military aid to the Israeli government, including aid sourced from legislation already signed into law, in order to preempt a full-scale assault on Rafah,” continued the Members. “If the Israeli government will not uphold international law and protect civilians, then the United States must act to protect innocent life.

I want to take a moment to discuss the critical importance of DEI work.  My colleagues across the aisle have waged an all-out war on diversity, equity, and inclusion. I am not sure if it’s that they just hate one aspect of it, like diversity, or if it’s the combination of all three.  Regardless, this Republican majority has demonstrated it’s out of touch with the priorities of everyday people and has focused its effort on passing legislation and budgets to undermine DEI and entrench systemic discrimination against people of color, folks with disabilities, and other marginalized groups. Republicans sought to defund the Office of Civil Rights in the Department of Education, which is essential to confronting the rise in antisemitism and islamophobia impacting our students.  Republicans voted to stop the hiring of DEI personnel in the military, despite evidence that it will improve military readiness. And Republicans consistently use harmful rhetoric, at every opportunity, to undermine the talent, knowledge, skills, and the training of professionals in every sector where DEI initiatives exist. And they often pervert, mischaracterize, and weaponize the words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., despite the fact that his children, his surviving children, have repeatedly asked them to cease and desist from doing so. It is no surprise that the same people complaining about DEI are the same people who complained about the Me Too movement, about Black Lives Matter, about the ERA, about the gay rights movement, and so much more.  The fact that as soon as someone who is Black or gay or has a disability earns a promotion, Republicans complain that they are unqualified and begin ranting about how diversity, equity, and inclusion is ruining the country. It’s shameful. It’s untrue. It’s discriminatory. And we must not back down in our efforts to create a nation that respects all people.   Might I add that the opposition is majority, overwhelmingly white and male. Now, President Biden signed a historic executive order on his first day in office to take a whole-of-government approach that embodies equity in the Administration’s work to ensure all people benefit, not just the wealthy and well-connected.  Mr. Miller, the Office of Management and Budget plays an outsized role in implementing and overseeing the executive orders on equity. Can you explain why equity is an important part of performance goals, performance goals, for agencies? MR. MILLER: Thank you Congresswoman, and there is a phrase that you used that is central to explaining it. It’s that government should work for all Americans.  So one example of something that we are doing is around accessibility associated with government services. We have many government digital websites and services where it’s hard for some people, including disabled individuals, to access those government services and we’re working to improve that.  Our services aren’t working if they’re not serving all of America. REP. PRESSLEY: Very good. I agree. What is an example of how President Biden’s executive order on equity has helped folks across the country? MR. MILLER: Well, one of the things that we have done is to broaden, and discussed in this hearing, the way in which we are utilizing federal financial assistance to reach more broadly into communities, to improve performance of the dollars to make sure that community-based organizations that might otherwise not have applied for federal funds are able to access those funds and better deliver because they are better — they are closer to those in their community. That means better results, that means more efficiency, and frankly, that means less waste on useless overhead. REP. PRESSLEY: Thank you. The Executive Order, this is truly a first-of-its-kind. I am proud to partner with Ranking Member Raskin on legislation to codify key aspects into law so that they will exist in perpetuity.  The truth is that America needs DEI to disrupt systems of oppression that are active in every facet of our society. DEI initiatives are how we combat white supremacy, antisemitism, ableism, sexism, transphobia, and more. In the face of the opposition, I applaud those who are committed to doing this work, from college presidents, corporate executives, to community organizers and academic researchers. And to those who are against DEI, I would love to know, really, what you are so afraid of. What are you so threatened by?  Thank you and I yield back. ### Washington DC Office 402 Cannon HOB

40,April 30,Raja Krishnamoorthi,D,Ill.-8,Xi Jinping Has Tough Economic Choices Ahead," By Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democrat from Illinois and the ranking member of the House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party. APRIL 26, 2024, 1:17 PM Click here to read the PDF version of the article. Xi Jinping, the general party secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), is in a bind. The economy of the People’s Republic of China is facing a once-in-a-generation crisis. The country’s real estate market is in free-fall, its population sank by 2 million people in 2023, and its stock markets have lost roughly $7 trillion since 2021. Numerous countries are cooperating multilaterally to take countermeasures against what they view as the CCP’s military and economic aggression. Xi’s grip on his rule is secure for the moment, but he is confronting unprecedented challenges to his leadership. Fundamentally, Xi faces a dilemma over China’s future. He and his government must decide whether to continue to prioritize increasing security and centralizing his control over the country, chilling the animal spirits of entrepreneurship in the process, or to loosen his control over the country and reduce aggression toward his neighbors, allowing for greater growth and prosperity. It is highly unlikely that he will choose the latter—and we in the United States must now begin to ready ourselves for potential challenges. Although the latest official economic statistics show China hitting its growth targets, those figures often reflect CCP narratives more than reality, and other indicators show that China’s economic state is precarious at best. Some outside analysts put China’s actual GDP growth as low as 1.5 percent in 2023. The country has lost at least $4.7 trillion in housing wealth since its market peaked in 2021. Other market indicators offer no hope for a rapid recovery, as the housing sector has just reported its worst performance ever recorded for both new and existing housing sales, while new construction has declined by a record 60 percent compared to pre-pandemic levels. After defaulting on more than $100 billion in international bonds over the past 4 years, China’s largest developers have either collapsed or survive only through government support. Injections of foreign capital have not helped to close the gap. Foreign direct investment into China is at its lowest point in three decades. China’s stock markets are down by nearly 20 percent over the past year. While stocks are relatively unimportant to Chinese household savings, public wealth is overwhelmingly tied up in real estate. Major players—such as Evergrande, Vanke, and Country Garden—are teetering on the brink of collapse as property prices continue to fall despite the government’s best efforts to prop them up. The situation could grow far worse as the country approaches a potential deflationary crisis following the largest drop in consumer prices in 15 years. All this comes as the country faces the beginning of its demographic free-fall, during which an aging Chinese population may decline by as much as 100 million people by 2050. Since the beginning of former leader Deng Xiaoping’s reform and opening, the CCP has sold China’s economic growth as a key pillar of its legitimacy. Many in the party still recognize the importance of solving these economic challenges to its legitimacy and control. One important way out is foreign direct investment. Some in the CCP are eager to court U.S. capital and reassure U.S. investors that China remains a hospitable market for doing business. At the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit last November, Xi dined with U.S. business leaders and emphasized that “China is ready to be a partner and friend of the United States, and there is plenty of room for bilateral cooperation.” However, despite Xi’s rhetoric, the actions of the Chinese government do not line up with creating a hospitable business environment for U.S. and other foreign companies. China has been steadily tightening its national security and data protection laws at the expense of businesses being able to conduct due diligence, market research, or otherwise normal operations. Earlier this year, the Chinese government broadened the scope of its state secrets law, making it even more difficult for businesses to provide information for foreign investors and stakeholders. Even more chilling is the detainment of business leaders; in 2023, many top Chinese executives from technology, finance, and real estate companies were detained or went missing. This threat is not limited to Chinese executives, as foreigners have faced exit bans. The Chinese military’s increasingly aggressive actions in Taiwan also rattle U.S.-based and other foreign businesses. The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has steadily increased incursions into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone, and in September 2023, there was a record number of PLA aircraft around Taiwanese airspace in one day. In the event of an invasion of Taiwan, the United States and other Group of Seven countries would likely impose severe economic sanctions, and estimates of the damage to the global economy are in the trillions of dollars. Companies do not want to become caught in the crossfire. Yet Xi seems willing to contemplate taking these risks for his ambition of controlling Taiwan. Xi now faces a fundamental dilemma in balancing his country’s prosperity and his party’s level of control. Despite the importance of maintaining economic growth for his popular support, Xi has consistently prioritized control ahead of his people’s prosperity. As Xi wrestles with this choice, we and others—including the Chinese people—must hope for the best while continuing to prepare for the worst.",New Democrat Coalition,"['raja krishnamoorthi democrat

41,April 26,Andy Biggs,R,Ariz.-5,Surveying Bidens Border Crisis in Lukeville and the Tohono Oodham Reservation,https://iqconnect.house.gov/iqextranet/view_newsletter.aspx?id=105788&c=AZ05AB,Freedom Party,[],
42,April 29,Bill Huizenga,R,Mich.-4,"Weekly Column: Republicans Voted to Secure the Border, Again...","The crisis along our southern border rages on because President Biden and Congressional Democrats are not taking it seriously. Throughout this Congress, I have continually fought to end President Biden’s open border policies. On May 11, 2023, I joined my House colleagues in voting to pass H.R. 2, the Secure the Border Act. This bill is the strongest border security measure to pass either chamber of Congress in modern history. This bill has been sitting on Chuck Schumer’s desk for nearly a year. On Saturday, the House had the opportunity to pass meaningful border security and sadly Democrats again rejected this measure. H.R. 3602, the End the Border Catastrophe Act, would resume border wall construction, increase the number of Border Patrol agents, reinstate the Remain in Mexico policy, and end catch-and-release policies, all very similar to provisions in H.R. 2. Additionally, this measure added language to reimburse states for costs they have incurred attempting to secure the border because the Biden Administration failed to do so. Unfortunately, while House Republicans supported this commonsense measure, the bill failed to get the two-thirds vote required to pass as a suspension. All but five Democrats voted against this effort to secure the border. Since President Biden took office, there have been 9.2 million encounters of individuals attempting to illegally enter our country with over 7.6 million of those encounters happening along our southern border. On top of that astronomical number, there have been over 1.8 million known gotaways, meaning individuals who illegally entered the U.S. and were not stopped by border patrol. Last month alone, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) recorded 189,372 encounters at the southwest border. This includes an individual from Lebanon who admitted to being a Hezbollah terrorist and having intentions of making a bomb. President Biden refuses to address this crisis, and Senate Democrats refuse to help House Republicans legislatively force his hand. Border security is a matter of national security, and we must act immediately.

43,April 25,Ayanna Pressley,D,Mass.-7,"Pressley, Markey Unveil Resolution Affirming Environmental Rights for Incarcerated People","April 25, 2024 One-Third of Federal and State Prisons Located Within Three Miles of Toxic Superfund Site  Text of Resolution (PDF) BOSTON – Following their March 29 visit to Massachusetts Correctional Institution-Norfolk, Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) and Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Clean Air, Climate, and Nuclear Safety introduced the Declaration of Environmental Rights for Incarcerated People. This resolution affirms the human right of nearly two million people currently incarcerated in the United States to a healthy and safe environment and to advocate for protecting and improving their environmental health. The resolution specifically recognizes decarceration as the principal strategy to address environmental health harms of criminal legal systems.  “Everyone has a right to clean air, water and living environment, including people who are currently incarcerated,” said Rep. Pressley. “As we work to dismantle the racist and harmful system of mass incarceration, we must confront the environmental injustices that define carceral settings and affirm the human dignity of folks behind the wall. Proud to introduce this resolution in partnership with Senator Markey, advocates, and those closest to the pain.” “Our criminal legal system’s decision to put millions of people behind bars has torn apart families, destabilized communities, and allowed others to profit from mistreating other human beings,” said Senator Markey. “As we continue to fight for decarceration, we must also give currently incarcerated people the right to a healthy and safe environment. I look forward to continuing to lift up the voices of incarcerated individuals and ensure they have opportunities to work with lawmakers to translate their lived experiences into truly effective solutions.” “For persons with lived experience, this resolution marks the beginning of connecting the intersections between carceral states of being and humanizing incarcerated populations,” said Michael L. Mauney II, African American Coalition Committee Community Outreach Director and DeeperThanWater Coalition organizer. “The passing of this resolution would symbolize an effort to eradicate the exception clause mentioned in the Thirteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Incarcerated populations support efforts to humanize us and to decarcerate and end mass incarceration.” The lawmakers’ resolution would ensure such rights as:   The resolution text was developed in partnership with the African American Coalition Committee and other incarcerated leaders at MCI-Norfolk. During Congresswoman Pressley’s and Senator Markey’s March 29 visit to the facility, incarcerated individuals shared testimonials of living through a water quality crisis that has gripped the facility since 2011.   Prisons and other carceral facilities greatly increase the exposure of incarcerated people, staff, and surrounding communities to toxic and dangerous conditions. These and other threats disproportionately harm vulnerable populations, including Black Americans, Indigenous people, Latine, and LGBTQ+ individuals, who are more likely to be incarcerated. The health impacts of incarceration are so severe that every year behind bars takes an average of two years off an individual’s life expectancy. The Declaration of Environmental Rights for Incarcerated Individuals is endorsed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the Prison Policy Initiative, Citizens United for Rehabilitation of Errants (CURE), and DeeperThanWater.  “Environmental health and safety are critically important, both for incarcerated people and for those who work, volunteer, and visit in our nation’s prisons,” said David Fathi, Director of the American Civil Liberties Union National Prison Project.  “The Resolution is an important step toward ensuring environmental justice for all.”  “We at Prison Policy Initiative strongly support a Declaration of Environmental Rights for Incarcerated People. This Declaration speaks to both the devastatingly real negative impacts of a hostile prison environment on an individual’s physical and mental health and the inalienable human right of people in prison to access clean water and air. We are proud to support this recognition of incarcerated people’s right to be free of a toxic environment,” said Sarah Staudt, Policy & Advocacy Director at the Prison Policy Initiative.  “This resolution is a step in the right direction.  It will give criminal justice agencies, especially prisons, the obligation to rehabilitate,” said Charles Sullivan, Director of CURE.  “We know that environmental injustice is one of the many things that make carceral settings toxic. Through that lens, this resolution makes clear that decarceration is the strongest and most important strategy we have to protect the rights of incarcerated people and to ensure that our communities are safe and healthy,” said Christine Mitchell, Sc.D., DeeperThanWater Coalition organizer.

44,April 29,Morgan Griffith,R,Va.-9,Congressman Griffiths Weekly E-Newsletter 4.29.24,"Recently I attended “Thunder in the Hills”, a play based off the infamous 1912 Carroll County Courthouse shootout, performed at the Courthouse.   Carroll County and the nation were rocked by the March 14, 1912 shootout. Newspapermen from all across the country flocked to the region to cover events. Until the sinking of the Titanic, this was the nation’s top story.   “The Courthouse Tragedy” emanated from a trial involving Floyd Allen, a descendant of one of the oldest families of Carroll County. Floyd had accosted a Carroll County Deputy officer attempting to turn in two of Floyd’s nephews.   Upon Allen’s conviction, bedlam erupted in the Carroll County Courthouse. Dozens of bullets flew inside the courtroom. The community and the Commonwealth could not believe what had happened.   The shootout claimed five lives, including a Judge, the Commonwealth’s Attorney and Sheriff.    Some members of the so-called “Allen Clan” were taken into custody quickly and tried. Sidna Allen and his nephew would be captured six months later in Iowa. Floyd and his son, Claude, were executed.  Sidna Allen was sentenced to thirty-five years (in 1926, he was pardoned).   To this day, people from all over Virginia and the country remain interested in the incident. Families on both sides are still sensitive about the disputed events. At the memorial service I attended in 2012, some surviving family members of those who died in this tragedy traveled to Hillsville from as far away as New England.     My connection comes from my great-grandmother of Rockbridge County.  She and her Bible study group traveled to Richmond to pray with inmates at Libby prison, including Sidna Allen.   While in prison, Sidna focused on woodworking and building furniture in order to sell items to support his family.   During my great-grandmother’s visit, she purchased a box made by Allen.  Written inside is, ‘Made by J. Sidna Allen, $5.’    My grandmother handed the box down to me a few years before she died.   Since elected to Congress, I have displayed the box in my DC office.   The Carroll County Historical Society Museum features a collection of Sidna Allen’s work: tables, treasure and jewelry boxes. His woodworking style reflected folk marquetry, creating intricate designs in his wooden objects.    As we look back on this incident, it’s important to remember that we learn little about the past by attempting to apply modern law and mores.  Romance, politics, power, and family honor all merged to become a lethal powder keg in this tragic event.   The play was extremely well done. I was mesmerized by the performance. This same group has performed “Thunder in the Hills” every few years since 2012.   They say this is it. But I for one hope they will do it again or that maybe the Barter Theatre will pick up the production in the future.   Amongst the excellent cast was my former colleague in the Virginia House of Delegates, Tom Jackson. He played Floyd Allen and was superb. After the play, he showed me both Floyd Allen’s pocket watch which he carried throughout the performance, and the lawbooks in the old courthouse’s library which belonged to Commonwealth Attorney William Foster, who was killed in the shootout, and Dexter Goad, the Circuit Court Clerk, who was injured.    I should also mention that Martha Goad was played by Cynthia Jackson, Tom’s wife, who was at Emory & Henry College while I was there. There were many outstanding performances and I do not believe I have ever seen a better cast.   As the play shows, the story has always been complicated. At Sidna Allen’s death, the Lynchburg Newspaper wrote, “The Allens have just about proved their theory of their defense.  That they were not all fundamentally bad men, but men for whom fate, in a bad hour, set a vicious stage.”    In a like manner, Carroll County is a good place that more than 100 years ago found itself thrust by fate, in a bad hour, into a vicious set of circumstances.  Let us hope that this may never occur again.   Sidna’s old house in Carroll County remains today. Located just outside Fancy Gap, the Queen Anne style house is an iconic Carroll landmark. In 1974, the house was designated for the National Register of Historic Places.   A portion of the play’s ticket sales go to the J. Sidna Allen House Restoration project. Contributions can be sent to the charitable organization at:   J. Sidna Allen Home  c/o Carroll County Historical Society and Museum  P.O. Box 937 Hillsville, VA 24343.   You may also visit carrollvamuseum.org to make an online donation via PayPal.   If you have questions, concerns, or comments, feel free to contact my office.  You can call my Abingdon office at 276-525-1405 or my Christiansburg office at 540-381-5671.  To reach my office via email, please visit my website at https://morgangriffith.house.gov.    ### Enter your email address to get the latest updates straight to your inbox.

45,April 26,Mike Quigley,D,Ill.-5,Catching Up with Quigley: Week of April 22,"Dear Friend, I hope you have had a good week. I wanted to share an update on the work I did this week while back home in our district. On Monday, I celebrated Earth Day by taking a bike ride through Arlington Heights. In March, I secured $480,000 to allow the Village of Arlington Heights to build a safe and accessible walk and bike path connecting the Palatine Trail with the Prospect Heights Trail. This connectivity will allow people to easily access destinations without the use of cars, providing them with vital physical activity and reducing their carbon footprint. Earth Day is a time to celebrate the incredible planet we live on and fight for its future. It is also reminder that the climate crisis isn't just a challenge — it's an opportunity to make investments in a cleaner future. Efforts like these are essential to encouraging people to reduce their reliance on gas powered transit, and transition to more efficient, environmentally friendly alternatives. On Thursday, I held my annual LGBTQIA+ roundtable, which hosts activists from across the Chicagoland area. It is an important chance to discuss the current state of LGBTQIA+ affairs and share some of the work I am doing to expand opportunities and strengthen protections for the LGBTQIA+ community. The event was moderated by Center on Halsted's CEO, Joli Robinson. On Thursday night, I viewed the many incredible Congressional Art Competition submissions from Illinois' 5th district. Polina Popandopulo, a student from Ridgewood High School, was declared the winner for their submission, ""Best Buddies Down on the Farm."" This piece, along with the other winning submissions from congressional districts around the country, will hang in the U.S. Capitol for the next year. Every spring, the Congressional Art Competition is an opportunity to appreciate the rich artistic talent of the young people in my district. This year’s competition was no different. From oil on canvas to photography to scratchboard— I was incredibly impressed by the potential on display. I am happy to congratulate Polina on their fine work. It will be a wonderful representation of our district's talent for the thousands of visitors to our Capitol from around the world. Don't forget, our office is always here to help. You can call my DC office at (202) 225-4061 or my Chicago office at (773) 267-5926. You can also email me through my website at Quigley.house.gov/contact.

48,April 24,Andy Biggs,R,Ariz.-5,Washington Times: Speaker Johnson's Foreign Aid Bill is a Disaster,"Washington Times America continues to fund both sides of conflicts and wars. This is typified by the latest Israel aid portion of the package voted on by the House of Representatives. Almost half of the Israel aid package goes to “humanitarian” purposes, with deference to how to distribute the $9 billion left in the hands of the Biden administration — yes, the same Biden administration that has taken the position of the “two-state solution.” That is to say, President Biden, who is kneeling to the base of the Democratic Party, which exclaims, “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,” has arranged for up to $9 billion to be sent to Gaza. The same Gaza that has been controlled by Hamas for more than a decade. The same Gaza that is ostensibly governed by the Palestinian Authority, which has honored and given bounties to suicide bombers who have indiscriminately killed Israeli civilians. Up to $9 billion to the same Gaza that has acknowledged that Hamas has been hijacking most, if not all, of the humanitarian aid that Israel has facilitated. That Hamas. The Hamas that steals food and medicine and converts it into use for the terrorists while starving the people in Gaza. We, the House of Representatives, voted to give upward of $9 billion to Gaza/Hamas, which takes the pressure off of Iran, which has been financially supporting Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and other terrorist organizations. The package passed in the Senate on Tuesday and will be signed by the president this week. Who will determine the distribution of the funds? None other than the hapless Biden regime. The same regime that insists that Israel recognize the right of statehood of an area that houses the soulless, ruthless terrorists of Hamas. The Hamas terrorists who have sworn to annihilate Israel. The Biden regime, now captured by antisemitic radicals who want the genocidal eradication of Israel, insists that Israel engage in a one-sided cease-fire. It has demanded that Israel stop attacking Hamas animals and let Hamas regroup. Israel has offered a cease-fire seven times, but Hamas refuses because Israel demands that Hamas (which broke a cease-fire when it barbarically attacked Israel on Oct. 7) also lay down its weapons. Even the funding that goes to Israel in the aid package will be leveraged, directed and controlled to a large extent by the Biden regime. Thank goodness that the ongoing, annualized payment of more than $3 billion, which has been on autopilot since 2018, is in the process of delivery, as it has fewer Biden strings. Does Israel need help? Of course. That is why the best thing that House Speaker Mike Johnson has done was to push a package that provided military and humanitarian aid to Israel last November. Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer and Mr. Biden opposed that package because it was paid for instead of being tacked onto our national debt. The need to help Israel is also why additional legislation was proposed, including my bill HR 7271. The speaker failed to move on that bill because, he said, “The Senate won’t pass it.” So, the Schumer-Biden cabal, which refused to pass and sign into law an aid package that passed out of the House on a bipartisan vote last November, insisted that its proposal, which appeases the Democrats’ antisemitic base, be brought forward instead. The Schumer-Biden cabal also demanded that the entire Senate package of aid to Ukraine ($61 billion), Israel ($23 billion) and Taiwan ($2.5 billion) be passed. And so, it was. And that’s how we end up funding both sides of the Israel-Hamas war. Democrats refuse to supply aid to Israel unless four things happen: (1) There cannot be a pay-for; the cost of the aid must be added to our national debt; (2) No funding for Israel unless Ukraine also gets funded; (3) To appease the antisemitic Democratic base, there has to be money going to Gaza-Hamas and (4) There cannot be U.S. border security policy tied to the Ukraine funding, contrary to what Mr. Johnson promised privately and publicly, dozens of times. Last word. For at least three reasons, we know that assistance for Ukraine, not Israel, was the main objective for Democrats, who continue to kneel to their antisemitic base: (1) It was the Ukrainian flag that Democrats were waving on the floor after the vote last Saturday, not the Israeli flag; (2) Democrat Gerry Connolly brazenly claimed “the Ukrainian-Russian border is our border” without mention of the need to protect our true own border or Israel’s border and (3) while almost half of the Israel funding will likely be used to refurbish and rearm Hamas, there is no demand that nearly half of the Ukraine aid goes to the enemy who brutally attacked and continues to fight Ukraine. If the first Israel aid package of last November was the best thing Mr. Johnson has done, this last legislation (which came to the House as one bill and returned to the Senate as one bill, not four separate bills) is one of the worst.

49,April 25,Ayanna Pressley,D,Mass.-7,Rep. Pressleys Statement on Peaceful Student Protests,"April 25, 2024 BOSTON – Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) issued the following statement on peaceful student protests. “Peaceful protest is a central tenet of our democracy and students standing for justice have often been a catalyst for much-needed change. From the 1960s civil rights movement, the Vietnam War protests, the struggle for gender equality, and the movement for Black lives, to the global movement for peace in Israel and Palestine, many of the rights we tout today were earned thanks to the sweat equity of students demonstrating on college campuses across the nation. “Every student, regardless of background or faith, has a right to feel safe and show up in the world without fear or discrimination — and we must ensure that those exercising their right to free speech are met with dignity and respect, not criminalization. “That is why I am deeply concerned about misinformation that aims to undermine this movement, outside agitators that detract from peaceful solidarity actions, and the aggressive response by law enforcement to students peacefully protesting across the country. The National Guard or riot police should not be called in response to students’ peaceful freedom of expression. Let me be clear: we absolutely should not repeat the mistakes of generations past, and history has its eyes on us.  “I call on university administrators to ensure that there are no academic repercussions for peaceful student protestors, and I urge law enforcement — at all levels of government — to exercise restraint. Safety for all students must be the priority. “I am grateful to students nationwide and across the Massachusetts 7th — at Emerson, Northeastern, MIT, Tufts, Boston University, Harvard, and more — who are raising their voices and putting their bodies on the line to press for action to save lives in Gaza. That is what this movement is about. We cannot lose sight of the horrific injustices that Palestinians in Gaza are facing and I am proud to stand in solidarity with peaceful protestors.  “My office is monitoring the situation at campuses in our district and I will continue pushing federally for a lasting bilateral ceasefire in Gaza to save lives, return the hostages, and deliver much-needed humanitarian aid to the region. From Massachusetts to the Middle East, our destinies are tied.” Since the horrific October 7th attack, Congresswoman Pressley has consistently and stridently called for a ceasefire to save lives, return all hostages, and surge humanitarian aid to Gaza. Last week, Rep. Pressley delivered a floor speech in which she called for urgent de-escalation in the Middle East and renewed her calls for a ceasefire in Gaza to prevent a broader regional war. Throughout the Israel and Hamas conflict, Rep. Pressley has been a vocal and consistent advocate of diplomacy, de-escalation, and saving lives. ### Washington DC Office 402 Cannon HOB

50,April 25,Pramila Jayapal,D,Wash.-7,Jayapal Announces $16 Million in Funding for the Northwest Seaport Alliance,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Representative Pramila Jayapal (WA-07) is today announcing that she helped to secure $16 million for the Northwest Seaport Alliance (NWSA) from the Federal Highway Administration to deploy 36-58 zero-emission drayage trucks through vehicle purchases and development of charging/fueling infrastructure in the Seattle-Tacoma region.  “Washington’s ports are vital to our economy, our supply chains, and our way of life here in Seattle.  Ensuring these charging hubs are fully funded and given the resources needed to build and maintain clean energy infrastructure will protect our environment, our communities, and our economy,” said Jayapal. “This project will ensure that our cargo hauling services are modernized and will also drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions which disproportionately damage the air quality of communities near our seaports and along major freight corridors.” “The Northwest Seaport Alliance is deeply grateful to Congresswoman Jayapal for her leadership in helping secure $16 million in funding from the Federal Highway Administration’s Reduction of Truck Emissions at Port Facilities Grant Program,” said Kristin Ang, Port of Tacoma Commission President and The Northwest Seaport Alliance Co-Chair. “These funds will be instrumental in advancing our Zero-Emission Drayage Truck Incentive Program and accelerating the transition to zero-emission drayage trucks in the Puget Sound.” “The Managing Members of The Northwest Seaport Alliance have introduced bold policies aimed at eliminating seaport-related Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2040, and Scope 3 emissions by 2050 or sooner,” said Hamdi Mohamed, Port of Seattle Commission President and The Northwest Seaport Alliance Co-Chair. “Securing grant funding from programs like the Reduction of Truck Emissions at Port Facilities is critical to the successful transition to zero emissions operations for truck drivers. These funds will also support the network of charging infrastructure needed by truck drivers across the region.” This grant is a further step toward the transition to clean energy at the Port of Seattle. The effort to create the charging infrastructure for a zero-emission drayage fleet will help to reduce diesel particulate emissions in near-port communities experiencing significant health disparities and support the vitality of regional manufacturing and industrial centers and many small and medium-sized businesses. This project will benefit near-port communities such as the Duwamish Valley, South Park, and Georgetown and port workers by reducing the health impacts associated with diesel exhaust. Children who live in the Duwamish Valley have among the highest rates of hospitalization due to asthma compared with any other neighborhood in Seattle and life expectancy in Georgetown and South Park is eight years shorter than the city’s average. This funding is in addition to the $850,000 Jayapal secured for the program in the 2024 federal budget. Jayapal also supporteda $12 million investment to support this project from the newly established Federal Zero-Emission Charging and Infrastructure Grant Program.

EPA is using the cumulative impact of a suite of rules – a so-called ‘Clean Power Plan 2.0.’ EPA’s rules will accelerate coal plant retirements when our grid reliability and the affordability of the nation’s power supply demand just the opposite. EPA’s refusal to heed the warnings of the experts tasked with keeping the lights on and ensuring a reliable supply of power is alarming and will likely have negative consequences for millions of Americans,” said the Congressional Coal Caucus Co-Chairs.  The Congressional Coal Caucus is the voice of American coal communities in Congress.

54,April 12,Mike Quigley,D,Ill.-5,Catching Up with Quigley: Week of April 8,"Dear Friend, I hope you have had a good week. I wanted to take a moment to share a quick overview of some of the work I did this week while in Washington. On Thursday, I sat down with the Governor of Maryland, Wes Moore, to discuss the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore. On March 26, the bridge was hit by a cargo ship, resulting in the death of six bridge workers and a pause in all commercial movement into the port. The Key Bridge, for many, is a lifeline. It connects the people of Baltimore to jobs, ensures U.S. automobile makers expand the footprint of American made vehicles, and is a hub for agricultural exchange. Roughly 30,000 vehicles travel across the Baltimore Key Bridge on any given day, including commuters, long-distance travelers and those carrying goods to-and-from the Port of Baltimore. It is clear that rebuilding this bridge is critical to not just the people of Maryland, but for our economy as a whole. In my role as the lead Democrat on the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Subcommittee, I assured Governor Moore that a timely and efficient rebuild is top of mind. We further discussed how the state and the federal government can work in unison and what next steps are necessary to get this done. On Wednesday, I had the honor of welcoming Chicagoland veterans to Washington, D.C. in partnership with Honor Flight Chicago. Honor Flight is an organization that sponsors a trip to D.C. for World War II, Vietnam and Korean War veterans so that they can visit their respective memorials. Each time I meet with these brave veterans, I am inspired by the stories of their service and sacrifice. It is because of those sacrifices that we can enjoy our freedoms. I was honored to meet with them this past week and offer my sincerest appreciation for their courage and devotion to our country.  Last week, I embarked on a trip to Poland and Ukraine to meet with high-level officials and learn more about how Ukrainian forces are faring against Putin's army. This trip included members of Congress from both sides of the aisle and reaffirmed my belief that supporting Ukraine is not a partisan issue—it is an American one. Therefore on Wednesday, I joined my Republican colleague on BBC News to discuss what we learned from our meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and what must be done in Congress to ensure a Ukrainian victory.

Cuellar's Bill to Rename Laredo Post Office After Fallen Servicemembers Heads to Presidents Desk,"Today, U.S. Congressman Henry Cuellar, Ph.D. (TX-28) celebrated the Senate passage of his bill renaming the Del Mar Post Office in Laredo after local, fallen military heroes Lance Corporal David Lee Espinoza, Lance Corporal Juan Rodrigo Rodriguez, and Sergeant Roberto Arizola, Jr. The legislation now heads to the President’s Desk, where it will be signed into law. “Lance Corporal David Lee Espinoza, Lance Corporal Juan Rodrigo Rodriguez, and Sergeant Roberto Arizola, Jr. paid the ultimate sacrifice in preserving our freedom, and renaming the Del Mar Post Office here in Laredo will forever commemorate their selfless efforts,” said Dr. Cuellar. “Yesterday, the Senate unanimously voted to memorialize these South Texas heroes and ensure their legacy lives on. Thank you to Texas Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz for working with me to get this legislation through the Senate and the entire Texas Congressional delegation for cosponsoring the bill.” “When my son, David, was killed in Kabul in August 2021, Congressman Cuellar immediately reached out to our family to see how he could help. Not only did we receive his full emotional support, he also helped us get a home where David’s brothers and sister could grow up,” said Elizabeth Holguin, mother of Lance Corporal David Lee Espinoza. “Nothing will ever bring my son back. However, my family and I are honored to have the post office display David’s name in his honor. Thank you, Congressman Cuellar, for passing this bill to honor David's memory.” ""My family and I thank Congressman Cuellar for passing this bill for my brother. It is a great honor knowing his name will forever be remembered as a hero,” said Ricardo Arizola, brother of Sergeant Roberto Arizola, Jr.                      “My son was a selfless human being who lived to serve others and his community. After his military term was up, he wanted to come home and join the local police department,” said Juana Maria Rodriguez, mother of Lance Corporal Juan Rodrigo Rodriguez. “May this post office now embody my son’s values of honor, service, and sense of duty. Thank you, Congressman Cuellar, for helping us pay tribute to Juan’s ultimate sacrifice.” Lance Corporal David Lee Espinoza was born on July 10, 2001, in Laredo, Texas, but lived in nearby Rio Bravo, Texas, all his life. He graduated from Lyndon B. Johnson High School in 2019. Shortly after graduating, he joined the United States Marine Corps. On August 26, 2021, during the withdrawal from Afghanistan, Lance Corporal Espinoza was one of 13 service members killed by a suicide bombing in Kabul, Afghanistan. He was 20 years old. Lance Corporal Juan Rodrigo Rodriguez lived in El Cenizo, a town near Laredo, where he attended United South High School and was involved in Junior ROTC. He led his group to a Junior RTOC national championship in 1998. After graduating high school in 2000, he joined the United States Marine Forces Reserves. He was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 23rd Marine Regiment, 4th Division, Corpus Christi, Texas. On January 13, 2005, Lance Corporal Rodriguez died in action while conducting combat operations in Anbar Province, Iraq. He was 23 years old. Sergeant Roberto Arizola, Jr. was born in Laredo, Texas, on December 11, 1973. He graduated high school in 1992 and enlisted in the United States Army in 1996. He was assigned to the 297th Military Intelligence Battalion, 513th Military Intelligence Brigade, Fort Gordon, Georgia. Sgt. Arizola had been a border patrol agent in Laredo before being deployed to Iraq in May 2004. His family delayed their son’s birthday party so Sgt. Arizola could attend when he returned, but on June 8, 2005, a day before he was scheduled to return from Iraq, Sgt. Arizola was killed in an explosion near his vehicle in Baghdad, Iraq. He was 31 years old. Dr. Cuellar introduced H.R. 2754 earlier this year to designate the United States Postal Service facility at 2395 East Del Mar Boulevard in Laredo, Texas, as the Lance Corporal David Lee Espinoza, Lance Corporal Juan Rodrigo Rodriguez & Sergeant Roberto Arizola Jr. Post Office Building. A ceremony will be held at a later date to commemorate the name change and honor the Gold Star families.

56,April 8,Bill Huizenga,R,Mich.-4,Weekly Column: Good Jobs and Lower Energy Costs," Last week, the Palisades Nuclear Power Plant in Covert received a $1.52 billion conditional loan commitment from the Department of Energy to restart operations in 2025. This is great news! I’ve led the bipartisan charge in Congress behind this historic project because it will bring economic opportunity, lower energy costs, and greater energy security for Southwest Michigan.  Repowering Palisades means bringing 800 megawatts of safe, reliable, carbon-free energy generation for more than 800,000 homes - and hundreds of highly skilled, good-paying jobs right here to Michigan’s Fourth Congressional District.  According to Market Van Buren’s Zach Morris, “we’re getting back $259 million of economic impact in our local economy, regionally.” That’s one of the many reasons I, the federal government, the State of Michigan, local officials, chambers of commerce, labor unions, environmental groups, and many others came together in support of this project.  For our nation, this federal investment marks an important milestone. Palisades could be the first-ever recommissioning of a nuclear power plant – a key step in regaining American energy security and independence. The plant’s owner, Holtec International, is also planning to build two industry-first small modular reactor (SMR) units at the site which have the innovative potential to generate even more reliable carbon-free energy.  Leading up to the announcement, I’ve been advocating to position Southwest Michigan at the forefront of our nation’s lower-cost, safe, and reliable energy future. I’m proud to have led the bipartisan congressional letter for a safe and swift review of the loan application that was approved last week.  I’ve been highly engaged at the federal level on this critical issue by pressing the Biden Administration on restarting Palisades, supporting the power purchase agreement with Wolverine Power Cooperative, and visiting Holtec’s innovative manufacturing and research facility to see work being done for Palisades first-hand.   These steps are in addition to discussing how repowering the plant furthers my mission of making our area an even better place to live, work, and raise a family.

57,April 15,Bill Huizenga,R,Mich.-4,Weekly Column: Reining in the Tax Man," April 15th is one of the most loathsome days for Americans: Tax Day. Last Congress, the Democrat Majority and President Biden increased funding for the IRS by roughly $72 billion. This included funding to hire over 87,000 IRS agents with a focus on so-called rich Americans. However, when you look past the window dressing, it’s clear the IRS is still targeting middle-class Americans at an alarming pace.  As of last summer, 63% of new audits have targeted individuals making under $200,000, according to a recent report from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. This report also highlights that despite billions in funding, and a hiring goal of 3,700 to go after the so-called wealthy, the IRS has only hired a whopping 34 people during the first six months.  Already, the IRS hasn’t even been able to execute its top-line objectives, which is consistent with analysis from the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation showing that most of the tax revenue raised from these new agents would come from lower- and middle-income earners. This is why I voted to cut funding for the 87,000 IRS agents and claw back the ridiculously bloated IRS budget. You should be able to keep more of your hard-earned money, not send it to Washington so the IRS can then target you.   Remember, last year, the federal government collected $4.4 trillion in revenue. Washington doesn’t have a revenue problem; it has a spending problem. I do not want the Biden Administration’s IRS targeting middle-class families and small businesses across Van Buren and Berrien counties. I am committed to protecting Americans from governmental overreach and I will continue to battle bureaucrats in Washington over the proper size, role, and scope of the federal government.  My office has helped hundreds of individuals, families, and businesses across Southwest Michigan with issues related to the IRS. We are here to serve you.

59,April 22,Bill Huizenga,R,Mich.-4,"Weekly Column: Standing with Israel, Holding Iran Accountable"," Over the weekend, Iran launched a direct assault against Israel. I continue to stand with Israel, and completely condemn the actions of Iran.  Iran remains one of the most heavily sanctioned countries in the world. However, as recent as March 2024, the Biden Administration granted sanction waivers to Iran, potentially giving the regime access to billions of dollars. We cannot provide a financial lifeline to the Iranian regime as it continues to support terrorist organizations around the world and now directly attacks our allies.  My bill, the No U.S. Financing for Iran Act, was one of the first considered in the House to hold Iran accountable as well as limit the Iranian regime’s ability to finance terrorism. I am proud to say that H.R. 5921 passed the House with a bipartisan vote of 294-105.  The No U.S. Financing for Iran Act protects our national security interests in three main ways.  First, it prohibits Treasury from issuing licenses that allow U.S. financial institutions to enable trade with Iran.  Second, it further cuts off financing for Iran from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). While Iran is not currently seeking assistance from the Fund, it certainly could as an IMF member country. My bill makes clear that the United States, as the IMF’s largest shareholder, will oppose any such request. This prohibition would extend to the IMF Special Drawing Rights program, which Iran utilized in 2021 to access approximately $5 billion.  Lastly, it extends an existing prohibition against Export-Import Bank financing for Iran.  My bill is targeted. It tightens our grip on the Ayatollahs while permitting licenses to allow for humanitarian aid to continue flowing to the Iranian people.  When Americans deposit their earnings in a U.S. bank or entrust the government with their tax dollars, they do so assuming that the money will not be used in ways that undermine the security of our nation. These are commonsense but long overdue prohibitions to hold the Iranian regime accountable.

60,April 24,Nanette Barragán,D,Calif.-44,UCLA Newsroom:,"Eminent policymakers and scholars address today’s law and policy challenges By Cristian Rivera January 29, 2024 By 2050, Latinas are expected to make up 13% of the U.S. population, account for 11% of the labor force, and have a median age 11 years younger than their white counterparts. Yet Latinas comprise only 2.5% of all U.S. lawyers, account for less than 1% of all partners in law firms and have never served on the highest court in 44 states. To address this alarming gap in Latina representation and leadership in law and policy, the UCLA Latino Policy and Politics Institute, the Latina Futures, 2050 Lab, the Latina Lawyers Bar Association, and the UCLA Chicanx Latinx Law Review hosted the inaugural Latina Futures: Transforming the Nation Through Law and Policy symposium.  The sold-out event, which took place Jan. 20 and 21 at UCLA’s Luskin Conference Center, brought together nearly 400 prominent Latina scholars, attorneys, politicians, policy leaders and students from across the country to explore today’s legal and advocacy challenges and opportunities through a Latina lens. “This weekend, we are replacing the status quo with forward-thinking, accurate, and necessary contributions from Latina leaders now and well into the future,” said Sonja Diaz, founding executive director of the Latino Policy and Politics Institute and co-founder of Latina Futures, 2050 Lab, in her opening remarks.   The event featured 11 panels and plenary sessions, two fireside chats, a keynote and networking opportunities that touched on a variety of topics, including affirmative action and reproductive justice, the intersectionality of Latina and LGBTQ+ identities, and avenues toward advancing legal and policy reforms that promote equality and inclusion. Participants shared personal and professional experiences that highlighted the need to increase the representation of Latina leaders in decision-making positions. Among the symposium’s 70 speakers was California Chief Justice Patricia Guerrero, the first Latina in this role, who spoke about her journey from the Imperial Valley and the challenges she overcame.  In a fireside chat moderated by Margaret Salazar-Porzio, Mary Murguía, chief judge of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and her sister Janet Murguía, CEO and president of the civil rights and advocacy nonprofit UnidosUS, delved into their paths towards leadership and the hope they have for future leaders to unite Latino communities and the nation in an increasingly divided world. U.S. Rep. Nanette Barragán, a UCLA alumna from the class of 2000, California state Sen. María Elena Durazo, New Mexico state Sen. Antoinette Sedillo-Lopez, and Texas state Rep. Maria Luisa Flores shared their perspectives with Laura Gómez, a professor at UCLA School of Law, on the need for a Latina lens in policymaking across all levels of government. In addition, Vilma Martinez, U.S. ambassador to Argentina and former president and general counsel of MALDEF, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, challenged attendees to take ownership of the future and contribute to a more inclusive and equitable society.  Reflecting on the 50-year anniversary of MALDEF, Martinez told the audience during the program that she felt an initial sense of disappointment because she thought the organization’s work would have been completed by this time. However, she continued, her feelings shifted with her recognition that our nation is built on grand aspirations and ideals — and achieving them is a long and continuous process. Professor Veronica Terriquez, director of UCLA’s Chicano Studies Research Center and co-founder of the Latina Futures, 2050 Lab – shared her vision for the future.  “Together, we will tackle the most pressing social problems by taking an intersectional approach to our work.  We must proceed in ways that are mindful of the diversity of our communities and inclusive of the voices of those often marginalized,” she said. “ We have the potential to inform social, political, and economic changes that benefit the majority of this nation.” Terriquez expressed her hope that the symposium would inspire participants to continue their advocacy and leadership. “I hope you feel energized from this weekend and will continue to fight for our communities,” she told the audience. “This is a long game, and it builds on the work that came before us.”  Stay up-to-date on District 44's latest news, updates and more!

61,April 24,Nanette Barragán,D,Calif.-44,"Long Beach Press-Telegram: WomenShelter Long Beach gets $850,000 in federal funding for transitional housing project","By KRISTY HUTCHINGS | khutchings@scng.com PUBLISHED: April 23, 2024 at 2:42 p.m. | UPDATED: April 23, 2024 at 2:43 p.m. WomenShelter Long Beach, a nonprofit serving survivors of domestic violence, will soon build a new transitional housing facility for its clients — with help from a significant chunk of federal funding. Rep. Nanette Diaz Barragán, who represents California’s 44th Congressional District, helped secure $850,000 for the nonprofit’s project. Congress members, during the 2024 fiscal year, were able to submit funding requests to the U.S. House of Representative’s Appropriations Committee for up to 15 community projects within their districts. “We’re looking forward to seeing how the money can make a difference to women and domestic violence survivors in the Long Beach area,” Barragán said in a Monday, April 22, interview. “Our focus was housing women, women empowerment and, of course, breaking the cycle — so this was an easy project to fund.” Barragán presented WomenShelter Long Beach and its various leaders with the $850,000 check during a Monday ceremony. WomenShelter Long Beach will use the funding to purchase and retrofit an existing house or apartment building, which will serve as a transitional housing facility for the nonprofit’s clients. The organization has provided crucial services for women and children since its establishment in 1977 — and offers a comprehensive suite of services for domestic violence survivors, including safe housing, emergency shelter, a 24-hour crisis hotline, counseling, legal advocacy and more. WomenShelter has yet to select a site for the new facility, according to Lisette Flores, the nonprofit’s board president. The location, when selected, won’t be shared publicly to protect future residents, Flores said in a Monday interview. “It could be in the flavor of a home, like what we have now,” Flores said, referencing WSLB’s existing emergency supportive housing shelter. “Or it could be like an apartment building where everyone has their own personal space.” Ideally, according to WomenShelter’s director of development, Nicholas Maddox, the new facility will have six to eight units — which could house multiple people, such a women and their children, to a single room. There isn’t a precise timeline for buying, retrofitting and opening the new facility, Flores said, though the goal is to have the project finished in the next six months to a year. Once open, clients will be able to live in the transitional housing facility for up to a year and the’ll also have access to case management, therapy and employment services. “I can personally say that the services and the work that our advocates do every single day makes a huge impact in everyone’s lives,” Jennifer Costa, WSLB’s director of outreach and education, said Monday. “Knowing that this continued support will be provided — it’s tremendous.” If you or someone you know is experiencing domestic violence, help is available 24/7 through the National Domestic Violence Hotline.

63,April 23,Pramila Jayapal,D,Wash.-7,"Jayapal, Murphy, Warren, Peters Lead Senate And House Colleagues In Urging FTC To Swiftly Finalize Rule Banning Non-Compete Agreements","WASHINGTON – U.S. Representatives Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and Scott Peters (D-Calif.) and U.S. Senators Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on Tuesday led 14 of their Senate and House colleagues in sending a letter to Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chair Lina Khan urging the FTC to finalize a proposed rule to ban non-compete agreements as soon as possible. In their letter, the members illustrated the myriad harmful effects of non-compete agreements on both workers and the economy and highlighted the anticipated benefits of the FTC’s rule. U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and U.S. Representatives Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), Dwight Evans (D-Pa.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), Greg Casar (D-Texas), Lizzie Fletcher (D-Texas), Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.), Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) and Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) also signed the letter. “The negative effects of non-compete agreements are widespread and pervasive across all sectors of the economy,” the members wrote. “While some special interests would have one believe non-compete agreements are essential tools for protecting sensitive business information and only affect a small handful of well-placed boardroom executives, the evidence paints a different picture. A staggering 30 million workers in the United States are bound by non-competes – a figure that represents roughly 20 percent of the American workforce. In many instances, non-competes are applied to low-wage workers even though, according to a GAO report, businesses admit these workers do not have access to confidential business information. Studies have shown that among workplaces that pay their employees an average of $13, nearly 30% of them apply non-compete agreements to their workers. For employers who are worried about their sensitive business information, other options exist. Non-disclosure agreements, for example, could be used to prevent employees from disclosing business information to their new employer.” The members continued: “To make matters worse, workers from historically marginalized communities are often the most impacted by non-compete agreements. Research suggests that non-compete clauses lower earnings for female and nonwhite workers and that workers with less education experience greater wage loss from non-competes. Non-compete agreements have also been shown to slow innovation and hamper economic dynamism. In the last 40 years, startup growth in the United States has slowed. Research has shown that non-compete agreements reduce firm entry and spinout rates, and that firms founded in states where these agreements are in effect, are more likely to fail than those in states where non-competes are banned.” The members concluded, voicing their support for the FTC’s rule and calling for its swift finalization: “We are pleased that the FTC is taking this much-needed step to protect workers across the country. The proposed Non-competes Clause Rule will help ensure American workers enjoy the freedom to change jobs when they want and remain free from the interference and intimidation that often comes with a non-compete agreement. In addition, the proposed rule would give employers the freedom to compete for talent, which is an essential component of a vibrant and robust job marketplace. Our economy and our country do best when wages increase, and workers can compete for better jobs and better wages. The FTC’s rule on non-compete agreements will bring a welcome change for workers across the country, and we encourage you to finalize it as soon as possible.” Read the full letter HERE.

64,April 19,Mike Quigley,D,Ill.-5,Catching Up With Quigley: Week of April 15,"Dear Friend, I hope you have had a good week. I wanted to take a moment to share an update on the work I did this week while in Washington. 1. Hosted Mothers of American Veterans Killed in Action in Ukraine
  This week, as co-chair of the Congressional Ukraine Caucus, I hosted a press conference with three Gold Star mothers of American veterans killed while fighting in Ukraine. These mothers shared their son's stories, explained why they chose to join Ukraine's cause, and made the case for sending additional assistance. These veterans made the ultimate sacrifice to fight for Ukraine's freedom. I believe we must honor their service by helping Ukraine end this war. I was joined by colleagues from both sides of the aisle at the press conference and we made clear our determination to protect Ukraine and the rest of Eastern Europe from Putin's threats.  I recently returned from my third trip to Ukraine since the war began in February 2022. I met with President Zelenskyy and high-ranking military officials who offered insight into the need for further assistance to defend against Russia. 2. Held a Roundtable on Improving Transparency in Government
  On Tuesday, I hosted a roundtable discussion with speakers from a variety of government offices and civil society organizations to identify actionable commitments that advance transparency and bring sunshine to our government. Here in Congress, I am proud to serve as a co-chair and co-founder of the bipartisan Congressional Transparency Caucus. Transparency in government is crucial to our democracy. Our government derives its power from the consent of the governed, and openness and accessibility of government information is essential in establishing public trust and accountability. 3. Joined CNN to Discuss the State of Play in Congress  On Tuesday, I joined CNN MAX with Jim Sciutto to discuss Speaker Johnson's plan to respond to the crises unfolding beyond our borders. After months of delay, the Speaker unveiled his plan to provide critical aid to Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan. As the United States, I believe it is imperative that we lead the fight to save democracy and stand up to tyranny. We also discussed threats from far-right conservatives to remove Johnson as Speaker of the House. I emphasized the importance of focusing on the tasks at hand rather than wasting time with partisan theater. To watch my full interview, click HERE. Don't forget, our office is always here to help.

65,April 22,Ayanna Pressley,D,Mass.-7,"Pressley, Warren Celebrate $1M Secured for Black Economic Council of Massachusetts","April 22, 2024 Critical Funds Will Aid BECMA’s Efforts to Support Small Black-Owned Business and Black Entrepreneurs Photos (Dropbox) | Video (YouTube) BOSTON – Today, Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) and Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) visited Nubian Square in Roxbury for a roundtable discussion to celebrate the $1,000,000 million in federal funding they secured for the Black Economic Council of Massachusetts (BECMA). The funding will help BECMA’s efforts to support small Black-owned businesses and Black entrepreneurs through technical assistance and other tools and services. “For generations, Black families have been systematically denied the opportunity to build wealth, and this precise, intentional federal investment in our Black small business owners and entrepreneurs will help us close the glaring racial wealth gap right here in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts” said Rep. Pressley. “As representative for one of the most unequal districts in this country, I am proud to have secured this robust funding alongside my colleague Senator Warren to help our communities thrive.” “BECMA’s work to help address the Black wealth gap in the Commonwealth is powerfully important, and this federal funding that Rep. Ayanna Pressley, Senator Markey and I helped secure is one of the best ways we can continue to support BECMA’s crucial mission of supporting Black-owned businesses,” said Sen. Warren. “I was delighted to celebrate this funding today and I’m going to keep fighting for federal investments and efforts to help close the Black wealth gap.” Congresswoman Pressley and Senator Warren were joined at the roundtable by BECMA President Nicole Obi and Black small business owners supported by BECMA’s Back Office Support Services (BOSS) program. “The Black Economic Council of Massachusetts is thankful for Congresswoman Pressley and Senator Warren’s leadership in securing BECMA $1 million in federal funding to help us continue our work to build and sustain Black wealth across the Commonwealth,” said Nicole Obi, President and CEO at the Black Economic Council of Massachusetts. “This critical funding supports BECMA’s Back Office Support Services (BOSS) program, which provides our members with access to working capital grants, digital tools, and professional services to help them launch and scale their firms.” “We are so grateful to Congresswoman Pressley and Senator Warren for prioritizing support for small, diverse businesses like ours,” said Denise O’Marde, Owner of Cafe Juice Up in Mattapan. “We are also deeply appreciative to our BECMA family for providing us access to the critical resources and services that help us stabilize our operations and thrive.” “Thank you to Congresswoman Pressley and Senator Warren for advocating for organizations like BECMA that support Black-owned businesses,” said Shana Bryant, Founder and CEO of Shana Bryant Consulting. “BECMA has provided invaluable support to my firm that expanded our HR infrastructure and capacity, including a $10,000 BOSS grant that helped to cover the interest for a financing loan.” “Thank you to BECMA for providing support for my business at a critical time and to Rep. Pressley and Senator Warren for their leadership,” said Abdllahi “Mash” Abdirahman, Founder and Owner of Butterfly Falafel. “I encourage them to continue to prioritize diversity, equity, and inclusion in their work and to ensure that federal funding reaches Black businesses and communities directly.” Footage from the roundtable and press conference can be found here, and photos are here. Rep. Pressley secured the federal funding for the program in the Fiscal Year 2023 government spending package that passed Congress and was signed into law by President Biden in December 2022. Rep. Pressley has secured approximately $35 million in federal community project funding for the Massachusetts 7th since Fiscal Year 2022. ### Washington DC Office 402 Cannon HOB

66,April 22,Henry Cuellar,D,Tex.-28,"Rep. Cuellar Announces $3,120,000 in Federal Funds for Schoolyard Forestry in Laredo","Today, Congressman Henry Cuellar, Ph.D. (TX-28) announced $3,120,000 in federal funds for schoolyard forestry in Laredo. The funds, awarded by the Texas A&M Forestry Service, were made possible by the Inflation Reduction Act, which Dr. Cuellar helped pass in 2022. “Quality campus amenities encourage a positive learning environment for our students. The funds announced today for the Adelante con Arboles project will deliver a unique urban forestry solution for Laredo students as they learn more about the natural wonders of our world,” said Dr. Cuellar. “I applaud the Texas A&M Forest Service for utilizing federal dollars made available through the Inflation Reduction Act to invest in South Texas. Thank you to Dr. Sylvia Guerra Rios, Superintendent of LISD, and Tricia Cortez, Executive Director of RGISC, for working with me to secure these funds for Laredo students.” “Beyond beautifying our schools, these trees will play an important role in making our campuses feel more welcoming and attractive,” stated LISD Superintendent of Schools Dr. Sylvia G. Rios. “Our students will watch these trees grow and connect them to their fond memories of their educational experience at LISD.” “More importantly, these trees will also serve as useful tools to teach our students about the world around them and the importance as well as responsibility we all share in nurturing our environment,” Dr. Rios exclaimed. “We are so grateful to be the recipients of such a generous grant, and as such, we are committed to working alongside our community partners to positively impact the world in which we live,” reiterated Dr. Rios. “This is a special day for such an announcement; not only is it taking place on Earth Day, but it represents a new step forward for our South Texas border city. This Laredo project was one of only five selected from across Texas, and it speaks to the commitment of our community to increase native tree canopy at Laredo ISD, provide outdoor learning opportunities for students, and begin to address climate change and severe urban heat island in the inner city,” said Tricia Cortez, Executive Director of RGISC. This award will help the Laredo Independent School District (LISD) and Rio Grande International Study Center (RGISC) implement their Adelante con Arboles project to plant trees and increase tree canopy coverage by 30% across eight Laredo schools: The project will provide students with greater opportunities for outdoor education, raise environmental awareness, create special outdoor areas for children with autism, and address the shortage of certified arborists in Laredo. This year, the Texas A&M Forestry Service announced a historic $15.4 million in grant funding through its Forestry Grant Program. The goal of the program is to build healthier urban and community forests throughout the state which are essential for the economic, environmental, physical and mental well-being of all Texans. Funding for the program significantly increased from $100,000 in 2022 to $16.65 million in 2023 as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act. ### Hoy, el congresista Henry Cuellar, Ph.D. (TX-28) anunció $3,120,000 en fondos federales para la silvicultura en los patios escolares de Laredo. Los fondos, otorgados por el Servicio Forestal de Texas A&M, fueron posibles gracias a la Ley de Reducción de la Inflación, que el Dr. Cuellar ayudó a aprobar en 2022. “Las comodidades de calidad del campus fomentan un ambiente de aprendizaje positivo para nuestros estudiantes. Los fondos anunciados hoy para el proyecto Adelante con Árboles brindarán una solución forestal urbana única para los estudiantes de Laredo a medida que aprenden más sobre las maravillas naturales de nuestro mundo,” dijo el Dr. Cuellar. “Aplaudo al Servicio Forestal de Texas A&M por utilizar dólares federales disponibles a través de la Ley de Reducción de la Inflación para invertir en el sur de Texas. Gracias a la Dra. Sylvia Guerra Ríos, Superintendente de LISD, y a Tricia Cortez, directora ejecutiva de RGISC, por trabajar conmigo para asegurar estos fondos para los estudiantes de Laredo.” “Más allá de embellecer nuestras escuelas, estos árboles desempeñarán un papel importante para hacer que nuestros campus se sientan más acogedores y atractivos,” afirmó la Superintendente de Escuelas de LISD, Dra. Sylvia G. Ríos. “Nuestros estudiantes verán crecer estos árboles y los conectarán con los gratos recuerdos de su experiencia educativa en LISD.” “Más importante aún, estos árboles también servirán como herramientas útiles para enseñar a nuestros estudiantes sobre el mundo que los rodea y la importancia y la responsabilidad que todos compartimos en el cuidado de nuestro medio ambiente,” exclamó Dr. Ríos. “Estamos muy agradecidos de recibir una subvención tan generosa y, como tal, estamos comprometidos a trabajar junto con nuestros socios comunitarios para impactar positivamente el mundo en el que vivimos,” reiteró Dr. Ríos. “Este es un día especial para tal anuncio; no sólo se llevará a cabo en el Día de la Tierra, sino que representa un nuevo paso adelante para nuestra ciudad fronteriza del sur de Texas. Este proyecto de Laredo fue uno de los cinco seleccionados en todo Texas y habla del compromiso de nuestra comunidad de aumentar la copa de los árboles nativos en Laredo ISD, brindar oportunidades de aprendizaje al aire libre para los estudiantes y comenzar a abordar el cambio climático y la isla de calor urbano severo en el centro de la ciudad,” dijo Tricia Cortez, directora ejecutiva de RGISC. Este premio ayudará al Distrito Escolar Independiente de Laredo (LISD) y al Centro de Estudios Internacionales Rio Grande (RGISC) a implementar su proyecto Adelante con Árboles para plantar árboles y aumentar la cobertura de copas de árboles en un 30% en ocho escuelas de Laredo: El proyecto brindará a los estudiantes mayores oportunidades de educación al aire libre, creará conciencia ambiental, creará áreas especiales al aire libre para niños con autismo y abordará la escasez de arbolistas certificados en Laredo. Este año, el Servicio Forestal de Texas A&M anunció una histórica donación de $15,4 millones en subvenciones a través de su Programa de Subvenciones Forestales. El objetivo del programa es construir bosques urbanos y comunitarios más saludables en todo el estado, que son esenciales para el bienestar económico, ambiental, físico y mental de todos los tejanos. La financiación del programa aumentó significativamente de $100,000 en 2022 a $16,65 millones en 2023 como resultado de la Ley de Reducción de la Inflación. ###",New Democrat Coalition,"['today

70,April 20,Ayanna Pressley,D,Mass.-7,Rep. Pressleys Statement on Israel and Ukraine Foreign Aid Votes,"April 20, 2024 WASHINGTON – Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) issued the following statement on her votes today on the House’s votes on foreign military aid packages for Israel, Ukraine..  Yesterday, Rep. Pressley filed a pair of amendments to increase funding to global humanitarian assistance and place a one-year moratorium on the transfer of offensive weapons to the Israeli military. The amendments were not adopted in the final legislation.  “In this moment of growing global conflict, I have consistently advocated for policies and budgets that save lives, promote de-escalation, and work toward peace across the globe. “It is unconscionable that Congress would consider sending more offensive weapons and funding to the Israeli military, which for months has operated with callous disregard for human life in Gaza and perpetrated significant human rights violations. Over 34,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces, millions of civilians in Gaza are on the brink of famine, and over 100 hostages are still held captive by Hamas. While I support Israel’s right to defend itself—especially following the horrific October 7th attack and I grieve deeply for those impacted—we cannot bomb our way to peace and become complicit as the Netaynahu government continues to massacre the Palestinian people. I voted NO on H.R. 8034 and continue to call for the United States to facilitate a lasting, bilateral ceasefire to save lives, return all hostages, deliver meaningful humanitarian aid to Gaza, and negotiate a long-term diplomatic solution that results in a just and lasting peace for Israelis and Palestinians alike.” “I also believe Congress should provide long-overdue assistance to help the Ukrainian people defend themselves against Vladimir Putin’s unjust and illegal invasion. This conflict has claimed the lives of tens of thousands of innocent people and displaced millions of others, and my heart breaks for the Ukrainian and Russian civilians who have had to deal with this unspeakable trauma. While I never take a vote on military aid lightly and believe diplomacy and humanitarian aid should be the priority, we have an obligation to stop Putin’s unjust invasion. I voted YES on H.R. 8035. “I am encouraged that Democrats were able to secure some global humanitarian aid in these bills, which will help mitigate these worsening crises. However, I am deeply disappointed that the Republican majority did not consider my amendment to drastically surge humanitarian aid to address the crises in Gaza and Ukraine, as well as in Haiti, Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan, and others. We must continue to prioritize global humanitarian assistance, including restoring critical funding for UNWRA. “As a parent, woman of faith, and caregiver, I pray that we can build a world where all of our children can thrive and know peace, whether they’re in Massachusetts, Gaza, Ukraine, Israel, or Haiti.”  Since the horrific October 7th attack, Congresswoman Pressley has consistently and stridently called for a ceasefire to save lives, return all hostages, and surge humanitarian aid to Gaza. This week, Rep. Pressley delivered a floor speech in which she called or urgent de-escalation in the Middle East and renewed her calls for a ceasefire in Gaza to prevent a broader regional war. As Co-Chair of the House Haiti Caucus, Rep. Pressley has also led calls for extending Temporary Protected Status for Haiti, a halt to deportations, a Haitian-led democratic transition, the delivery of humanitarian, economic and security assistance to the island, and more. Throughout the Israel and Hamas conflict, Rep. Pressley has been a vocal and consistent advocate of diplomacy, de-escalation, and saving lives. ### Washington DC Office 402 Cannon HOB

Today is, in many ways, Congress’ first official vote where we can weigh in on the direction of this war. If Congress votes to continue to supply offensive military aid, we make ourselves complicit in this tragedy.  “Our votes against H.R. 8034 are votes against supplying more offensive weapons that could result in more killings of civilians in Rafah and elsewhere. We believe strongly in Israel’s right to self-defense and have joined colleagues previously in affirming our shared commitment. “All of us support strengthening the Iron Dome and other defense systems and we are committed to a sovereign, safe, and secure future for Israel. To protect that future, we believe the United States must help achieve a ceasefire that allows hostages to be freed, humanitarian aid to be delivered, and peace talks to begin. “Benjamin Netanyahu appears willing to sacrifice the hostages while inflicting extraordinary suffering on the people of Gaza. He is willing to expand this conflict to preserve his power at the expense of Israel’s safety. In recent weeks, reports have indicated that Netanyahu is moving closer to a full-scale invasion of the southern Gaza town of Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians have taken shelter. When faced with the question of whether to provide offensive aid to further this conflict, we believe there is a moral imperative to find another path. “Most Americans do not want our government to write a blank check to further Prime Minister Netanyahu’s war in Gaza. The United States needs to help Israel find a path to win the peace.”  ###

72,April 19,Paul Gosar,R,Ariz.-9,Gosar Statement on Supporting the Motion to Vacate the Speaker," Washington, D.C. -- Congressman Paul A. Gosar, D.D.S. (AZ-09), issued the following statement after cosponsoring H.Res. 1103, Declaring the office of Speaker of the House of Representatives to be vacant, also known as the motion to vacate.  “Nearly 11 million illegal aliens have crossed our southern border in the past three years.  My congressional district in Arizona, ground zero for the invasion, is getting pummeled by the surge of lawbreakers. These illegal aliens have brought violent crime, deadly drugs, human trafficking and are depleting resources and services meant for U.S. citizens.  In fact, every state has become a border state.  Communities across the country are being ravaged, families are being destroyed and Americans in need are being ignored.    Congress cannot continue to turn a blind eye to the consequence of Biden’s disastrous open border policies, nor can it idly wait for Biden to halt this invasion through executive fiat.  Congress has the responsibility to solve this crisis.  Yet rather than spending the resources to secure our southern border and combating the invasion of 11 million illegals and despite repeated promises there would be no additional money going to Ukraine without first securing our border, the United States House of Representatives, under the direction of the Speaker, is on the verge of sending another $61 billion to further draw America into an endless and purposeless war in Ukraine. I have added my name in support of the motion to vacate the Speaker.  Our border cannot be an afterthought.  We need a Speaker who puts America first rather than bending to the reckless demands of the warmongers, neo-cons and the military industrial complex making billions from a costly and endless war half a world away,” concluded Congressman Gosar.   ###",Freedom Party,"['washington congressman paul gosar', 'issued following statement cosponsoring', 'declaring office speaker house representative vacant also known motion vacate', 'nearly million illegal alien crossed southern border past three year', 'congressional district arizona ground zero invasion getting pummeled surge lawbreaker', 'illegal alien brought violent crime deadly drug human trafficking depleting resource service meant citizen', 'fact every state become border state', 'community across country ravaged family destroyed american need ignored', 'congress continue turn blind eye consequence biden disastrous open border policy idly wait biden halt invasion executive fiat', 'congress responsibility solve crisis', 'yet rather spending resource secure southern border combating invasion million illegals despite repeated promise would additional money going ukraine without first securing border united state house representative direction speaker verge sending another billion draw america endless purposeless war ukraine', 'added name support motion vacate speaker', 'border afterthought', 'need speaker put america first rather bending reckless demand warmonger military industrial complex making billion costly endless war half world away concluded congressman gosar', '']",washington congressman paul gosar issued following statement cosponsoring declaring office speaker house representative vacant also known motion vacate nearly million illegal alien crossed southern border past three year congressional district arizona ground zero invasion getting pummeled surge lawbreaker illegal alien brought violent crime deadly drug human trafficking depleting resource service meant citizen fact every state become border state community across country ravaged family destroyed american need ignored congress continue turn blind eye consequence biden disastrous open border policy idly wait biden halt invasion executive fiat congress responsibility solve crisis yet rather spending resource secure southern border combating invasion million illegals despite repeated promise would additional money going ukraine without first securing border united state house representative direction speaker verge sending another billion draw america endless purposeless war ukraine added name support motion vacate speaker border afterthought need speaker put america first rather bending reckless demand warmonger military industrial complex making billion costly endless war half world away concluded congressman gosar
73,April 16,David Trone,D,Md.-6,"Congressman Trone Calls for Increased Funding for Job Training and Health Care, Improved Outcomes for the Bureau of Prisons in Hearing with AG Garland","FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE April 16, 2024 Congressman Trone Calls for Increased Funding for Job Training and Health Care, Improved Outcomes for the Bureau of Prisons in Hearing with AG Garland Congressman David Trone questions Attorney General Garland during the Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations Subcommittee hearing.  WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Congressman David Trone (D-MD) questioned Attorney General Garland during a Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations Subcommittee hearing. During the hearing, Trone asked questions about the Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) staffing shortages, ID cards, telemedicine, solitary confinement, de-escalation training, clean slate laws, and the antitrust division.  CONGRESSMAN DAVID TRONE: Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Cartwright, and thank you, Attorney General Garland for appearing here today, and thank you for your patience as you deal with this committee.  I’m a co-chair of the Bipartisan Second Chance Task Force, and we’re concerned about staffing shortages at the BOP. The BOP is funded at 93%.  But we’re only staffed at 86%. What’s happening is education, wraparound services for mental health, etc, which could improve our outcomes, job training, get left behind. So we’re all in agreement on that. We’d like to figure out how to implement the bipartisan First Step Act successfully. And to do that, we’ve got to have the staffing. Could you talk a minute about what this does to lead to lousy outcomes? Where we can’t cut our prison budget because we don’t give folks a second chance to win and succeed.   ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND: I do think that the money we have to provide more incentives for people to stay on the job in the Bureau of Prisons means that the chances of reducing recidivism will increase.  CONGRESSMAN DAVID TRONE: That sounds like a smart investment to me. Second quick question, 75 percent of BOP inmates do not have a photo ID when they leave prison. They can’t secure housing, apply for jobs, open a bank account, federal benefit programs, etc. The Bureau is addressing this by providing IDs to U. S. citizens now. We have a bipartisan bill, the BOP Release Card Act, that supports this effort at the BOP by ensuring new IDs fulfill all the requirements and directs BOP to work with the states to have a one-on-one exchange so we can work right with the states to move these folks into getting their new ID card and then successfully be able to exchange that for state ID cards. So we would appreciate your help in moving this bill forward. Does that make sense to you? ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND: Yeah, we would be happy to give technical assistance. I think we may, our staff may have already, our staffs may have already consulted on this, but of course, we’d be happy to give technical assistance. The BOP has implemented its own release ID program in October of 2023 and they’re on track for implementation by this spring. CONGRESSMAN DAVID TRONE: Excellent. Thank you. The DEA has extended current telemedicine flexibilities for prescribing controlled medications through December 31, ‘24.  But, there’s not a revised proposed rule and many patients are at risk of losing access to prescriptions needed for mental health and substance use disorder. Last year, my colleagues and I expressed concerns about the proposed DEA rule that would have limited patient access to buprenorphine and encourage an evidence-based approach to make permanent the use of audio-only or audio-visual telehealth technology for buprenorphine prescribing. This is crucial to reach these patient populations, including unhoused, rural, and tribal. So as a follow-up to that letter, we introduced the TREATS Act, which allows medication for opioid use disorder to be prescribed via telemedicine. What’s DOJ’s position on the continued use of telehealth flexibilities to ensure access to these medically necessary substance use disorder treatments? And how is this supported in your budget request?  ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND: So as you noted the DEA and HHS have extended the current telemedicine flexibilities until December 31st of this year. DEA has issued a proposed rule, which would allow authorized providers to prescribe medicines for opioid use disorder via telemedicine.  They are working to promulgate a final year by the — I’m sorry a final rule — by the fall of this year.   CONGRESSMAN DAVID TRONE: Okay, excellent. Thank you very much. Just quickly, restrictive housing, otherwise known as solitary confinement, outdated, inhumane practice often used way too far too often. We believe the BOP has been dragging its feet in reforming this area of restrictive housing. In the past 10 years, DOJ has conducted studies and task forces to improve restrictive housing, yet we fail to make any progress. What steps can DOJ and BOP take together so we can make this more effective and improve restrictive housing policies?  ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND: Well, the new BOP director is very much committed to what you’re talking about. BOP recently published a proposed rule on discipline designed to reduce the use of restrictive housing for disciplinary segregation. BOP is trying to hire more psychologists and provide de-escalation training which would help reduce the need for restrictive housing.  CONGRESSMAN DAVID TRONE: Excellent. Thank you very much. I yield back.   SECOND ROUND OF QUESTIONING CONGRESSMAN DAVID TRONE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Last year we helped pass the bipartisan Law Enforcement De-escalation Training Act, which provides 124 million in grant funding over four years for de-escalation training for police officers. This is going to save lives, improve police-community relations. Although this program is new, could you talk briefly about its implementation and more broadly how DOJ’s budget prioritizes mental health and crisis stabilization?  ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND: Yeah, I don’t have the specifics with respect to that program, but as a general matter, our COPS office and our Office of Justice Programs provide de-escalation, money for de-escalation training, it is an important way to protect the lives of officers and first respondents as well as the people who are calling for help. You are also right in the implication of your questions that many of these calls involve people who are mentally ill or have a mental impairment, and that the sensitivity of respondents to that possibility is an important element of the need for de-escalation.   CONGRESSMAN DAVID TRONE: Thank you for your efforts there. 70 to 100 million Americans have criminal records that appear on routine background checks, often preventing them from getting jobs. Over the last seven years, my company has hired about 1,400 returning citizens, which is good for business and cuts down recidivism. Automatic clearing records are costly and have been a barrier to widespread adoption. What resources does the DOJ need to help support these clean slate laws?   ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND: Well, I don’t think I’m, I’m gonna be able to, to talk to you specifically about the Clean Slate laws you know, in the area of criminal justice reform in the implementation of the Second Chance Act, which involves reentry programs, we’re asking for $125 million for those reentry programs. In addition, there is a new program called the Accelerating Justice System Reform Grants, which is a $300 million request for FY25 and $15 billion over 10 years. I’m not sure exactly whether the clean slate would fall within those, but I’ll ask my staff to get back to you on which of the grant programs go to the program here. CONGRESSMAN DAVID TRONE: Yeah, we’d love to keep working with you. Last quick question to build on represent — Ranking Member DeLauro on the antitrust division. Should this committee take another look at the language that eliminates — stops you from having full access to the merger filing fees and locks you into that $233 million?  ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND: Well, I’m gonna leave it to the Members of Congress to resolve this question. The Justice Department is in favor of the antitrust division getting full access to the fees. But you know, in the end, the Congress makes those determinations.  CONGRESSMAN DAVID TRONE: Seems like a good idea. Thank you.  ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND: It does seem like a good idea. Yes.  Congressman David Trone was elected to the House of Representatives in November 2018 to serve the 6th District of Maryland, which includes all or part of Montgomery, Frederick, Washington, Allegany, and Garrett Counties. Trone serves on the Appropriations, Budget, and Joint Economic Committees. In Congress, Trone is fighting to make progress on issues that matter to Marylanders. ###  Are you, or someone you know, struggling with a mental health or substance use disorder? You are not alone.

74,April 19,David Trone,D,Md.-6,"Trone, Cárdenas Lead Introduction of Resolution Declaring April 2024 as Second Chance Month","FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE April 19, 2024 Trone, Cárdenas Lead Introduction of Resolution Declaring April 2024 as Second Chance Month WASHINGTON, D.C.– Today, U.S. Representatives David Trone (D-MD-6), Tony Cárdenas (D-CA-29), Bruce Westerman (R-AR-4) and Don Bacon (R-NE-2) alongside U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Kevin Cramer (R-ND) reintroduced the bicameral Second Chance Month Resolution. The bicameral, bipartisan effort to designate April 2024 as Second Chance Month serves as reminder of the significant legal and societal barriers for the thousands returning from incarceration each year. In a nation that was founded on new possibilities, this resolution affirms that those who are returning home from jail or prison should have access to rehabilitation, redemption, and the chance to contribute positively to their communities. “Second Chance Month is an opportunity to recognize the importance of providing justice-impacted individuals with a real second chance at rebuilding their lives,” said Congressman David Trone, cofounder, and co-chair of the Second Chance Task Force. “After decades of overcriminalization, our country must make progress toward putting compassion over confinement. This month — and every month — we recommit ourselves to delivering on this promise.”  “Having witnessed firsthand the injustices that countless individuals in my community have faced upon reentry, I’ve made it a priority throughout my years as an elected official to advocate for the resources to make second chances possible,” said Congressman Tony Cárdenas. “In America every person deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, and we must continue to do everything in our power to ensure that people who were formerly incarcerated have access to reentry services and opportunities for a better tomorrow.” “Second Chance Month is an important platform to raise awareness of the challenges that formerly incarcerated individuals, who have paid their debt to society, experience in re-entering their communities,” said Congressman Bruce Westerman. “Opportunity after incarceration is critical to breaking the cycle of crime and reducing recidivism. I’m proud to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in this effort to acknowledge that second chances are paramount in fostering safer communities.” “Sadly, many formerly incarcerated individuals return to the prison system because they haven’t been given the opportunity to benefit from rehabilitation, given a chance at a job or training, and have faced scorn from their fellow man,” said Congressman Don Bacon. “The Second Chance Month Resolution highlights the need to focus on opening doors for those who are reentering society, instead of slamming them shut.” “We praise the Senate and House sponsors of the Second Chance Month resolution, which echoes the values shared by Prison Fellowship and the more than 800 churches and partners who believe that Americans with a criminal record can rise from their past, make amends, and reach their God-given potential,” said Heather Rice-Minus, CEO and President of Prison Fellowship. “We support the passing of this resolution and the lawmakers who strive to remove unfair and unnecessary barriers to work, housing, education, and other fundamentals for citizens who have paid their debt to society so they can live lives of productivity and purpose.” Congressman David Trone was elected to the House of Representatives in November 2018 to serve the 6th District of Maryland, which includes all or part of Montgomery, Frederick, Washington, Allegany, and Garrett Counties.

76,April 19,Ayanna Pressley,D,Mass.-7,"Pressley Files Amendments to Surge Global Humanitarian Aid, Restrict Offensive Weapons to Israeli Military","April 19, 2024 Amendments to Drastically Increase Humanitarian Assistance, Impose One-Year Moratorium on Offensive Weapons Transfers to IDF WASHINGTON – Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) filed an amendment to increase funding to global humanitarian assistance and an amendment to place a one-year moratorium on the transfer of offensive weapons to the Israeli military. “We find ourselves at a critical inflection point and every action taken by policymakers in this moment must be in pursuit of peace, de-escalation, and saving lives,” said Congresswoman Pressley. “Our amendments would help deliver desperately needed humanitarian assistance and stop the flow of offensive weapons that have been used by the Israeli military to kill Palestinians en masse.” The first amendment filed by Rep. Pressley would drastically increase the amount of humanitarian aid in the bill from $9.1 billion to $26.4 billion. This humanitarian aid would be used to address the worsening crises in Gaza and Ukraine, as well as in Haiti, Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan, and others. The second amendment filed would prevent the United States from sending offensive weapons to the Israeli military for one year. The amendment would allow the United States to continue providing missile defense systems to Israel, including the Iron Dome. The amendment comes amidst rising tensions in the Middle East, over 34,000 Palestinians killed in Gaza, 1,200 Israelis killed in Hamas’s horrific October attack, more than 100 hostages still held captive by Hamas, and millions of Gazans on the brink of famine.   Since the horrific October 7th attack, Congresswoman Pressley has consistently and stridently called for a ceasefire to save lives, return all hostages, and surge humanitarian aid to Gaza. This week, Rep. Pressley delivered a floor speech in which she called or urgent de-escalation in the Middle East and renewed her calls for a ceasefire in Gaza to prevent a broader regional war. As Co-Chair of the House Haiti Caucus, Rep. Pressley has also led calls for extending Temporary Protected Status for Haiti, a halt to deportations, a Haitian-led democratic transition, the delivery of humanitarian, economic and security assistance to the island, and more. Throughout the Israel and Hamas conflict, Rep. Pressley has been a vocal and consistent advocate of diplomacy, de-escalation, and saving lives. ### Washington DC Office 402 Cannon HOB

77,April 17,Abigail Spanberger,D,Va.-7,Spanberger Honors Baron Braswell & Gwendolyn Martinez at U.S. Capitol for Their Annual “Baron P. ‘Deuce’ Braswell Run Against Teen Violence”,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger yesterday presented Baron Braswell and Gwendolyn Martinez — the parents of Baron P. “Deuce” Braswell II — with the “Suzanne McDaniel Memorial Award for Public Awareness” for their work to prevent teen violence in Virginia through the “Baron P. ‘Deuce’ Braswell Run Against Teen Violence.” The Baron P. “Deuce” Braswell Run Against Teen Violence — now in its 19th year — honors the memory of Deuce, a Virginia teenager who was murdered in 2006 by a senseless act of teen violence. Created by Martinez and Braswell, the annual event unites families and teenagers to take a stand against violence in Spotsylvania, Fredericksburg, and the greater region. Each year, Baron and Gwen bring together students, parents, teachers, community leaders, elected officials at all levels, and the media to increase awareness, provide more resources, and prevent future loss. To honor their work, Spanberger joined the U.S. Congressional Crime Survivors and Justice Caucus in presenting Martinez and Braswell with this award, which recognizes those who use their voice to promote and bring about change to advance rights, awareness, and services for crime victims. Spanberger’s office nominated them for the award. Click here to watch the full video of Spanberger’s remarks, as well as the award presentation and comments from Martinez and Braswell. “I have the honor of recognizing that this award will go to Baron Braswell and Gwendolyn Martinez for the work that they do to bring attention to the issue of teen violence in our communities. In January of 2006, they lost their beloved son. He was a student athlete. He was an honorable student. Everyone that knew him loved him. He was a vibrant person,” said Spanberger during the ceremony. “After Deuce’s murder at a party, Gwen and Baron chose to make a change in our community — and they started an annual run, where community members are brought together in a beautiful, joyful, athletic event on a September morning in Virginia. We honor his life, people run a beautiful course, and — importantly — members of the community are educated on resources that are available related to preventing teen violence, related to joining in community with one another, and related to mental health and the challenges that face so many of our kids.” Spanberger continued, “They bring us all together in community to honor their son and remember their son. And there’s a scholarship — so that each year a kid from our region can go off to school and know that they are supported not just financially, but also in spirit. So many of our community members join together year after year to celebrate Deuce’s life and honor him — and I’m honored to present this award.” Click here for more information about the Baron P. “Deuce” Braswell Run Against Teen Violence. BACKGROUND The “Suzanne McDaniel Memorial Award for Public Awareness” honors Suzanne McDaniel, one of the first prosecutor-based victim advocates in Texas and in the country. McDaniel created Harris County’s first community interagency council on sexual assault and family violence and the first rape exam protocol for Houston Hospital and Medical Associations. She also formed the Texas Crime Victim Clearinghouse, the first statewide resource in the nation, and helped draft and pass the Texas Crime Victim Bill of Rights, the Texas Crime Victims’ Compensation Act, and the Texas Constitutional Amendment on Crime Victim Rights. McDaniel passed away in May 2012. The U.S. Congressional Crime Survivors and Justice Caucus focuses on elevating the voices of crime victims and survivors within the U.S. Congress in a bipartisan way. Spanberger has previously spoken at the Run Against Teen Violence to show solidarity with Deuce’s family, local leaders, law enforcement, students, and community members. ### Congresswoman: “We Have Too Much Work to Do to Waste Time on Petty Political Games” WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger today released the following statement after voting against U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene’s (R-GA-14) effort to throw the U.S. House of Representatives into chaos. “Since January 2023, this dysfunctional House Republican majority has […] The Common Ground Scorecard Ranked the Congresswoman as Tied for Fourth Place for Most Bipartisan Elected Official in the Country WASHINGTON, D.C. — The nonpartisan Common Ground Committee (CGC) once again ranked U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger as the most bipartisan Member of Congress from Virginia — and gave her the fourth-highest score of any lawmakers in […] Since the Start of 2019, the Congresswoman’s Office Has Returned More Than $38 Million in Backlogged IRS Refunds, Social Security Checks, VA Benefits, & More WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger announced today that her office has now returned more than $38 million in federal casework funds to residents of Virginia’s Seventh District.

79,April 17,Abigail Spanberger,D,Va.-7,"Spanberger, Kaine, Valadao Lead Bipartisan, Bicameral Effort to Expand Digital Skills in Workforce Training","The “Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act” Would Establish New “Digital Skills at Work” Grant Program to Expand Digital Workforce Skills for Americans Seeking Employment or Upskilling Opportunities WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger (D-VA-07), U.S. Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA), and U.S. Representative David Valadao (R-CA-22) today introduced bipartisan, bicameral legislation to expand access to digital skills training for American job seekers. According to the National Skills Coalition and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, 92 percent of today’s jobs require digital skills. Nearly one third of workers do not have the foundational digital skills — such as email, spreadsheets, or data entry — to enter and succeed in today’s workforce. Americans who can qualify for jobs requiring at least one digital skill earn 23 percent more income on average annually. Despite high demand across industries, digital skills training is not currently listed as an allowable use under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), federal legislation enacted to help job seekers access employment, education, training, and support services to succeed in the labor market. Because of this lack of allowance, one-stop workforce development career centers — physical sites within local workforce development areas across the United States where job seekers and employers can access programs, services, and resources — do not offer any digital skills training opportunities. The bipartisan, bicameral Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act would amend WIOA to establish a new “Digital Skills at Work” grant program to expand digital skills training within postsecondary education, adult education, and workforce development systems. This legislation would make specific, targeted investments in digital skills training to help Americans seeking jobs or upskilling opportunities and Americans with barriers to employment learn or build digital skills. Additionally, this bill would advance access to good-paying jobs and support the development of digitally resilient education and workforce systems. “When we help job seekers learn and refine on-the-job skills, we are helping Americans advance their careers and helping businesses hold on to adept and experienced employees. This bipartisan, bicameral legislation would empower states, localities, and local organizations — that are already doing incredible work to support our local workforces — to assist Virginians and Americans across the country in learning and building the industry-specific digital skills that will help them succeed in our 21st century economy,” said Spanberger. “Investments to close the digital skills gap help our workforce and our communities stay competitive and stay ahead, and I’m grateful for the support of Senator Kaine and Congressman Valadao as we work to deliver this support.” “Digital skills can be a gateway to new job opportunities for so many Virginians, especially at a time when I’m hearing from employers across the Commonwealth about how hard they’re working to hire up,” said Kaine. “The Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act would make it easier for people to access high-quality digital training programs to develop or hone those skills. Investing in our workforce is good for our workers, employers, and overall economy, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join us in supporting this bill.” “Ensuring people have the digital skills they need to navigate the modern job market is critical to the strength of our economy,” said Valadao. “When people enter the workforce with the foundational skills they need, it not only eases the burden on employers, but it sets people on a path to success for the rest of their careers. I’m proud to join Rep. Spanberger in introducing this bipartisan legislation that will help better prepare our workforce and strengthen our economy.” The bipartisan, bicameral Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act is endorsed by a number of local Chambers of Commerce, workforce development boards, education systems, and national education and skills training organizations — including the Virginia Chamber of Commerce, Northern Virginia Chamber of Commerce, Prince William Chamber of Commerce, Fredericksburg Regional Chamber of Commerce, Northern Virginia Black Chamber of Commerce, Virginia Minority Chambers, Inc., Virginia Community College System, Bay Consortium Workforce Development Board, National Skills Coalition, Coalition on Adult Basic Education, Hispanic Federation, National Coalition for Literacy, National Digital Inclusion Alliance, NTEN, American Libraries Association, and Third Way. “Digital skills are essential for both employers and employees. As technology continues to evolve, businesses must equip their workforce with the necessary skills to adapt and excel. For the Commonwealth of Virginia and our nation, we must invest in digital skills training, including upskilling and reskilling, to empower them to stay competitive in a rapidly changing digital world,” said Barry DuVal, President & CEO, Virginia Chamber of Commerce “The Northern Virginia Chamber strongly endorses Congresswoman Spanberger and Senator Kaine’s Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act. In the 2023 Virginia General Assembly session the Northern Virginia Chamber was the leading advocate for the Youngkin Administration’s Workforce Consolidation effort. This legislation will build on that effort and ensure that Virginia and the nation’s workforce will have the digital skills needed to be productive in the 21st century economy,” said Julie Coons, President & CEO, Northern Virginia Chamber of Commerce. “Today 92% of jobs require digital skills and currently a third of American workers do not have access to training to participate in today’s economy. We applaud Congresswoman Spanberger, Congressman David Valadao (R-CA) and Senator Tim Kaine for working in a bipartisan fashion to create grant programs for states and localities to help close the gap on these critical skills for today’s workers. We look forward to continuing to work to ensure this legislation is enacted into law.” “The Prince William Chamber of Commerce fully supports upskilling the American workforce,” said Bob Sweeney, President & CEO, Prince William Chamber of Commerce. “The proposed legislation hits the right folks at the right time! It provides an opportunity for ALL to access the essential digital skills required in the high-demand, high-wage sectors like Data Centers, modern manufacturing and other technology jobs.” “The demand for the current digital workforce is high and will only grow in the future,” said Kevin Dillard, Chair of the Board of Directors, Fredericksburg Regional Chamber. “Providing this opportunity to continue to build upon the digital skills of the workforce of today and of the future is paramount.” “The Northern Virginia Black Chamber of Commerce is proud to support the Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act, spearheaded by Congresswoman Spanberger and Senator Kaine and supported by bipartisan leaders including Rep. Valadao. This groundbreaking legislation addresses an urgent need within our workforce, where the digital divide continues to be a barrier to employment, particularly for communities of color, low-income families, and rural populations,” said Samuel Wiggins, Board Chair, Northern Virginia Black Chamber of Commerce. “As a chamber, our mission is to advocate for economic empowerment and to provide opportunities that foster business growth and workforce development among Black entrepreneurs and professionals. By endorsing this bill, which establishes the ‘Digital Skills at Work’ grant program under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, we are helping to ensure that our members and their communities are not left behind in the rapidly evolving digital economy.  The Northern Virginia Black Chamber of Commerce is committed to championing policies that tackle longstanding disparities and actively promote the economic development and success of our region and the entire country.” “Virginia Minority Chambers, Inc., fully endorses the upcoming Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act, introduced by Congresswoman Spanberger and Senator Kaine with bipartisan leaders like Rep. Valadao. This legislation addresses a pressing national issue—a digital skills gap affecting one-third of the US workforce—with a disproportionate impact on minority workers, low-income individuals, and rural residents due to historic underinvestment and structural inequities,” said Tonya Poindexter, Chief Operating Officer, Virginia Minority Chambers, Inc. “By establishing the ‘Digital Skills at Work’ grant program under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, the bill seeks to provide foundational digital skills necessary for success in today’s job market. Virginia Minority Chambers, Inc. appreciates the recognition of this critical need at the federal level and is committed to working with our federal and state partners to enhance both individual economic opportunities, especially in underserved communities, and the overall economic competitiveness of our nation. The passing of this bill is a vital step toward improving employment prospects across the country and ensuring our workforce is equipped to meet the demands of the digital age, particularly for those most affected by existing disparities.” “The introduction of Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act is a groundbreaking achievement for workforce stakeholders across the country. The bill supports National Skills Coalition research that finds that ninety-two percent of today’s jobs require digital skills, but only two thirds of workers have the foundational digital skills they need to succeed in today’s economy,” said Caroline Treschitta, Senior Government Affairs Manager, National Skills Coalition. “The bipartisan Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act addresses the digital skill divide by equipping workers and businesses with the digital training they need to ensure America remains competitive in the global economy.” Specifically, the Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act would: Click here for the full bill text. ### Congresswoman: “We Have Too Much Work to Do to Waste Time on Petty Political Games” WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger today released the following statement after voting against U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene’s (R-GA-14) effort to throw the U.S. House of Representatives into chaos. “Since January 2023, this dysfunctional House Republican majority has […] The Common Ground Scorecard Ranked the Congresswoman as Tied for Fourth Place for Most Bipartisan Elected Official in the Country WASHINGTON, D.C. — The nonpartisan Common Ground Committee (CGC) once again ranked U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger as the most bipartisan Member of Congress from Virginia — and gave her the fourth-highest score of any lawmakers in […] Since the Start of 2019, the Congresswoman’s Office Has Returned More Than $38 Million in Backlogged IRS Refunds, Social Security Checks, VA Benefits, & More WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger announced today that her office has now returned more than $38 million in federal casework funds to residents of Virginia’s Seventh District.

80,April 18,Brad Finstad,R,Minn.-1,Finstad Helps Introduce Legislation Implementing the Year-Round Sale of E15,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Congressman Brad Finstad (MN-01) joined Congressman Zach Nunn (IA-03) in introducing the Year-Round E15 Act, bipartisan legislation that would allow for the sale of E15 across eight Midwestern states.  The bipartisan Year-Round E15 Act would extend the Reid vapor pressure (RVP) volatility waiver to ethanol blends above 10 percent to allow for the year-round sale of E15 in Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Minnesota, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin for 2024.   “The ethanol industry is a driving force for southern Minnesota’s economy and provides a cleaner, low-cost energy source for consumers at the pump,” said Rep. Finstad. “Though the EPA recently announced the year-round sale of E15 in the Midwest starting in 2025, farmers, ethanol producers, and Americans' pocketbooks are footing the bill for this multi-year delay. I’m proud to help introduce this legislation which will allow for the sale of E15 this summer.”  “Since day one, I’ve been fighting for year-round E15. Unfortunately, this Administration has repeatedly put America’s producers and families behind as they stubbornly opposed E15, which is good for the economy, good for the climate, and good for families,” said Rep. Nunn. “This bill wouldn’t be necessary if the Administration had just done the right thing to begin with, but this is a critical step to provide certainty for farmers, producers, and families who will benefit from less expensive fuel.”  Background: In April of 2022, eight Midwestern governors submitted a letter urging the Biden Administration to allow year-round sales of E15. Under current law, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is required to act upon this request within 90 days. The EPA waited until March 6, 2023, just days before biofuel producers would have halted production, to issue a waiver for E15 sales for the summer of 2023.  On February 9, 2023, Rep. Finstad pressed the administration for action on year-round E-15, leading a bipartisan group of 31 members of both the Senate and the House of Representatives in sending a letter to EPA and Office of Management and Budget (OMB), urging the agencies to quickly implement their outstanding regulatory action on the request made the previous April.  In December 2023, Congressman Finstad led a bi-partisan letter urging the EPA and the OMB urging the administration to remove the 1-psi volatility waiver for gasoline and ethanol blends, like E15.  This follow-up letter was sent 300 days after Congressman Finstad led a bicameral letter with U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) urging the EPA and the OMB to act on the request made by the Midwestern governors.  On February 22, 2024, the EPA issued its final ruling to allow for the year-round sale of E15 beginning April 28, 2025, a year after the Biden Administration’s initial proposed implementation date of April 28, 2024. By delaying the implementation, the EPA is punishing American families and farmers who have already faced record inflation, skyrocketing fuel prices, and uncertainty in the market due to the Administration’s economic policies.

81,April 16,Jamaal Bowman,D,N.Y.-16,Congressman Jamaal Bowman Statement On Warmongering House Republican Legislation,"For Immediate Release WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Congressman Jamaal Bowman (NY-16) released the following statement in response to the House Republican floor votes on resolutions following the Iranian military attack on Israel and preceding Israeli military assault on an Iranian consulate: “The escalating violence in the region is dangerous and has the potential to become a full scale war. Our top priority should be de-escalating the ongoing conflict and preventing a regional war, not engaging in reckless political theater that will escalate violence, undermine the President’s use of flexibilities in sanctions to conduct diplomacy, and seek to target humanitarian aid and peace advocacy efforts around the world. That is why I’m opposing a series of bills that have been rushed to the floor by Republican warmongers in Congress. Instead, we must move forward and engage with solutions that center peace and our shared humanity.” ### Permalink: https://bowman.house.gov/2024/4/congressman-jamaal-bowman-statement-on-warmongering-house-republican-legislation

82,April 18,Jamaal Bowman,D,N.Y.-16,Congressman Jamaal Bowman Statement On H.Res. 1143,"For Immediate Release  WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Congress voted on the Republican Resolution H.Res. 1143 that would support escalation of violence in the Middle East and undermine President Biden’s calls for de-escalation. Congressman Jamaal Bowman, Ed.D. (NY-16) released the following statement: “I unequivocally condemn the Iranian military’s attack on Israel, just as I condemn the Israeli military attack on the Iranian consulate in Syria ordered by Prime Minister Netanyahu that sparked this dangerous escalation, which is why I voted against H.Res. 1143 today. President Biden has made it clear that he does not support escalating violence in the Middle East, which this resolution will contribute to by supporting further military action. We must do everything in our power to end the ongoing violence, pursue a lasting ceasefire, and save civilian lives. Instead of pushing resolutions that fan the flames of war, Congress should recognize all of the lives that have been lost, both Palestinian and Israeli. We have a moral responsibility to govern in a way that centers those most impacted and nurtures humanity instead of succumbing to more warmongering and violence.” ### Permalink: https://bowman.house.gov/2024/4/congressman-jamaal-bowman-statement-on-h-res-1143

83,April 18,Jamie Raskin,D,Md.-8,"Reps. Raskin, Stansbury, and Omar Push for Supreme Court Accountability with New Legislation?","WASHINGTON, DC — U.S. Representatives Jamie Raskin (MD-08), Melanie Stansbury (NM-01),  Ilhan Omar (MN-05), and Senator Richard Blumenthal (CT) today introduced the Judicial Ethics Enforcement Act of 2024 creating an Office of the Inspector General within the judicial branch and empowering the inspector general to conduct investigations of alleged violations of the Code of Conduct for Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States.  “Our people are in uproar over the money that billionaires and big corporations are spending to influence justices on the Supreme Court,” said Rep. Raskin. “Well-funded right-wing networks have poured money into reshaping the Court in their image and for their own purposes. Despite this flagrantly elitist and antidemocratic campaign, the highest court in the land continues to have the lowest ethical standards. This legislation takes a crucial step towards rebuilding the Supreme Court’s tarnished reputation and restoring its lost credibility with the American people. I'm grateful to my colleagues Representatives Stansbury and Omar for working with me to forward this critical effort to establish an Office of the Inspector General within the judicial branch. Thank you to Senator Blumenthal for leading the introduction of companion legislation in the Senate.” “Like every other federal entity, the Judiciary needs an Inspector General to deter and investigate internal wrongdoing — and restore public trust. After years of plummeting public confidence, the Courts need a watchdog to do prompt, impartial investigations of alleged conflicts of interest, improper benefits or other potential wrongdoing. Any ethics rules or code of conduct requires public accountability — otherwise it’s dead letter — as the Inspector General would provide,” said Sen. Blumenthal.  “Americans have lost trust in the Supreme Court,” said Rep. Stansbury. “Strong judicial ethics are critical to a free and democratic society. Safeguarding these fundamentals is necessary to ensuring we restore faith in our democracy and our institutions, and an Inspector General will hold the Justices internally accountable to the highest ethical standards to protect the Court from special interest groups looking to strip Americans of their rights to protect their personal agendas.” “For far too long, the highest court in our land has operated without true oversight,"" said Rep. Ilhan Omar. ""The American people deserve to have faith that the decisions being made by our judicial system are guided by the principles of fairness and the rule of law – not partisan politics or personal conflicts of interest. Our democracy depends on the integrity and impartiality of our judicial system. But in recent years, we've seen growing public mistrust as the Court has become increasingly ideological. This bill sends a clear message that the American people deserve transparency, accountability, and a Supreme Court that upholds the highest standards of ethical conduct.”  Specifically, the Judicial Ethics Enforcement Act of 2024 would: Create an Office of the Inspector General within the Judicial branch. Authorize the Inspector General to conduct investigations of alleged violations of the Code of Conduct for Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States. Authorize the powers and limitations of the Office of the Inspector General when investigating the Court. Structure the duties of the Inspector General which would include conducting and supervising audits and investigations, preventing and detecting waste, fraud, and abuse; and recommending changes in laws or regulations relating to the code of conduct adopted by the Supreme Court. Require the Inspector General to make prompt reports to the Chief Justice and to Congress on matters that may require action by the Chief Justice or Congress. Require the Inspector General to report expeditiously to the Attorney General whenever the Inspector General has reasonable grounds to believe there has been a violation of Federal criminal law.  Require the Inspector General to provide an annual report to both the House of Representatives and the Senate on the results of their investigations. Set appointments, term limits and removals of the inspector general. Provide protection for whistleblowers. Statements of support from organizations endorsing the legislation are below:   “The Supreme Court’s ongoing corruption crisis has undermined its credibility and caused public trust to plummet to record lows. Since the conflicted justices refuse to cut off their cozy relationships with their billionaire buddies, the crisis requires an urgent solution. The Judicial Ethics Enforcement Act is just that,” said Accountable.US President Caroline Ciccone. “Thanks to the strong leadership of Representatives Stansbury, Raskin, Omar, Hank Johnson, and several other original cosponsors, we’re one step closer to ensuring our high court serves everyday Americans — not justices’ wealthy pals and special interests.”  “CPD is proud to endorse the Judicial Ethics Enforcement Act and fight for the checks and balances this nation was founded upon,” said CPD Co-Executive Directors, Analilia Mejia and DaMareo Cooper. “Today’s Supreme Court is controlled by ultraconservative justices buried deep in the pockets of special interest groups committed to stripping our freedoms. It’s high time we held the Court to an ethics code that forces them to act with the fairness their job demands.” “The Supreme Court is in a state of crisis—between the corruption permeating its halls and the attacks on our fundamental freedoms, Americans have lost faith in our highest court,” said Tiffany Muller, President of End Citizens United // Let America Vote Action Fund. “The Judicial Ethics Enforcement Act of 2024 is a necessary step in holding the court accountable and restoring Americans’ confidence in the institution. We thank Congresswoman Stansbury and Senator Blumenthal for their ongoing leadership in the fight to reform the Supreme Court.”  ###    Permalink:

85,April 16,Greg Stanton,D,Ariz.-4,"Stanton, Ciscomani Introduce Bipartisan Bill to Improve Coordination Between Border Management Agencies","WASHINGTON, D.C.—Today Arizona Congressmen Greg Stanton and Juan Ciscomani introduced the Data for a Secured Border Act, bipartisan legislation to improve communication within the Department of Homeland Security and provide Congress with data to better inform decision-making. “To secure our southern border, decision makers need to see the whole picture—clearly and in real time. Our bill will break down bureaucratic silos, and give law enforcement on the frontlines the information they need to do their jobs,” Stanton said.  “In order to effectively address the issues at our southern border, we must have all the proper information and knowledge that is out there. By improving the collection and reporting of border-related metrics, Congress, CBP, and local authorities are able to work more efficiently to find proper solutions to secure our border,” Ciscomani said.  The bill would require DHS to submit a report to Congress on the usefulness of congressionally mandated border security metrics and to evaluate the work done by the Department’s Joint Requirements Council. The bill would also require DHS to make recommendations on updating border security metrics and to address how the JRC assists DHS in disrupting the flow of fentanyl, addressing the backlog of migrant processing, and incorporating technological advances into border management. A one page summary of the bill is HERE. Full text of the bill is HERE.  The legislation is endorsed by the Arizona Narcotic Officer’s Association, the Border Trade Alliance, and Fresh Produce Association of the Americas. “If lawmakers are going to advance policies that will lead to improved border management, then they need timely, reliable data. The Border Trade Alliance applauds Rep. Stanton for prioritizing an enhanced flow of information between DHS and Congress, which will lead to better decision making across government for the border. The BTA is pleased to support the bill and we look forward to working with Rep. Stanton to see the bill through to passage,” Britton Mullen, president, Border Trade Alliance, said. “Congressman Stanton’s attention to the workforce needs of U.S. Customs and Border Protection is much appreciated by the many businesses that rely on an efficient and transparent Customs process,” Lance Jungmeyer, President of the Fresh Produce Association of the Americas, said.“There has been much attention to making a secure border, and some of this effort needs to be at the Ports of Entry, where legitimate trade and travel is the driver of state, regional and local economies.” “The Arizona Narcotic Officer’s Association membership is comprised of 600+ law enforcement officers from throughout the State of Arizona. Federal, State and Local Officers meet throughout the year and collaborate on training and information sharing issues. Streamlining information is crucial to getting it correct and making it actionable. Steps in this legislation will go towards those goals, and ultimately allow us to serve our communities. ANOA supports the passage of this legislation,” James P. Molesa, Board Advisor for the Arizona Narcotic Officer’s Association, said.

87,April 19,Brian Fitzpatrick,R,Pa.-1,"Fitzpatrick, Golden Statement on Speaker Johnson’s Foreign Aid, Border Security Effort","WASHINGTON, DC — Congressmen Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-1) and Jared Golden (ME-2), the bipartisan co-leads of the Defending Borders, Defending Democracies Act, released the following statement as the House begins consideration of a foreign aid package and border security legislation:  “We have for months worked to keep up the pressure on our colleagues to act on foreign aid and the crisis at our Southern border because secure borders, ours and those of our democratic allies, are crucial to the defense of democracy against foreign actors hostile to America — whether they are Mexican drug cartels, Hamas terrorists, or dictators and autocrats in Iran, Russia, and China,” the Congressmen said.  “Since we introduced the Defending Borders, Defending Democracies Act in February, that pressure has resulted in appropriations to deploy the largest Border Patrol workforce our country has ever seen, hire new CBP officers to stop the flow of fentanyl from Mexico that is killing our children, and increase funding for security technology and local law enforcement in border states.  “Now we are on track to score another victory for borders and democracy. The foreign aid supplemental taken up by the House today provides aid for our allies in Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan and includes provisions we have fought for, including identical funding levels, a similar new loan structure for some of the foreign aid and the use of seized Russian assets to offset some of the cost. Its passage will tell the world that the United States will not stand by as dictators, terrorists, and totalitarians seek to expand their influence around the world.  “We will continue to push our colleagues and the president to take commonsense actions to secure the border, such as Congress reinstating Title 42-like expulsion authority and the president using his existing power to reinstate the Remain in Mexico policy. Today’s introduction on the House floor of the End the Border Catastrophe Act helps maintain momentum for real action from Congress and the president.” Permalink: https://fitzpatrick.house.gov/2024/4/fitzpatrick-golden-statement-on-speaker-johnson-s-foreign-aid-border-security-effort",Main Street,"['washington dc congressman brian fitzpatrick jared golden bipartisan defending border defending democracy act released following statement house begin consideration foreign aid package border security legislation month worked keep pressure colleague act foreign aid crisis southern border secure border democratic ally crucial defense democracy foreign actor hostile america whether mexican drug cartel hamas terrorist dictator autocrat iran russia china congressman said', 'since introduced defending border defending democracy act february pressure resulted appropriation deploy largest border patrol workforce country ever seen hire new cbp officer stop flow fentanyl mexico killing child increase funding security technology local law enforcement border state', 'track score another victory border democracy', 'foreign aid supplemental taken house today provides aid ally ukraine israel taiwan includes provision fought including identical funding level similar new loan structure foreign aid use seized russian asset offset cost', 'passage tell world united state stand dictator terrorist totalitarian seek expand influence around world', 'continue push colleague president take commonsense action secure border congress reinstating title expulsion authority president using existing power reinstate remain mexico policy', 'today introduction house floor end border catastrophe act help maintain momentum real action congress permalink']",washington dc congressman brian fitzpatrick jared golden bipartisan defending border defending democracy act released following statement house begin consideration foreign aid package border security legislation month worked keep pressure colleague act foreign aid crisis southern border secure border democratic ally crucial defense democracy foreign actor hostile america whether mexican drug cartel hamas terrorist dictator autocrat iran russia china congressman said since introduced defending border defending democracy act february pressure resulted appropriation deploy largest border patrol workforce country ever seen hire new cbp officer stop flow fentanyl mexico killing child increase funding security technology local law enforcement border state track score another victory border democracy foreign aid supplemental taken house today provides aid ally ukraine israel taiwan includes provision fought including identical funding level similar new loan structure foreign aid use seized russian asset offset cost passage tell world united state stand dictator terrorist totalitarian seek expand influence around world continue push colleague president take commonsense action secure border congress reinstating title expulsion authority president using existing power reinstate remain mexico policy today introduction house floor end border catastrophe act help maintain momentum real action congress permalink
88,April 19,Brian Fitzpatrick,R,Pa.-1,"Fitzpatrick, Pappas, Kildee, Gillibrand Introduce Bipartisan, Bicameral Legislation to Address PFAS Contamination and Hold Polluters Accountable","WASHINGTON, DC – Representatives Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-1), Chris Pappas (NH-1), Dan Kildee (MI-18), and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (NY) re-introduced the bipartisan, bicameral Clean Water Standards for PFAS Act. This legislation requires EPA to develop water criteria for PFAS under the Clean Water Act and provides EPA with an ambitious yet achievable roadmap to establish effluent limitations guidelines (ELGs) and standards for eight priority industry categories for all measurable PFAS or classes of PFAS within three years. The bill also includes significant federal support to assist communities in upgrading their municipal water infrastructure in order to safeguard public health and protect ratepayers. “Congress must do everything it can to set and enforce criteria to keep PFAS (per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances) chemicals out of Americans’ drinking water,” said Congressional PFAS Task Force Co-Chair Congressman Fitzpatrick. “I am proud to join Reps. Pappas and Kildee and Sen. Gillibrand in introducing the Clean Water Standards for PFAS Act to improve water quality, prevent the leakage of these ‘forever chemicals’ and ensure that our drinking water will be safe for every generation to come.” ""The dangers posed by ‘forever chemicals’ like PFAS remain one of the most pressing environmental and public health issues of our time,"" said Congressman Chris Pappas. “The Clean Water Standards for PFAS Act will finally take action to hold polluters accountable, establish proactive limits for PFAS, set water quality criteria, and support communities with contaminated water. No industry should be given a free pass to poison our water, no community should bear the burden of addressing this challenge alone, and no family should ever have to wonder whether their drinking water is safe when they turn on the tap. I am proud to re-introduce this legislation today, and I will keep fighting to protect our water until it is enacted into law."" ""Access to safe, affordable drinking water should be a right, not a privilege,"" said Congressman Kildee. ""I’m proud to be introducing this critical bill to hold corporate polluters accountable and protect our communities from dangerous PFAS chemicals. As co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional PFAS Task Force, I will continue working with Republicans and Democrats to protect mid-Michigan families from these toxic chemicals."" “Access to clean water and healthy environments is an essential right that all Americans deserve, yet is actively under threat due to the PFAS contamination crisis,” said Senator Gillibrand. “For decades, thousands of manufacturers have been allowed to legally discharge PFAS, exposing far too many communities across New York State and the country to these toxic chemicals. The Clean Water Standards for PFAS Act would finally address these harmful industrial discharges and complement EPA’s recently announced first-ever national drinking water standard for PFAS. I’m proud to work alongside Representative Pappas on this important bill and will keep fighting to protect the public from dangerous PFAS chemicals.”  “Industries shouldn’t be able to dump as much PFAS as they like into nearby rivers, streams, and lakes, putting the health of their neighbors at risk,” said Melanie Benesh, Vice President for Government Affairs at the Environmental Working Group. “The Clean Water Standards for PFAS Act is a critical piece of legislation that will ensure that the EPA acts quickly to turn off the tap on some of the most notorious PFAS polluting industries.” “NACWA is pleased to support the Clean Water Standards for PFAS Act. This legislation sets timelines and parameters around EPA actions underway to regulate PFAS under the Clean Water Act, including pretreatment standards, effluent limits, and water quality standards. The bill smartly targets industrial PFAS discharges to waterways and industrial discharges to clean water agencies as a key first step - in line with “Polluter Pays” principles. Through public clean water agencies’ pretreatment programs,  these utilities can work with industrial dischargers to implement these limits and protect the environment and public health. The bill also requires EPA to promulgate a final method to measure PFAS in wastewater and other key environmental media – an essential step that utilities need before being required to meet CWA limits. These actions will require significant investment and work by clean water agencies – who are willing to be an equitable part of the solution but are not the source of PFAS. For this reason, the bill’s authorization of $1 billion between Fiscal Years 2024-2028 recognizes the need to ensure ratepayers are not held responsible for industry actions and have the financial support needed to meet the requirements set out in this legislation,” said Adam Krantz, CEO of the National Association of Clean Water Agencies.

89,April 19,Brian Fitzpatrick,R,Pa.-1,"Fitzpatrick, Bipartisan Colleagues Introduce Bill to Prevent U.S. Trade Policy Favoring Foreign E-Commerce","WASHINGTON, DC – Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-1), Brad Wenstrup (OH-2), Mike Carey (OH-15), Ruben Gallego (AZ-3), Lou Correa (CA-46), and Carol Miller (WV-1) introduced H.R. 8059, the U.S. Foreign Trade Zone Parity Act, a bipartisan bill to prevent U.S. trade policy from favoring the foreign e-commerce distribution operations that undermine U.S.-based operations. Current U.S. law allows companies to ship products directly from foreign warehouses to U.S. consumers duty and tax-free (including exemption from additional Section 301 China tariffs) if the products are valued at $800 or less. Retailers and brands located within U.S.-based foreign trade zones (FTZs) are barred from this same duty-free benefit on otherwise identical shipments and face up to a 60% cost disadvantage per shipment. This bill fixes that issue, allowing companies operating in the nearly 300 U.S. based FTZs to utilize de minimis entry procedures, creating parity with foreign distributors. The U.S. Foreign Trade Zone Parity Act complements the Ways and Means Committee’s strong action this week to crack down on China’s de minimis abuses by making products subject to the Section 301 tariffs ineligible for de minimis entry. “E-commerce shipments from outside the United States should not be afforded special treatment compared to shipments from inside the U.S.,” said Congressman Fitzpatrick.  “I’m proud to co-sponsor this bipartisan legislation that would create parity in U.S. trade laws and preserve the jobs of hardworking Americans.” ""Our current trade policy counterintuitively benefits adversaries like China, and causes the loss of American jobs and opportunity. I believe it's important for our trade and foreign policy to align; and I'm pleased that my colleagues, both Democrat and Republican, have joined me on this bill to ensure our trade policy doesn't punish U.S. businesses operating within the U.S.,"" said Congressman Wenstrup. “For nearly a century, U.S. Foreign Trade Zones have supported American jobs, improved trade and lessened our dependence on foreign adversaries. However, it’s time we update our trade rules for a 21st century economy. I’m proud to join Representative Wenstrup in this effort to keep America competitive,” said Congressman Carey. “Foreign Trade Zones are vital to the strength of our supply chain and for supporting U.S. jobs,” said Congressman Gallego. “I am proud to back this bill to finally bring parity to FTZs, ease supply chain burdens, and keep our economy moving.” ""The National Association of Foreign-Trade Zones (NAFTZ) is grateful for the introduction of the bipartisan U.S. Foreign Trade Zone Parity Act of 2024 (H.R. 8059) led by Representatives Brad Wenstrup (R-OH) and co-sponsored by Lou Correa (D-CA), Carol Miller (R-WV), Ruben Gallego (D-AZ), Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA), and Mike Carey (R-OH). The legislation will level the playing field for U.S.-based operations distributing from an FTZ and ensure retention of American jobs while spurring further economic growth within the boundaries of the United States. Congressman Wenstrup’s bill eliminates the existing incentive to establish or relocate operations across the border, resulting in no change to the volume of de minimis trade, only where those transactions originate and extends that parity to operations under the oversight of two distinct federal agencies. We recognize the on-going dialogue associated with de minimis entry and this legislation is intended solely to provide parity to U.S. FTZs based on whatever action Congress ultimately takes where de minimis is concerned,"" said Jeff Tafel, President, the National Association of Foreign-Trade Zones.

91,April 18,Andy Barr,R,Ky.-6,Barr’s CRA to Nullify Credit Card Late Fee Rule Advances Out of Committee,"Washington, DC – Yesterday, the House Financial Services Committee advanced Congressman Barr’s Congressional Review Act (CRA) to nullify the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s (CFPB) credit card late fee rule. This rule would cripple hardworking Americans’ ability to access financial services and products. ""This CRA sends a strong rebuke to the CFPB's overreach in its latest ill-conceived rule on credit card late fees,” said Congressman Barr. “In an effort to push a political agenda ahead of the presidential election, the CFPB will harm the very individuals it is tasked to protect by increasing the cost of credit, decreasing the availability of financial products and services, and penalizing consumers who pay their credit card payments on time. Ultimately, this rule will stifle Americans’ economic mobility and prosperity by incentivizing them to take on additional debt, which will lower their credit score, resulting in the reduced possibility of achieving the goal of homeownership, financing a vehicle, or accessing credit for other needs. The Biden administration has shown time and again that they believe debts do not need to be repaid. This CRA will nullify a rule that will result in nothing but bad outcomes for consumers. I look forward to working with Senator Scott to ensure this bill advances through both chambers and is sent to President Biden’s desk.” Watch Congressman Barr’s remarks in support of his CRA here.

92,April 17,Cori Bush,D,Mo.-1,"Representatives Bush, Pressley, and Porter Join Community Safety Working Group for the Launch of a Community Safety Agenda","   Washington, D.C. (Apr. 17, 2024) –Congresswoman Cori Bush (MO-01), Ayanna Pressley (MA-07), and Katie Porter (CA-47) joined the Community Safety Working Group, a coalition of 70+ organizations with an affirmative vision of public safety, for the launch of the Community Safety Agenda, which includes priority legislation champions affirmative, evidence-based approaches to public safety. “Public safety is public health, and our movement demands transformative changes to our government’s current approach. We need to end the status quo of police brutality and mass incarceration, and channel massive investments into systems of care, not criminalization, that are rooted in improving the safety and well-being of all communities,” said Congresswoman Cori Bush. “One of my greatest privileges continues to be bringing this movement from the streets to the halls of Congress. And that is exactly the intention behind the People’s Response Act. Congress must move to pass this lifesaving legislation.” “The over-criminalization of our K-12 schools is not just an inequity — it is a crisis in and of itself. So we must be intentional about confronting it head on and advancing policies and budgets that promote trauma-informed learning environments where our students can learn free from fear,"" said Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley. ""I'm proud to see critical legislation like the Counseling Not Criminalization in Schools Act gain the support of this broad coalition. Congress must pass this bill and we must continue working to dismantle systems of oppression in America wherever they exist."" “One in five fatal police shootings ends the life of a person with mental illness. This is unacceptable,” said Rep. Katie Porter. “I’m proud that more than 110 of my colleagues are again supporting my bipartisan Mental Health Justice Act, which would provide grants to hire, train, and dispatch mental health responders to people in crisis. Having the right type of responders for mental health emergencies will save lives, make our communities safer, reduce the strain on our criminal justice system, and stop distracting law enforcement from fighting crime. Congress should get this bill across the finish line.” “We are proud to be supporters of the People’s Response Act, which puts humanity first by emphasizing an inclusive, holistic, and health-centered approach to public safety. More police, and more funding for police will not keep our communities safe. Despite the evidence that punitive interventions make us less safe, we continue to see more and more people endorsing stale, old “tough on crime” tactics. It is time to shift this thinking and promote alternatives to law enforcement that are proven to be effective, ” said Michael Huggins, Deputy Senior Director of Policy and Government Affairs at Color Of Change. “As a teacher I wanted what every person wants — to keep their kids safe, their family safe, and their community safe,” said Thea Sebastian, Executive Director of The Futures Institute. “I couldn’t achieve this goal within my classroom. But through this agenda, and alongside the incredible lawmakers and advocates represented here now, I finally have a chance to do so. Over this next year, I look forward to working with all of you — and the more than 90 organizations that have endorsed this agenda and support our Community Safety Working Group — toward making these policy changes a reality, and toward building the new, evidence-based paradigm that will actually keep our kids and communities safe.” Watch the full recording of the press conference HERE. The people who spoke at the press conference, include: Congresswoman Cori Bush (MO-01) Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) Congresswoman Katie Porter (CA-47) Michael Huggins, Color of Change Thea Sebastian, The Futures Institute Rukia Lumumba, Movement For Black Lives  Will Simpson, Equal Justice USA Remarks  Jason Kimelman-Block, Bend the Arc Alex Dilon, March For Our Lives Kelsey Reyes And Ruth Martin, MomsRising  The bills endorsed by the Community Safety Agenda, include, among other things: People's Response Act introduced by Representatives Cori Bush (MO-01), Ayanna Pressley (MA-07), Pramila Jayapal (WA-07), Jan Schakowsky (IL-09), Summer Lee (PA-12), and Morgan McGarvey (KY-03) would create a division on Community Safety within the Department of Health and Human Services that would research and fund life-saving alternatives to incarceration and policing, as well as provide funding opportunities for community-based, non-carceral responses to community safety. Mental Health Justice Act introduced by Representatives Katie Porter (CA-47), Antonio Cárdenas (CA-29), Ayanna Pressley (MA-07), Mary Scanlon (PA-05) and Senator Warren (D-MA) creates a grant program that allows states, tribes, and localities to hire, train, and dispatch mental health professionals to respond to mental health emergencies when 911, 988, or another emergency hotline is called. Opening Doors to Youth Act introduced by Representatives Jesús Garcia (IL-14), Bobby Scott (VA-03), Frederica Wilson (FL-24), and Jahana Hayes (CT-5) establishes and expands youth employment programs through community-based organizations that provide at-risk and opportunity youth with comprehensive pathways to remain connected or reconnect to education and training systems in addition to the supportive services needed to overcome individual barriers to reconnection. Counseling Not Criminalization in Schools Act introduced by Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) and Senator Chris Murphy(D-CT) prohibits federal funds from being used to keep police in schools. Instead, it directs billions towards hiring counselors and support staff, making schools safer and more supportive for all students. As Congress’s first activist from the movement to save Black lives,  Congresswoman Bush has been a fierce advocate for an affirmative, evidence-based approach to public safety. Her flagship bill, the People’s Response Act, is among the legislation that is prioritized in the Community Safety Agenda. Specifically, the People’s Response Act legislation would: Create a Division on Community Safety within HHS to fund, conduct, and coordinate research, technical assistance, and grant programs related to non-carceral, health-centered investments in public safety; Launch a federal first responders unit to support states and local governments with emergency health crises; Promote alternative approaches to public safety, including coordination of research and policies that are being implemented across HHS and other agencies to center health-based and non-carceral responses throughout the federal government; Provide $11 billion in grant funding to state and local governments, as well as community-based organizations, to fully fund public safety and improve crisis response; and Establish a $2.5 billion First Responder Hiring Grant to create thousands of jobs and provide funding to state, local, and tribal governments, as well as community organizations, to hire emergency first responders such as licensed social workers, mental health counselors, substance use counselors, and peer support specialists, in an effort to improve crisis response and increase non-carceral, health-based approaches to public safety.  ",Congress Progressive,"['washington apr', 'cori bush ayanna pressley katie porter joined community safety working group coalition organization affirmative

93,April 16,Bonnie Watson Coleman,D,N.J.-12,Rep. Watson Coleman Statement on Partisan GOP Stunt to Exploit Mid-East Crisis,"Washington D.C. (April 16, 2024) - Today, as House Republicans brought forth yet another messaging bill that fails to address the urgent crisis in the Middle East, Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman (NJ-12) made the following statement on House Resolution 883:  ""Antisemitism is a threat to our communities here and abroad and should be addressed in concrete ways in order to protect our Jewish neighbors. But, continuing to vote on non-binding messaging resolutions to score partisan political points is not a concrete solution and is disrespectful to the seriousness of the situation. ""This resolution inflames tensions when de-escalation must be the goal. As the conflict in the Middle East worsens and the humanitarian need grows every day, Congress must be focused on passing supplemental aid that addresses dire needs, eliminating Hamas, securing safe release of the hostages, and working towards a two-state solution. Aid to Ukraine, Taiwan, suffering Palestinian civilians, and the defense of our ally Israel is paramount. ""Today’s frivolous resolution condemning the phrase 'from the river to the sea' - a phrase already condemned by the House of Representatives - is yet another distraction.  ""The American people don't want to be pulled into a broader regional war; they want us to expand the Child Tax Credit, address gun violence, mental health, climate change, and affordable health care and child care and they deserve a Congress that will deliver on these issues.

94,April 16,Jared Huffman,D,Calif.-2,"Huffman, Napolitano Introduce Legislation to Boost Large-Scale Water Recycling Projects in the West","Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Representatives Jared Huffman (CA-02), Grace F. Napolitano (CA-31), Raúl M. Grijalva (AZ-07), and Susie Lee (NV-03) introduced H.R. 7990, the Large-Scale Water Recycling Reauthorization and Investment Act of 2024, to reauthorize a water recycling grant program for large-scale projects in California and the other sixteen western states. “This program for large-scale water recycling and reuse that we secured in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law has been a great success, and we shouldn’t let that progress peter out. Our bill would reauthorize funding for this grant program, help bolster the great projects already underway, and ensure it can continue expanding,” said Rep. Huffman. “I'm glad to join Rep. Napolitano in this effort and am grateful for her leadership in meeting the needs of everyone with a stake in America's water future.” ""Thanks to President Joe Biden, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Camille Calimlim Touton, and our fellow Democrats in Congress, the game-changing Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $450 Million for vital large-scale water recycling projects, including Pure Water and the Hyperion project in Southern California,"" Napolitano said. ""As we combat extreme drought and prepare for future water shortages in the arid West, Congress must provide additional funding opportunities now to help boost these existing large-scale recycling projects and get new ones off the ground. I thank Representatives Grijalva, Huffman, and Lee for their partnership in championing cost-effective, large-scale water recycling projects and further securing a sustainable, drought-proof water supply for our communities."" “The climate crisis is affecting nearly every aspect of our lives, but for those of us who live in the West, the dwindling water supply is often top of mind,” Grijalva said. “This legislation builds on the success of water recycling projects funded by the IIJA and put in place by the Biden administration to provide a sustainable solution that can stretch our water supply for millions of people in the years to come. I want to thank Congresswoman Napolitano for her effective leadership on this legislation and for being a longstanding champion of water supply projects over the years.” “We need to save every drop of water we can to combat one of the worst droughts in the history of the American West,” said Congresswoman Susie Lee. “That’s why I was proud to deliver over $122 million for local water projects last year and why I’m so proud to help lead the reauthorization of the Large-Scale Water Recycling Project Grant Program this year. This critical program was made possible by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that I helped negotiate and pass, and I look forward to seeing it reauthorized for another six years to continue delivering the resources our communities need.” The Large-Scale Water Recycling Reauthorization and Investment Act of 2024, reauthorizes the successful Large-Scale Water Recycling grant program within the Department of the Interior for six years for large-scale water recycling projects that have a total estimated cost of at least $1 Billion. The legislation increases the authorization from $450 Million to $1 Billion for the program; projects must be within one of the Bureau of Reclamation's seventeen western states.

95,April 17,Jared Huffman,D,Calif.-2,"Huffman, Whitehouse, Transatlantic Climate Leaders Call for Safeguards Around International Plastics Talks to Prevent Industry Obstruction","Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Representative Jared Huffman (CA-02) along with U.S. Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), and Peter Welch (D-VT), and Member of the European Parliament Mohammed Chahim, led eight other international lawmakers in a letter calling on world leaders to limit plastic producers and other industry officials from unduly influencing efforts by the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee on Plastic Pollution (INC) to combat the scourge of plastic pollution.  Next week, government leaders and international stakeholders will gather for INC-4 in Ottawa, Canada to negotiate the creation of a global plastic pollution treaty. The lawmakers’ letter was addressed to U.S. President Joe Biden, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, United Nations Secretary General António Guterres, and INC Executive Secretary Jyoti Mathur-Filipp.  The letter was also signed by Senators Ben Cardin (D-MD), Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Representatives Adriano Espaillat (NY-13), Eleanor Holmes Norton (DC-01), Seth Magaziner (RI-02), Jan Schakowsky (IL-09), and Melanie Stansbury (NM-01). “Given the great urgency of the plastic crisis, we must unblock the barriers that have kept us from advancing strong global collaboration to combat plastic pollution.  The political influence and obstruction of certain plastic producing industries, petrochemical companies, and other relevant industrial stakeholders has been and remains one of the largest barriers to strong action,” wrote the lawmakers.  “We urge you to institute new policies for corporate and industrial sector representatives participation at negotiating sessions, including requiring participating industries to submit an audited corporate political influencing statement that discloses plastics and climate-related lobbying, campaign contributions, and funding of trade associations and organizations active on plastics and climate issues.  These statements should be reviewed, publicly disclosed, and scrutinized prior to any engagement in INC negotiations.  The INC should also consider additional measures to establish a robust accountability framework to protect against undue influence of corporate actors with proven vested interests that contradict the goals of the global plastics treaty,” added the lawmakers. “These reforms would bring much-needed transparency to industrial plastics-related political influencing activities around the world, and they would help to ensure that the INC process is a good faith effort by countries to solve the plastic pollution crisis,” continued the lawmakers.  The crisis of plastic pollution threatens the planet’s most important natural resources and disproportionately harms vulnerable populations.  About 450,000,000 tons of plastic are produced every year, a number that is projected to triple by 2050.  In the United States, less than 3 percent of plastic waste is recycled into a similar quality product and research shows human beings swallow the amount of plastic in the typical credit card every week. The text of the letter is below and a PDF is available here. Dear President Biden, President von der Leyen, Secretary General Guterres, and Executive Secretary Mathur-Filipp: We, the undersigned Members of the United States Congress and Members of the European Parliament, write to urge you to address the ability of plastic producing corporations and other industry stakeholders that are highly dependent on plastic, particularly single-use, packaging, disposable and non-durable plastics to exert undue influence on efforts by the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee on Plastic Pollution (INC) to develop an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution. Ahead of the upcoming fourth INC negotiating session, enacting policies that call for the disclosure of representatives for plastic producing industries, petrochemical companies, and other relevant industrial stakeholders that are participating in INC meetings will help ensure that science takes precedence in the outcomes of the agreement. We urge you to take immediate steps to monitor and disclose the influence of plastic producing industries, petrochemical companies, and other relevant industrial stakeholders. As national delegations, independent scientists, civil society organizations, Indigenous Peoples, women, and youth work to develop an ambitious treaty that addresses the full life cycle of plastic pollution, we are concerned that certain corporate interests have outsized influence on the negotiations and would seek to limit commitments and responsibilities to proportionately contribute and implement reforms essential to holistically solve the world’s challenge with plastic pollution. As an illustration of how deep inequities in power and access play out in these negotiations, the chemical and fossil fuel representatives registered to attend the third INC negotiating session outnumber officials from Pacific Small Island Developing States by more than two to one and those of the Scientists’ Coalition for an Effective Plastics Treaty by more than three to one.[1] The    143 known fossil fuel and chemical industry lobbyists registered mark a 36% increase from INC- 2 and are a larger group than the number of delegates from the 70 smallest Member States.[2] This overwhelming discrepancy between the number of attendees representing petrochemical industries, which have a vested financial interest in maintaining the status quo, and national and scientific representatives, makes it glaringly obvious how industrial actors’ influence could obstruct meaningful progress. As you know, there is no room for delay to reach an agreement to end the flow of plastics into our environment and commit to a circular economy. To achieve INC’s goal of developing a treaty that addresses the full plastic life cycle, we must acknowledge that plastic pollution begins with fossil fuel extraction. 99% of plastics are produced from fossil fuel-based petrochemicals, which will represent nearly half of oil demand growth by 2050. [3],[4] We cannot recycle our way out of this mess; the U.S. recycling rate stands at a dismal 9%, and less than 10% of all plastic waste generated globally has ever been recycled.[5],[6] Even if we improved our current waste management and recycling systems, not all plastics are recyclable, and some products can only be recycled once or twice.[7] If the new agreement doesn’t adequately address plastic production, particularly the production of single-use and non-durable plastics, no amount of cleanup will protect our environment and health from this crisis. Given the great urgency of the plastic crisis, we must unblock the barriers that have kept us from advancing strong global collaboration to combat plastic pollution. The political influence and obstruction of certain plastic producing industries, petrochemical companies, and other relevant industrial stakeholders has been and remains one of the largest barriers to strong action. Fossil fuel companies and their industry allies have spent billions of dollars lobbying the European Parliament, other European institutions and Member States, the U.S. Congress, and U.S. Executive Branch agencies in order to obstruct or weaken plastics and climate policy for years. Companies attending INC-3 spent more than $85 million on lobbying and political contributions during the 2022 U.S. elections alone.[8] While we acknowledge that engaging with industry can play a role, doing so with industry stakeholders that have consistently engaged in bad faith should be undertaken with extreme caution. A former president of the Plastics Industry Association once said, ""If the public thinks that recycling is working, then they are not going to be as concerned about the environment.""[9] For more than 30 years, the plastics industry has known that recycling is prohibitively expensive and infeasible, yet it spent tens of millions of dollars on ads to deceive the public and place the burden on individual consumers.[10],[11] Today, hundreds of millions of tons of plastic are produced each year and the rate is projected to nearly triple from 2019 levels by 2050.[12] The equivalent of one garbage truck load of plastic is dumped into the oceans every minute, resulting in waste that lingers in our environment, breaking down into ever smaller microplastics. We cannot afford to dump any more.[13] Moreover, plastics account for 3.4% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.[14] As the world shifts away from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy, the world must also move away from plastic. The planet has already warmed over 1.1°C, and every moment of delay makes to the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C that much more difficult.[15] Drastically reducing plastic production and consumption, and eliminating single-use plastics from global commerce, is essential to achieving critical global climate goals. In April, world governments will gather in Ottawa for INC-4, a critical stage to negotiate treaty text and determine its strength. Parties must seize the opportunity to take ambitious and actionable steps to advancing a science and health-outcomes based global framework for addressing plastic pollution and the life-cycle of plastic through the INC decision-making process. We urge you to institute new policies for corporate and industrial sector representatives’ participation at negotiating sessions, including requiring participating industries to submit an audited corporate political influencing statement that discloses plastics and climate-related lobbying, campaign contributions, and funding of trade associations and organizations active on plastics and climate issues. These statements should be reviewed, publicly disclosed, and scrutinized prior to any engagement in INC negotiations. The INC should also consider additional measures to establish a robust accountability framework to protect against undue influence of corporate actors with proven vested interests that contradict the goals of the global plastics treaty. These reforms would bring much-needed transparency to industrial plastics- related political influencing activities around the world, and they would help to ensure that the INC process is a good faith effort by countries to solve the plastic pollution crisis. We note that this is not the first time that many of us have advocated that the United Nations adopt policies that would limit corporate actors with conflicts of interest from obstructing progress. In May and November 2023, many of the undersigned wrote to U.S., EU, UN and United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) leadership calling on them to work together to institute new policies for corporate participation in Conferences of the Parties (COPs) and UNFCCC processes more broadly, including requiring participating companies to submit an audited corporate political influencing statement that discloses climate related lobbying, campaign contributions, and funding of trade associations and organizations active on energy and climate issues.[16],[17] For the past several years, as in INCs, the number of  attendees representing polluting corporate actors at COPs has been larger than the delegations of nearly every country in attendance. Thank you for your attention to this important issue and for your ongoing dedication to building global support for eliminating plastic pollution. We welcome further engagement with you on this topic, and the lead co-signers are available to meet with you at a mutually agreeable time prior to the INC-4 negotiations in April.",Congress

96,April 18,Jared Huffman,D,Calif.-2,"Huffman, Booker, Merkley, Introduce Legislation to Address Plastic Production Crisis","Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Representative Jared Huffman (CA-02) and Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Jeff Merkley (D-OR) re-introduced the Protecting Communities from Plastics Act, legislation that addresses the plastic production crisis that is fueling climate change and worsening environmental injustice. The reintroduction comes just before the 54th annual Earth Day, the official 2024 theme for which is ""Planet vs. Plastics,” as well as the commencement next week of the fourth session of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee to develop an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution in Ottawa. As leaders meet to address the plastic pollution crisis on an international scale, the U.S. must continue to push for stronger legislation at home. “Plastic pollution has become so ubiquitous that it can be found in the deepest parts of our oceans, every corner of the earth, and even in our body tissue. We are at a crisis level, and the problem doesn’t start or end there. Frontline communities are facing the brunt of this massive environmental injustice through the entire plastics lifecycle, from being poisoned by pollution from petrochemical manufacturing process on the front end, to suffering the consequences of toxic waste on the back end,” said Rep. Huffman. “The only way to truly address this crisis is to tackle the problem at its source: reducing how much plastic is produced in the first place and moving our economy away from its overreliance on single-use plastic. The writing is on the wall for Big Oil's waning dirty-energy dominance – and we won’t let them continue their planet-killing pollution with plastics as a safety net.”   “The plastic pollution crisis is an urgent threat to our public and environmental health. Communities living near plastics facilities often suffer from exposure to harmful pollutants and increased long-term health complications,” said Senator Booker. “As we continue to tackle climate change and transition to a clean energy economy, fossil-based plastic production undermines our efforts to reduce our carbon emissions and address environmental injustice. This legislation will create nationwide targets for single-use plastic source reduction and pause the permitting of new and expanded plastics facilities while the EPA makes much-needed regulatory updates.” “When it comes to reducing waste, we are taught the three Rs: reduce, reuse, and recycle. However, the reality for plastics is really the three Bs: buried, burned, or borne out to sea—which means dangerous chemicals are seeping into our soil, air, and water. This is a public health emergency for Americans everywhere, and disproportionately impacts communities of color and low-wealth communities,” said Senator Merkley, who serves as the Chair of the Environment and Public Works subcommittee overseeing environmental justice and chemical safety. “With plastic particles ending up on the snowcaps of the Arctic and inside our own bloodstreams, it’s clear we need strong legislation like the Protecting Communities from Plastics Act to get the plastics crisis under control. I will continue to work alongside my colleagues to get these solutions signed into law.” With plastic production and consumption on track to double in the next decade, the resulting greenhouse gas emissions threaten to put our climate goals further out of reach, while expanded plastic production will drive more pollution in environmental justice communities around the United States. Petrochemical, plastic production, and waste incineration facilities, which are disproportionately located in or near Black, Brown, and low-income communities, release harmful air and water pollution that cause increased incidences of asthma, cancers, endocrine disruption, development disorders, and heart disease. Transitioning off of fossil fuels only to replace that demand with more fossil-based plastic production is not a sustainable solution, and will continue to perpetuate existing climate and environmental justice impacts. The Protecting Communities from Plastics Act would: Rep. Huffman is a leader in Congress on combatting plastic pollution. This March, Huffman and Senator Jeff Merkley (D-OR) sent a letter to encourage U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken to push for decisive measures in addressing plastic production at the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC)’s current session. The lawmakers emphasized the imminent danger plastic poses to public health, national security, and the planet's future throughout its life-cycle and advocated for a vigorous stance in the negotiations. Ahead of next week’s INC4 conference, Huffman joined Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Member of the European Parliament Mohammed Chahim to U.S. President Joe Biden and United Nations officials to ramp up scrutiny of the petrochemical industry’s lobbying at global environmental conferences. Rep. Huffman has repeatedly led letters to the Biden administration to urge greater protections and rules to hold polluting industries accountable, including a letter with both former Rep. Alan Lowenthal and Sen. Cory Booker to the EPA calling on the agency to fully consider climate and environmental justice impacts of chemical recycling, or “advanced recycling” technologies in their rulemaking on those processes. Huffman, along with Merkley, leads the Break Free from Plastic Pollution Act, the most comprehensive plan ever introduced in Congress to address the plastic pollution crisis that is poisoning our air, water, and land, and disproportionately impacting communities of color and low-income Americans. The bill is cosponsored by U.S. Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), and Peter Welch (D-VT) and U.S. Representative Betty McCollum (MN-04).

97,April 18,Jared Huffman,D,Calif.-2,"Huffman, DeGette Applaud Biden Administration Finalization of Rule to Protect and Conserve Public Lands","Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Representatives Jared Huffman (CA-02) and Diana DeGette (CO-01) applauded the Biden Administration for finalizing the Conservation and Landscape Health rule. “Protecting public lands is so important to my constituents, to Californians, and to the millions of people who treasure the spectacular wild places our country has to offer. But all of those places are at risk from the escalating climate crisis and biodiversity loss,” said Representative Huffman. “Representative DeGette and I have been pushing for BLM to make addressing those crises at the forefront of their latest rulemaking, and I’m grateful to see the finalized rule meets that mark. With this move, the Biden-Harris administration is showing they will stand up for the will of the people and what’s best for the planet – not greedy polluters – so we can preserve public lands for future generations.” “The United States is home to some of the most beautiful landscapes in the world, and these public lands provide recreational opportunities, increase tourism, and support biodiversity. Beyond these impacts, public lands play an important role in mitigating the impact of climate change and improving the health of our planet,” said DeGette. “Today’s final rule is a significant accomplishment for land conservation and wildlife protection, and I am proud that BLM and the Biden Administration are continuing to lead in defending our natural world. Protecting public lands is good public policy, and I have been working in Congress to pass meaningful legislation that conserves public lands in Colorado and throughout the country. I will continue to ensure that even more public lands will be protected and enjoyed for generations to come.” The Conservation and Landscape Health rule provides tools for the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to improve the resilience of public lands in the face of a changing climate and biodiversity loss, conserve important wildlife habitat and intact landscapes, plan for development, and better recognize unique cultural and natural resources on public lands. The announcement from BLM follows sustained efforts by Reps. DeGette and Huffman to urge the Biden Administration to finalize this rule. BLM’s Public Lands Rule is nearly universally popular; a recent analysis found that 92% of public comments submitted on the proposed rule were supportive. The support for the rule reflects a broader sentiment about conservation and public lands among most Americans. In the West, for example, where the vast majority of BLM lands are located, 82% of voters across the political spectrum support a national goal of conserving America’s public lands and waters over the next decade.",Congress Progressive,"['washington today', 'representative jared huffman diana degette applauded biden administration finalizing conservation landscape health rule', 'protecting public land important constituent californian million people treasure spectacular wild place country offer', 'place risk escalating climate crisis biodiversity loss said representative huffman', 'representative degette pushing blm make addressing crisis forefront latest rulemaking grateful see finalized rule meet mark', 'move administration showing stand people best planet greedy polluter preserve public land future united state home beautiful landscape world public land provide recreational opportunity increase tourism support biodiversity', 'beyond impact public land play important role mitigating impact climate change improving health planet said degette', 'today final rule significant accomplishment land conservation wildlife protection proud blm biden administration continuing lead defending natural world', 'protecting public land good public policy working congress pas meaningful legislation conserve public land colorado throughout country', 'continue ensure even public land protected enjoyed generation conservation landscape health rule provides tool bureau land management blm improve resilience public land face changing climate biodiversity loss conserve important wildlife habitat intact landscape plan development better recognize unique cultural natural resource public land', 'announcement blm follows sustained effort degette huffman urge biden administration finalize rule', 'blm public land rule nearly universally popular recent analysis found public comment submitted proposed rule supportive', 'support rule reflects broader sentiment conservation public land among american', 'west example vast majority blm land located voter across political spectrum support national goal conserving america public land water next decade']",washington today representative jared huffman diana degette applauded biden administration finalizing conservation landscape health rule protecting public land important constituent californian million people treasure spectacular wild place country offer place risk escalating climate crisis biodiversity loss said representative huffman representative degette pushing blm make addressing crisis forefront latest rulemaking grateful see finalized rule meet mark move administration showing stand people best planet greedy polluter preserve public land future united state home beautiful landscape world public land provide recreational opportunity increase tourism support biodiversity beyond impact public land play important role mitigating impact climate change improving health planet said degette today final rule significant accomplishment land conservation wildlife protection proud blm biden administration continuing lead defending natural world protecting public land good public policy working congress pas meaningful legislation conserve public land colorado throughout country continue ensure even public land protected enjoyed generation conservation landscape health rule provides tool bureau land management blm improve resilience public land face changing climate biodiversity loss conserve important wildlife habitat intact landscape plan development better recognize unique cultural natural resource public land announcement blm follows sustained effort degette huffman urge biden administration finalize rule blm public land rule nearly universally popular recent analysis found public comment submitted proposed rule supportive support rule reflects broader sentiment conservation public land among american west example vast majority blm land located voter across political spectrum support national goal conserving america public land water next decade
98,April 18,Jared Huffman,D,Calif.-2,"Huffman, Padilla Lead Call for Administration to Declare Emergency","Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Representative Jared Huffman (D-San Rafael) and U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-CA) led 19 of their colleagues in an urgent letter to President Joe Biden and Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo calling for them to swiftly declare a federal fishery disaster, joining California Governor Gavin Newsom in his request. This follows the Pacific Fishery Management Council’s stark recommendation to implement a complete closure of California’s commercial and recreational ocean salmon season for the second consecutive year, expected to take effect in May 2024. If granted, the relief would provide necessary assistance for communities grappling with the challenges of the ongoing crisis. “The unprecedented back-to-back closures of the entire California salmon fishery is a devastating crisis. It remains unclear how long the salmon fishery will need to be closed, and we know there is much work ahead of us. The long-term solutions will include improving our drought resiliency, restoring salmon habitat, and of course, addressing the climate crisis. We look forward to continuing our work with your administration on these goals,” the members said in their letter.  “However, Californians who depend on the fishery, and are still trying to recover from last season’s closure, have no time to wait for these long-term objectives to be achieved. A federal fishery disaster declaration will help our commercial and charter fisheries, tribes, and communities survive the difficult times ahead,” the members concluded.  In April 2023, Huffman, Padilla, and Panetta led their colleagues in an urgent letter to President Joe Biden and Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, calling for them to swiftly declare a federal fishery disaster for the 2023 salmon season. Earlier that month, Rep. Huffman held a press conference with Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, Representative Kevin Mullin, and fishing industry stakeholders to call attention to this disaster and highlight the people who will bear the brunt of the impacts of closing the salmon season. In addition to regular engagement with NOAA, Rep. Huffman held a call directly with NOAA Administrator Dr. Rick Spinrad to continue the pressure and encourage him to prompt action. As part of his long-standing efforts to improve disaster relief for fisheries, Congressman Huffman was able to help secure an additional $300 million for fishery disaster declarations Fiscal Year 2023 Omnibus Appropriations bill. Congress also authorized new bipartisan fishery disaster relief language based on Congressman Jared Huffman and Senator Roger Wicker’s Fishery Resource Disasters Improvement Act. This language streamlines the process for declaring a federal fishery disaster and helps to quickly provide relief to affected communities. It also extends eligibility for federal fishery disaster funds not only to commercial fisheries, but also to charter fishing businesses and impacted tribes. In addition to Representative Huffman and Senator Padilla, the letter was signed by Senator Laphonza Butler (D-CA) and Representatives Nanette Barragán (CA-44), Ami Bera (CA-06), Salud Carbajal (CA-24), Jim Costa (CA-21), Mark DeSaulnier (CA-10), Anna Eshoo (CA-16), John Garamendi (CA-08), Josh Harder (CA-09), Sydney Kamlager-Dove (CA-37), Zoe Lofgren (CA-18), Doris Matsui (CA-07), Kevin Mullin (CA-15), Jimmy Panetta (CA-19), Nancy Pelosi (CA-11), Katie Porter (CA-47), Raul Ruiz (CA-25), Eric Swalwell (CA-14), and Mike Thompson (CA-04).

Click here to view a recording of the press event Following significant engagement with the public, Alaska Native Tribes, and Alaska Native Corporations, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) finalized the Management and Protection of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska (NPR-A) rule that will ensure maximum protection for significant resource values on the more than 13 million acres of Special Areas in the western Arctic, while supporting subsistence uses and needs for Alaska Native communities. The BLM is also announcing that it will publish a Request for Information in the coming weeks to solicit public comment on whether to consider adding resource values to existing Special Areas, expanding Special Areas, or creating new Special Areas within the NPR-A. Management and Protection of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska Rule Under the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act (NPRPA) of 1976, as amended, Congress directed the BLM to balance oil and gas development with the management and protection of significant resource values in locations known as Special Areas and mitigate impacts of oil and gas activities on surface resources across the reserve. The final rule updates the existing regulatory framework, adopted more than 40 years ago, allowing the BLM to more effectively respond to changing conditions in the NPR-A, while striking a balance between oil and gas development and the management and protection of surface values, including wildlife habitat vital to subsistence. Extending from the northwest slope of the Brooks Range to the Arctic Coast, the NPR-A encompasses roughly 23 million acres of public land managed by the BLM. Tribal Nations have occupied lands now within the NPR-A since time immemorial, and more than 40 Indigenous communities continue to rely on the resources from the Reserve for subsistence, harvesting caribou, shore and waterbirds, and many other fish and wildlife species. Many communities subsist primarily on food that, in turn, relies on the Special Areas of the NPR-A. Natural conditions in the Arctic are changing rapidly due to climate change, which is affecting caribou movement and herd health, causing degradation of permafrost, and altering habitats for wildlife, migratory birds, and native plants throughout the NPR-A. The final rule codifies protections for 13.3 million acres encompassed by the existing Special Areas, limiting future oil and gas leasing and industrial development in the Teshekpuk Lake, Utukok Uplands, Colville River, Kasegaluk Lagoon, and Peard Bay Special Areas – places collectively known for their globally significant intact habitat for wildlife, including grizzly and polar bears, caribou and hundreds of thousands of migratory birds. The rule also codifies existing prohibitions on new leasing in 10.6 million acres, more than 40 percent of the NPR-A, consistent with the current NPR-A Integrated Activity Plan (IAP). Congressman Jared Huffman’s Remarks Thank you, Abby. And hello, everyone. I am Congressman Jared Huffman from the beautiful north coast of California. For those who follow my work in the Congress, you know that I spend a lot of my time working to protect Alaska's wilderness or the people and wildlife that call it home. I want to issue a big thank you to LCV, to Arc Initiatives and everybody joining the call today to talk about this really great news with the unbelievable chaos that Team Extreme, the Republican conference in the House is causing with their limited time in the majority. It sure is nice to be able to celebrate something positive, something meaningful like this in an otherwise dysfunctional Congress. I am a climate hawk, and so what that means is I want to take bold climate action at every opportunity. I'm never going to really be fully satisfied until we get the atmosphere stabilized so that future generations can live on this planet. I won't live to see that. But I want to do as much as I can to put us on that path. And I think we need to give a lot of credit to the Biden administration, the Biden-Harris administration, for the historic climate action that they have made, the progress they made over the past three plus years. Democrats have been working to take actions that previously were unthinkable just a few short years ago when Republicans were screaming from the rooftops that climate change wasn't even real, that we should just drill, baby, drill. I want everyone to really appreciate how big this latest rulemaking from the Department of Interior is. 13 million acres of the Western Arctic now protected. That is record breaking. It is a huge step forward in our ongoing climate and conservation efforts. Not only does it codify existing prohibitions on new leasing in more than 40% of the NPR-A, but it provides greater clarity guidelines to ensure that development protects vital resources for subsistence while honoring existing rights. That's going to help BLM effectively fulfill its obligation to tribal nations. It's hard to find adequate words to describe how special and pristine this place is that we're talking about. The Western Arctic is ground zero for climate change. Every inch of land, water, permafrost holds on to carbon. And so, letting the fossil fuel industry desecrate this place for their dirty energy agenda would wreak absolute havoc on wildlife, native communities, and our climate. These Big Oil barons have tried to find, tried to claim every ounce of oil and gas in the Arctic, regardless of the consequences to our planet and those who live on this land or near this land. And this role is an important step for us to say no, finally, to say no to them, no more plundering our public lands, no more destroying indigenous people's way of life by wringing dry the ecosystems they've relied on since time immemorial. There is still a lot more work that we need to do to protect more of the Western Arctic and to create more permanent protections in other pristine places. We need to continue to put People over Polluters when we make these decisions. But we're fighting back at every turn to protect the Arctic, and we're going to keep doing that. We're going to continue to build on this great progress. And we are making great strides here. So, this is a moment to celebrate and appreciate for sure. More to come.

100,April 18,Alex Mooney,R,W.Va.-2,Congressman Mooney Introduces the “Protecting Life in Health Savings Accounts Act”,"
18 Apr.
 WASHINGTON, DC – Today, Congressman Alex X. Mooney reintroduced the Protecting Life in Health Savings Accounts Act (H.R 8049). This legislation would end the preferential tax treatment of abortion by prohibiting the life-taking procedure from being counted as an eligible medical procedure and exclude elective abortions from being paid for out of various types of health savings accounts. Abortion is not health care and should not be considered a medical expense. Seven House Republicans joined the bill as original cosponsors: Reps. Matt Rosendale, Jeff Duncan, Mary Miller, Dan Crenshaw, Paul Gosar, Bob Good, and Daniel Webster. Senator Mike Lee introduced this legislation in the Senate. “The sanctity of life continues to be under assault by President Joe Biden’s Administration. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has made it easier to acquire abortion pills by mail. Post offices are being converted into local abortion clinics. The radical pro-abortion movement is doing anything they can to keep access to abortion as easy and frequent as possible,” said Congressman Alex X. Mooney. “Protecting life is one of my top priorities in Congress. Abortion should not be paid for by the taxpayer and should not hold any special privileges when it comes to tax incentives,” Mooney added. Background: Federal law allows individuals to use tax-advantaged funds in health savings accounts (HSAs), flexible savings accounts (FSAs), health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs), Archer medical savings accounts (MSAs), and retiree health accounts to cover their medical expenses. These accounts allow users to set aside money on a pre-tax basis to pay for qualified medical expenses. These accounts can help pay for deductibles, copays, and medical procedures. Unfortunately, the IRS categorizes elective abortions as an eligible medical expense to be paid using these tax-advantaged savings accounts. The Protecting Life in Health Savings Accounts is the House companion to legislation introduced by Senator Mike Lee of Utah in the United States Senate.

Mark Takano (CA-39), a Congressional leader on LGBTQ and education issues, hailed the finalized rule on Title IX from the U.S. Department of Education and Biden Administration: The Education Department and Biden Administration showed real courage today, delivering on a long-held promise to ensure that the federal government does more to protect all Americans—especially LGBTQ Americans—from discrimination.  This groundbreaking rule is a major victory, but we still have much to do. We need to enshrine and expand its protections by passing the Equality Act because for too many Americans, their rights and protections depend on the zip code they live in.?? Background on Takano: ·         LGBTQ: First openly gay person of color elected to Congress and author of the Equality Act, which would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to extend non-discrimination protections to the LGBTQ community ·         Education: Former teacher and Senior Member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. ###",Congress Progressive,"['washington mark takano congressional leader lgbtq education issue hailed finalized rule title ix department education biden administration education department biden administration showed real courage today delivering promise ensure federal government protect lgbtq discrimination', 'groundbreaking rule major victory still much', 'need enshrine expand protection passing equality act many american right protection depend zip code live', 'background takano lgbtq first openly gay person color elected congress author equality act would amend civil right act extend protection lgbtq community education former teacher senior member house committee education workforce', '']",washington mark takano congressional leader lgbtq education issue hailed finalized rule title ix department education biden administration education department biden administration showed real courage today delivering promise ensure federal government protect lgbtq discrimination groundbreaking rule major victory still much need enshrine expand protection passing equality act many american right protection depend zip code live background takano lgbtq first openly gay person color elected congress author equality act would amend civil right act extend protection lgbtq community education former teacher senior member house committee education workforce
102,April 16,Greg Landsman,D,Ohio-1,Landsman Announces Opening of Community Project Funding Process,"PASSPORT ASSISTANCE Cincinnati, OH – Today, Congressman Greg Landsman (OH-01) announced the opening of his Fiscal Year 2025 federal Community Project Funding process. Each year, members of Congress can submit up to 15 local, community-led projects to the House Appropriations Committee for consideration to receive specialized federal funding through the appropriations bills that Congress passes annually to fund the federal government. The Community Project Funding process allows members of Congress to work closely with community partners – including local and state governmental entities and certain non-profit entities – to identify projects of regional importance and deploy significant federal funding that will benefit the community as a whole. Congressman Landsman will receive Community Project Funding applications and then select 15 projects to submit to the House Appropriations Committee to be considered. While the 15 projects Congressman Landsman submits to the House Appropriations Committee are not guaranteed to receive Community Project Funding, he will work with community partners in a transparent and bipartisan manner to submit projects that have the greatest likelihood of being approved by the House Appropriations Committee for Community Project Funding. During the last Fiscal Year 2024 Community Project Funding process, Congressman Landsman secured more than $15 million for 15 Southwest Ohio projects. Projects eligible for Community Project Funding include, but are not limited to: Congressman Landsman: “The Community Project Funding process is a district game-changer for our community leaders who receive funding to work on important projects for their communities. It’s our job to help them through this process and last year, we brought home $15 million for 15 incredible initiatives. We’re working this year to bring even more of your tax dollars home to better the lives of children and families in Southwest Ohio.” All information on the Fiscal Year 2025 Community Project Funding process can be found at https://landsman.house.gov/fy2025-community-project-funding-and-appropriations-requests. ### Cincinnati, OH – Today, Congressman Greg Landsman (OH-01) announced the winner of the 2024 OH-01 Congressional Art Competition.

103,April 16,Nikki Budzinski,D,Ill.-13,"Budzinski, Bost Announce $10.3 Million Navy Contract for the Belleville Shoe Manufacturing Company","WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, Representatives Nikki Budzinski (IL-13) and Mike Bost (IL-12) announced that the Belleville Shoe Manufacturing Company has been awarded a $10,334,376 contract from the Defense Logistics Agency to make flight deck safety boots for the U.S. Navy. Last year, Budzinski announced a $7.8 million contract with the U.S. Army.  “The Belleville Shoe Manufacturing Company has played a critical role in equipping the men and women serving our nation in the armed forces since World War II,” said Congresswoman Budzinski. “I’m thrilled to announce a $10.3 million contract that will allow Belleville Boots to produce flight deck safety boots for the U.S. Navy. I’ve been glad to work on a bipartisan basis with Congressman Bost to support domestic military equipment manufacturing and I look forward to continuing to support the important manufacturing work happening in the Metro East.” “Belleville Boots is a proud Metro East company that generates local jobs and ensures our military men and women have the quality footwear they need to complete their mission. As a Marine, the father of a Marine, and the grandfather of a Marine, I was proud to help ensure that Belleville Boots remains an integral part of our local economy,” said Congressman Bost.  “Belleville Boot Company is thrilled to have been awarded a Defense Logistics Agency contract option worth $10.3M for the Navy Flight Deck and General-Purpose Safety boot. Our company is committed to producing the highest quality boots for the Navy, and we are excited about this opportunity to continue serving the sailors. We have a special connection to this particular boot, as we led the research and development, testing, and initial fielding efforts for this upgraded safety boot. These boots are worn by the all-important Aircraft Carrier Flight Deck crews who maintain, arm, launch, and recover aircraft, as well as the sailors across the Navy,” said Mark Ferguson, President of the Belleville Shoe Manufacturing Company. The Belleville Shoe Manufacturing Company is the oldest and leading manufacturer of boots for the U.S. Military – beginning with their first combat boot supply order during WWI. Belleville Boot supplies the largest selection of certified boots to the U.S. Military and develops an assortment of styles to meet specialized needs. Representatives Budzinski and Bost successfully included a bipartisan amendment to the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act to require the Department of Defense to examine current military footwear regulations and provide recommendations on improvements to support the footwear needs of our troops. This provision aims to support domestic military-grade boot manufacturing, like that done by Belleville Shoe Manufacturing Company. This provision also ensures that military footwear complies with the standards that military members need as large companies increasingly move into military boot manufacturing. ### Submissions are due by October 24th, 11:00 a.m. CT SPRINGFIELD, IL — Today, Congresswoman Nikki Budzinski (IL-13) announced the start of the 2024 Congressional App Challenge for middle and high school students in Illinois’ 13th Congressional District.

104,April 16,Nikki Budzinski,D,Ill.-13,Budzinski Continues Call on President Biden to Make Springfield Race Riot Site a National Monument,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, Congresswoman Nikki Budzinski (IL-13) joined Monuments for All for a press conference in front of the U.S. Capitol to continue her call for President Biden to invoke the Antiquities Act to recognize the site of the 1908 Springfield Race Riot as a national monument. Budzinski led a letter to the President in December requesting formal designation of the site by the administration. WATCH: Budzinski Calls on President Biden to Make Springfield Race Riot Site a National Monument WATCH: Budzinski Calls on President Biden to Make Springfield Race Riot Site a National Monument “The 1908 Springfield Race Riot is an example of our nation’s deep history of racial violence – it’s also the story of strength and resilience that led to the creation of the NAACP and the fight for civil rights,” said Congresswoman Budzinski. “Since coming to Congress, I’ve been pushing for our history to be appropriately recognized by introducing bipartisan legislation to designate the site of the 1908 Springfield Race Riot as a national monument, and by leading the Illinois congressional delegation in a request for President Biden to memorialize the site by invoking the Antiquities Act. Today, I was glad to continue calling on the White House to take action and honor Springfield’s important role in the Civil Rights Movement.” During the 1908 Springfield Race Riot, a mob of white residents attacked Springfield’s Black community, burning down homes and businesses and attacking hundreds of residents for no other reason than the color of their skin. In the aftermath of the riot, the NAACP was formed. During an excavation as part of the Springfield Rail Improvements Project, foundations and artifacts from homes destroyed during the riot were uncovered. An agreement with community members was reached in 2018 to excavate the remains and designate the uncovered site a memorial. One of the first bills introduced by Congresswoman Budzinski during her first term was bipartisan legislation with Congressman Darin LaHood and Senators Tammy Duckworth and Dick Durbin to recognize the significance of this tragedy with a national monument. Budzinski has also been working with the Biden-Harris administration in an effort to secure a national monument designation through the President’s authority under the Antiquities Act.  WATCH: Budzinski Calls on President Biden to Make Springfield Race Riot Site a National Monument ### Submissions are due by October 24th, 11:00 a.m. CT SPRINGFIELD, IL — Today, Congresswoman Nikki Budzinski (IL-13) announced the start of the 2024 Congressional App Challenge for middle and high school students in Illinois’ 13th Congressional District.

106,April 17,Nikki Budzinski,D,Ill.-13,Budzinski Introduces Bipartisan Bill to Halt USPS Processing Facility Consolidations,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Representatives Nikki Budzinski (D-IL-13) and Jack Bergman (R-MI-01) introduced the Protect Postal Performance Act – bipartisan legislation to halt plans to consolidate U.S. Postal Service (USPS) Processing and Distribution Centers (P&DCs) if they are located in underperforming postal districts. Facilities in Champaign and Springfield have been recommended for downsizing despite the region’s dismal on-time-delivery rates.  “Postmaster DeJoy has no business reducing mail processing capacity in areas that are already short staffed and struggling to receive mail on time. Today, I introduced bipartisan legislation that will halt these plans in Champaign and Springfield, and in underserviced areas across the country,”said Congresswoman Budzinski. “I’m grateful to Congressman Jack Bergman for joining me in this important effort to protect local USPS jobs and push back on a misguided effort that could further impact poor postal delivery rates in our communities.” “Bureaucrats in the U.S. Postal Service seem to have this misperception that they understand the delivery needs of the Upper Peninsula’s rural communities more than the people actually living there. My constituents rely on the Postal Service for the timely delivery of bills, payments, prescriptions, and other necessities, and they deserve a functional mail service, absent of manufactured delays caused by bureaucratic ineptitude. I thank my colleague, Congresswoman Nikki Budzinski, for co-leading this critical bill – the Protect Postal Performance Act – to halt the Postal Service’s ill-conceived consolidation plans in areas where the agency is already underperforming,” said Congressman Bergman.  Congresswoman Budzinski and Congresswoman Mary Miller (R-IL-15) have sent two letters to Postmaster General Louis DeJoy raising serious concerns about USPS plans to downsize the Champaign and Springfield Processing and Distribution Centers. The plans could mean worse delivery rates and the relocation of dozens of jobs to the Chicago and St. Louis areas. Budzinski also joined a letter with Senator Durbin, Senator Duckworth and other members of the Illinois delegation with concerns about what the USPS plans could mean for mail delivery across the state. Budzinski’s Protect Postal Performance Act would bar the USPS from considering facility downsizing in regions that aren’t meeting the USPS delivery targets of 90.3% on-time delivery for three to five-day first-class mail and 93% on-time delivery for two-day first-class mail. Downstate Illinois currently experiences a 64.2% on-time delivery rate for three-to-five-day delivery options and an 84.7% on-time delivery rate for two-day mail.  Full text of the Protect Postal Performance Act can be found here. ### Submissions are due by October 24th, 11:00 a.m. CT SPRINGFIELD, IL — Today, Congresswoman Nikki Budzinski (IL-13) announced the start of the 2024 Congressional App Challenge for middle and high school students in Illinois’ 13th Congressional District.

107,April 17,Nikki Budzinski,D,Ill.-13,Budzinski Calls on House GOP to Preserve the Affordable Connectivity Program,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Representatives Nikki Budzinski (IL-13) and Angie Craig (MN-02) held a press conference in front of the U.S. Capitol as they led 95 New Democrat Coalition colleagues in a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson calling for immediate bipartisan action to fund the Affordable Connectivity Program. The American Rescue Plan created the Emergency Broadband Benefit, which provides discounted or free broadband for low-income households. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law expanded the program into the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), which provides a discount of up to $30 a month for qualifying low-income households. The ACP currently empowers 23 million households across the country to access affordable broadband. Without additional funding from Congress, the ACP will run out of funding, and millions of households could lose crucial internet access.  “When voters sent me to Washington, they tasked me with fighting to bring down the everyday costs that are holding too many working families back. That’s what the Affordable Connectivity Program is all about,” said Congresswoman Budzinski. “The ACP ensures that lower-income households can afford access to high-speed internet for work, school, health care and more. In 2024, access to the internet isn’t a luxury, it’s a necessity. Since the ACP was launched, more than 17 million households across the country have received support. In the district I serve, more than 75,000 households have subscribed to the Affordable Connectivity Program. And it’s saving families in my district nearly $40 million a year. I held a roundtable in East St. Louis where nearly every household benefits from the ACP. I heard about what this program has meant for students, for families, for workers, for patients. But this is all at risk if the ACP expires at the end of this month. My office has heard from more than 9,000 constituents who would be hurt by a disruption to this program. If Congress allows the ACP to lapse, internet services for millions of Americans could be disrupted. I’m proud to be here today to urge GOP leadership to maintain this critical program for families in my district and across the country.”  The letter Budzinski and Craig sent to Speaker Johnson reads in part: “As New Dems, we are committed to fighting to lower everyday costs for Americans; letting the ACP lapse will lead to a direct increase in broadband costs for consumers. We reaffirm our call to House Republicans to deliver for the American people and provide the ACP with the funding it needs without delay.” Full text of the letter can be found here and below: Dear Speaker Johnson, In the nearly three years since the establishment of the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, millions of American households have received aid from the ACP to access affordable broadband and participate in the 21st century economy. Without the monthly benefit the ACP provides, many Americans will lose access to distance learning, telemedicine, the online marketplace, and the numerous benefits that high-speed internet provides in everyday life. We are disappointed that despite the incredible impact on the 23 million households that have enrolled across the country, House Republican Leadership has blocked any consideration of the funding it needs to keep running, pushing us towards the program’s extinction. At a time of rising costs, Republican Leadership refuses to support this critical program that saves communities money. If Congress does not provide additional funding, April is the last month the full ACP benefit will be provided, and, in May, households will see changes in their bill. More than three-quarters of ACP-enrolled households could either experience a disruption or lose access to the internet entirely. We cannot let this happen. As New Dems, we are committed to fighting to lower everyday costs for Americans; letting the ACP lapse will lead to a direct increase in broadband costs for consumers. We reaffirm our call to House Republicans to deliver for the American people and provide the ACP with the funding it needs without delay. In January 2024, the bipartisan, bicameral Affordable Connectivity Program Extension Act was introduced, and, if adopted, would provide an additional $7 billion for the ACP.  This Act has broad support, including over 224 co-sponsors. We stand ready and willing to partner with you and the Republican Conference to keep Americans connected to the internet. ### Submissions are due by October 24th, 11:00 a.m. CT SPRINGFIELD, IL — Today, Congresswoman Nikki Budzinski (IL-13) announced the start of the 2024 Congressional App Challenge for middle and high school students in Illinois’ 13th Congressional District.

108,April 18,Nikki Budzinski,D,Ill.-13,Budzinski Introduces Bipartisan Legislation to Address Gap in EPA’s Year-Round E15 Rule,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — This week, U.S. Representatives Nikki Budzinski (IL-13) and Zach Nunn (IA-03) introduced bipartisan legislation to address a gap in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s recently finalized rule allowing for the sale of year-round E15 in eight midwestern states beginning in 2025. The Year-Round E15 Act would ensure that E15 sales can begin this year. The bipartisan legislation is co-led by U.S. Representatives Adrian Smith (NE-03), Brad Finstad (MN-01), Eric Sorensen (IL-17) and Don Bacon (NE-02). “Biofuels bring down fuel costs, reduce our dependence on foreign oil, cut carbon emissions and support critical markets for Illinois’ family farmers,” said Congresswoman Budzinski. “I was glad to see the Environmental Protection Agency take evidence-based action to allow the permanent sale of E15 in Illinois and across the Midwest, but this long-awaited action doesn’t take effect until 2025. Today, I’m proud to introduce bipartisan legislation with my friend, Congressman Zach Nunn, that will address this gap and allow for the sale of cheaper, cleaner fuel for Heartland consumers this summer.”  “Since day one, I’ve been fighting for year-round E15. Unfortunately, this Administration has repeatedly put America’s producers and families behind as they stubbornly opposed E15, which is good for the economy, good for the climate, and good for families,” said Congressman Nunn. “This bill wouldn’t be necessary if the Administration had just done the right thing to begin with, but this is a critical step to provide certainty for farmers, producers, and families who will benefit from less expensive fuel.”  In February, the Environmental Protection Agency finalized a rule in February that allows eight midwestern states to sell E15 year-round beginning in April of 2025. The rule applies to Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin. Budzinski released a statement praising the rule and calling for action to allow E15 sales for the 2024 summer driving season and secure permanent E15 sales under the law by passing legislation like the Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act. As a member of the House Committee on Agriculture, Congresswoman Budzinski has established herself as a bipartisan leader in supporting biofuels production and family farmers across Central and Southern Illinois. Her Next Generation Fuels Act, Sustainable Aviation Fuels Accuracy Act and Fuels Parity Act would take significant steps to support the future of homegrown biofuels. Additional information on Budzinski’s biofuels legislation can be found below:  Full text of the Year-Round E15 Act can be found here.   ### Submissions are due by October 24th, 11:00 a.m. CT SPRINGFIELD, IL — Today, Congresswoman Nikki Budzinski (IL-13) announced the start of the 2024 Congressional App Challenge for middle and high school students in Illinois’ 13th Congressional District.

109,April 17,Michael Cloud,R,Tex.-27,RELEASE: Rep. Cloud Calls on White House to Remove Ban on LNG,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Last week, Rep. Michael Cloud (R-TX) supported a letter calling on President Biden to lift his ban on Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) exports, an issue critical to the South Texas energy sector, as part of deliberations over how Congress should deal with the fallout of the Francis Scott Key Bridge accident.   In January of this year, President Biden’s White House issued an indefinite ban on the issuance of LNG exports to non-Free Trade agreement countries — and announced no timeline for the end of the ban while the administration reviews “climate change” impacts. The ban has had tremendously negative impacts, not only on South Texas, but on the whole U.S. energy industry, with detrimental effects on job creation and economic opportunity in communities who need it. Furthermore, the lack of a clear timeline from the White House has created significant uncertainty for employers and energy providers, making a bad situation worse. In the wake of the recent Francis Scott Key Bridge tragedy, the conservative House Freedom Caucus has been evaluating ways Congress could assist in rebuilding the bridge while lessening the burden on taxpayers and minimizing the negative fallout of having a major port under construction. One of the proposed solutions, included in a letter sent from the Freedom Caucus to House leadership, proposed that the House require Biden to lift his LNG export ban before Congress appropriates funds for the bridge repairs. The Freedom Caucus letter states that “the Biden Administration’s pause on approvals of liquified natural gas export terminals — which, like the Baltimore harbor closure, has severe implications for foreign trade – must be lifted before Congress considers appropriating any funding for the bridge reconstruction.” Rep. Cloud released the following statement on the letter and his advocacy for Biden to lift his LNG ban: “Everyday President Biden is waging an economic war on our own country by hamstringing the wealth of resources we have at our disposal. This is having untold negative impacts on American workers, businesses, and energy providers — all in pursuit of the left’s futile climate change agenda, where even in a best-case scenario, the average American would receive minimal benefit at a tremendously high cost. The President’s ban on LNG exports was a bad decision with painful consequences – impacting my district and the whole country’s energy sector — and while we can’t afford this kind of self-inflicted damage on a given day, we especially can’t afford it with inflation still rising, the border in ruin, and a major harbor in shambles after a tragic accident. Biden needs to change course. That’s why my Freedom Caucus colleagues and I are pressuring the President on this issue, and why the President should lift his LNG export ban immediately. We should be looking for ways to relieve American taxpayers of their burden — not worsening it with a partisan political agenda from the left. Mr. President, it’s time to unlock the American energy industry and let them do their jobs.” To read the full text of the letter, click HERE. ### Today, Rep. Michael Cloud (R-TX) released the following statement regarding his vote in favor of tabling a motion to vacate Speaker Mike Johnson: Rep.

110,April 17,Michael Cloud,R,Tex.-27,"RELEASE: Rep. Cloud Expresses Support for Israel, Aid Package with Offsets","WASHINGTON, D.C. — Following attacks on our ally Israel this past weekend, Rep. Cloud again expressed his support for the Israeli people and Jewish community at home in the U.S. On Saturday, it was reported that Iran had fired hundreds of missiles and drones toward Israel, though fortunately, the vast majority were intercepted by Israeli Defense Forces. This week, House leadership has indicated it will consider another aid package for Israel given the urgency after the attack. Rep. Cloud has previously supported aid for Israel and voted for the bipartisan H.R. 6126, the Israel Security Supplemental Appropriations Act, which included full offsets of government spending. Cloud has joined his conservative colleagues in the House Freedom Caucus in pressing House Leadership not to use the emergency situation Israel as a means of jamming through more unrelated aid on Ukraine, particularly without action on serious southern border security first. Rep. Cloud released the following statement: “My heart is heavy for the ongoing turmoil in the Middle East and I want to reiterate my prayers for peace. Israel has the right to defend itself and its people, and even though varying degrees of conflict in the Middle East have covered generations, since Hamas’ brutal and unprovoked attack on October 7, Israel has been in a unique danger coming from all sides. Sadly, this reached a boiling point on Saturday when Iran launched a direct attack using missiles and drones — especially unprecedented after years of waging war on the Israeli people through proxies. This cannot stand. Unfortunately, President Biden has continued to show a disturbing lack of leadership on this issue — not only choosing to isolate Israel with blame at a time when they are under attack, but also choosing to leverage the war in Israel as a means of spending more taxpayer funds in Ukraine. This would be unacceptable. As House conservatives have said, the Senate and President Biden should immediately take up and support the Israel aid package already passed by the House, with offsets, showing support for our ally at a critical juncture with no more burden to the taxpayer. Don’t play Ukrainian politics with Israel aid.”  To see the latest Freedom Caucus statement referenced earlier, click HERE. ### Today, Rep.

111,April 19,Michael Cloud,R,Tex.-27,RELEASE: Rep. Cloud Opposes Rule on Foreign Aid Without Border Security,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — On Friday, Rep. Cloud voted NO on H.Res. 1160 — a rule to allow the House of Representatives to advance aid packages on Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan, but with no serious effort to provide border security. While Cloud joined 54 of his conservative colleagues in voting NO, ultimately, the rule passed 316-94. The rule passed with more Democrat support than that of Republicans — an extremely rare occurrence and a shocking deviation from usual procedure. 165 Democrats voted YES, while only 151 Republicans voted YES. This week, House Republican leadership announced their intention to pursue three bills — H.R. 8034, H.R. 8035, H.R. 8036, and H.R. 8038 — to provide aid to Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan, as well as something called a “sidecar” provision to implement a ban on TikTok, among other minor provisions. Conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus have been pushing Republican leadership to include serious border security measures within the combined rule, with the reason being that our government should put a priority on protecting our own southern border before sending money overseas. Additionally, because of the combined rule, if the House passed border security within the same rule, the Senate would be forced to combine both foreign aid and border security in order to advance the bill. Unfortunately, leadership chose to bifurcate the border security issue from the foreign aid package — meaning they separated the border bill into a separate vote, ensuring the border security measures would eventually die in the Senate. Now, the Senate can pass foreign aid without having to even consider the southern border. This amounts to what conservatives have criticized as “failure theatre,” only voting on things for political cover or messaging rather than in a serious effort to make law. There are also a number of grave concerns with the individual aid packages. For example, while the aid to Ukraine is structured as a “loan,” the bill gives the President extremely broad discretion to cancel 50% the debt after the November 2024 election, rendering it extremely unlikely that American taxpayers will ever see this money again. Furthermore, while Rep. Cloud has long supported military aid to our ally Israel, the bill providing Israel aid also includes $9 billion in aid to Gaza. There is overwhelming evidence that Hamas has stolen the vast majority of aid intended for innocent people in Gaza, and the bill contains little to no oversight mechanisms, meaning American taxpayers are essentially funding terrorists. This is completely unacceptable. Rep. Cloud introduced an amendment to give Israel coordination control over aid going into Gaza, as they have previously conducted much better oversight to ensure the aid goes to actual civilians, but House leadership rejected the amendment. Rep. Cloud released the following statement: “The uniparty is hard at work in Congress. My heart is heavy for our country, as I feel as though I’ve written the same thing over and over recently with the conduct of our government, but it is a sad day in America — and a stark reminder that the problems in Washington go well beyond one political party. Once again, Congress has failed to understand and work according to what should be our first priority: protecting our own country. Even as our own borders and our own people are suffering, House leadership just made it easier to send billions overseas without using valuable leverage we have to implement real border security. While I certainly understand the importance of helping innocent friends and allies in need, Congress should not be shipping billions overseas at the expense of the homeland. It’s wrong. My conservative colleagues and I are evaluating next steps, but we will not be giving up. While trust in leadership may be deeply broken, I will continue to fight for serious border security and for substantive change to Washington.” House leadership intends to vote on the aid packages on Saturday, April 20, after the rule advanced today. ### Today, Rep. Michael Cloud (R-TX) released the following statement regarding his vote in favor of tabling a motion to vacate Speaker Mike Johnson: Rep.

114,April 18,David Rouzer,R,N.C.-7,Rouzer Honors National Lineman Appreciation Day with Bipartisan Congressional Resolution,"WASHINGTON, DC - Today, Congressman David Rouzer (NC-07) introduced a bipartisan resolution to designate April 18, 2024, as National Lineman Appreciation Day and recognize the more than 115,000 hardworking men and women maintaining America’s electrical infrastructure. ""When natural disasters hit Southeastern North Carolina, it’s the brave lineworkers who operate in dangerous conditions to safely restore power and build our communities back as quickly as possible,"" said Congressman Rouzer.  ""These hard-working men and women deserve our thanks for navigating any obstacle with skill and determination to keep the lights on in communities across the country."" Cosponsored by twenty-six Members of Congress, the resolution highlights the critical work done by linemen to keep the public safe and protect our nation's power supply every day since the first transmission line was constructed in 1889. Electrical linemen work atop powerlines 24 hours a day, 365 days a year ensuring Americans can turn on their lights, run their businesses, and connect with loved ones.  They are not only installing new and replacing old powerlines, but our nation’s linemen serve as frontline responders to natural disasters, reconnecting Americans in the wake of storms, fires, floods.  During Hurricane Florence in 2018, more than 40,000 linemen mobilized to restore power to communities in Southeastern North Carolina. “Lineworkers are skilled professionals who rise to the challenge to perform difficult and dangerous work, at times in grueling conditions for long hours, all while adhering to strict safety protocols,” said ElectriCities of North Carolina CEO, Roy Jones.“Lineworkers prioritize the needs of their neighbors above their own to keep the lights on in the communities they serve. They are true hometown heroes, and I am proud to support this resolution and all efforts to recognize and celebrate the expertise, determination, and commitment lineworkers display every day.” ""We appreciate Congressman Rouzer's leadership on energy issues in Congress and his consistent recognition of the important role lineworkers play in the safe and efficient delivery of power across the country,” said Scott Batson, Duke Energy’s chief power grid officer. “Duke Energy is honored to employ more than 12,000 Duke Energy and contract lineworkers and technicians dedicated to not only the maintenance and repair of an essential component of the energy grid, but also public safety and community service in their communities - and other communities - when storms call them away from home."" ""Since 2012 to today the US Congress has honored the nation’s Linemen with a day of recognition and appreciation.  The US Senate in 2013 followed with a unanimous approval of National Lineman’s Appreciation Day, placing April 18th on the national calendar. April 18th originated as a day to honor linemen and the selfless dedication to the public and our nation’s electrical infrastructure. This day of recognition has occurred for 12 years, and the next step should be designating linemen as First Responders with the benefits that this title enjoys."" - Karen Bosch, Managing Director for National Association of Journeymen Linemen and Bill Bosch, Northwest Lineman College (Founders of National Lineman's Appreciation Day) This resolution supports the designation of April 18 as National Lineman Appreciation Day, recognizing the efforts and courage of linemen in keeping the power on and protecting public safety; the remarkable contributions to the approximately 155 million electricity customers in America; the personal, family, and professional tradition of the trade; and the lineman’s role as a first responder following natural disasters.

115,April 19,David Rouzer,R,N.C.-7,Judiciary Committee Approves Rouzer Legislation to Deter Asylum Abuse and Restore the Rule of Law,"WASHINGTON, DC - This week, the House Judiciary Committee approved legislation led by Congressman David Rouzer (NC-07) to crack down on those who abuse the current asylum law.  H.R. 3591, the Asylum Accountability Act improves the integrity of the asylum system by significantly sharpening the penalty for those who fail to appear at their immigration court hearing. “Criminals, cartels, and human traffickers have taken advantage of the Biden Administration’s open-border policies and turned the asylum process into a get-out-of-jail free card,"" said Congressman Rouzer.  ""I thank the Judiciary Committee for passing the Asylum Accountability Act, which would help deter asylum abuse by permanently barring legal status for work, permanent residence status, or citizenship for anyone who fails to show up in court for their asylum hearing."" Background:

The current surge of crossings at the U.S. southern border is driven by the Biden Administration’s policies that incentivize illegal immigration.  With the mass influx of individuals coming across, cartels and smugglers are exploiting our asylum laws to facilitate illegal entry. 

Under current law, an illegal immigrant who fails to appear for their immigration court hearing is deportable and banned from immigration benefits for ten years.  According to a recent Government Accountability Office study, nine percent of all illegal immigrants enrolled in Alternatives to Detention ultimately absconded.

The Asylum Accountability Act amends the penalty for absconding from an immigration court hearing to a permanent ban of benefits, including legal status or citizenship, under the Immigration and Nationality Act.

116,April 18,Scott Perry,R,Pa.-10,House GOP blasts ‘joke’ loan to Ukraine in latest blow to Johnson’s foreign aid plan,"Hard-line House Republicans are coming out in strong opposition to House Speaker Mike Johnson‘s (R-LA) four-pronged foreign aid package, particularly over a stipulation in the Ukraine aid bill that the loan can be canceled by the president in a few years — a move that some are calling a “joke.” Johnson’s long-awaited four-bill foreign aid package, for which text was released on Wednesday, includes aid to Ukraine, Israel, and the Indo-Pacific, all in separate bills. As part of the Ukraine bill, nearly $7.9 billion will be provided to Ukraine under the “Economic Support Fund,” and nearly $1.57 billion will be provided for “Assistance for Europe, Eurasia, and Central Asia” to Ukraine and other countries. A breakdown of the package from the speaker’s office and House Appropriations Committee touts Ukraine aid as a “loan” and says the legislation “mandates agreement on repayment for economic support by the government of Ukraine.” However, buried in the text is a section that stipulates that the president can cancel up to 50% of the loan after Nov. 15, 2024, with congressional review. After Jan. 1, 2026, any remaining debt can be canceled. The bill itself, as well as the loan repayment, angered some House GOP members who believe the United States won’t see any money return. “I think it’s a joke,” Rep. Tim Burchett (R-TN) said to the Washington Examiner. “They’re not gonna pay us any money. We’re gonna rebuild that country afterwards, probably, or part of it.” He added that he thinks several House Republicans are going to vote for the Ukraine bill and use the loan to “justify it.” Rep. Scott Perry (R-PA) said in a post to X that the loan for Ukraine is “all smoke and mirrors” and blasted the president’s ability to cancel 50% of the loan by this November, adding that “no bank would allow this.” The passage of Ukraine aid could cost Johnson his speakership, as Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) continues to hold her motion to vacate, which she filed last month, over his head. She previously said how Johnson handled Ukraine aid and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act reauthorization would dictate how she moves forward with the motion to vacate. “Monday was Tax Day. So as Americans were paying their hard-earned tax dollars to this government, the Republican speaker, hinging his entire ability to stay speaker on sending $64 million to Ukraine — I can’t think of a worse betrayal ever to happen in the United States history,” Greene told reporters on Thursday. The decision to include debt cancelation is a sign that House GOP leadership is putting some distance between the foreign aid package and former President Donald Trump’s demands over how to handle Ukraine aid, as it becomes more clear that Johnson needs bipartisan support to push his four-pronged plan over the finish line. Trump, who has shown several times his influence stretches over the House GOP, said during a meeting with Johnson last week that Republicans should push for making additional aid to Ukraine “in the form of a loan rather than a gift.” In a post to Truth Social on Thursday, he blasted the United States for its financial involvement in the country’s war against Russia compared to other nations. “Why isn’t Europe giving more money to help Ukraine? Why is it that the United States is over $100 Billion Dollars into the Ukraine War more than Europe, and we have an Ocean between us as separation! Why can’t Europe equalize or match the money put in by the United States of America in order to help a Country in desperate need?” the former president said. During a press conference on Wednesday, Johnson said that adding the loan forgiveness provision might be a “very important chip in a game” down the road, such as brokering a peace deal. “That might be an important thing to have, an important option for the president to have, and I think that makes sense to Republicans and Democrats,” Johnson said. “We would want the Commander-in-Chief to make those decisions, and then Congress, of course, has oversight over all of it, so I think it’s a good policy.” President Joe Biden came out in strong support for Johnson’s foreign aid package on Wednesday, calling on the House and Senate to pass the bills and stating he would sign it into law “immediately.” The ability to cancel up to 50% of the economic support loan to Ukraine is a win for Democrats and Biden, who has made loan cancellation for student debt a key component of his presidency and his reelection campaign. Just days after the election in November, Biden would be able to forgive half of the U.S.’s loan to Ukraine. Rep. Bob Good (R-VA) also called the loan forgiveness a “joke,” adding “it’s not real.” “First of all, the bill as it’s written gives Biden the ability to waive 50% of it anyway,” Good said to reporters on Wednesday. “This is the guy who wants to waive all student loans — why wouldn’t he waive Ukraine’s loan? And you know, we got a long list of nations who haven’t paid us back money that was supposedly loaned to them, so.” Some Republicans in the Senate are not too pleased with the framework of Johnson’s Ukraine aid bill, as well. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) told the Washington Examiner he thought the loan idea was a “little gimmicky.” “And maybe I don’t understand it well enough,” Hawley said. “So, I’ll try to do my homework here, but I don’t know — if they can repay the loan, would they be asking for the money? I mean, they’re not going to repay it.” “You may as well just call it what it is, which is an outlay. I mean, it’s just spending,” the Missouri senator added. “But, again, maybe I’m missing some profound nuance.” The Washington Examiner reached out to Trump for comment.",Freedom Party,"['house

117,April 16,Salud Carbajal,D,Calif.-24,"Rep. Carbajal Highlights Securing $1,000,000 Investment for New Housing Options, Health Clinic in Downtown Santa Barbara","

 Congressman Salud Carbajal (CA-24) visited the future site of more than 30 new apartments and a health clinic in downtown Santa Barbara to present Sanctuary Centers and the County of Santa Barbara with the $1,000,000 investment he secured in this year’s federal budget to support the project.
 ""This is an example of great partnerships in action helping to address the Central Coast’s greatest issues,” said Rep. Carbajal. “It tackles housing: 34 new affordable units for Central Coast families, which are much needed. It tackles health: creating a new clinic to address mental health, substance use, and other ailments. And it does both right in the heart of downtown Santa Barbara.”
 “Congressman Carbajal's decisive leadership in securing federal funding to support the construction of 34 units of affordable housing is a beacon of hope for Santa Barbara County,” said Sanctuary Centers President and CEO Barry Schoer. “This funding will have a profound impact on residents with mental illness who wish to live independently while receiving supportive behavioral health services.” “Having an 100% affordable project in the middle of downtown is vital and serves a real need for the many folks in our working class who are working to survive,” said Santa Barbara County Supervisor Das Williams. “We are grateful to Representative Carbajal for his support in securing the Community Project Funding grant to create housing units for the chronically mentally ill,” stated Jesús Armas, Director of the Santa Barbara County Community Services Department. “The residents will receive comprehensive services to address their ongoing mental health needs.  We also thank Barry Schoer and the Sanctuary Centers Board for their vision to expand critical housing and services for the County’s most vulnerable population.” The $1,000,000 in funding that Rep. Carbajal worked to secure in the 2024 federal budget signed into law last month supports the construction of 34 new studio apartments along with an on-site clinic at 115 West Anapamu Street in Santa Barbara. The clinic will give residents access to supportive services for those struggling with mental health, substance abuse, and other health concerns. The mixed-use development will also include 10 units set aside for 24/7 supportive care from the Sanctuary Centers team. Construction on the project began in December 2023. Additional funding for the project was provided by Santa Barbara County, the State of California, and private donations. The funding is part of $13,446,901 secured by Carbajal for 14 Central Coast projects which he championed over the course of the past year’s federal budget negotiations. The projects range from public safety and infrastructure upgrades to water system improvements. In the spring of 2023, Rep. Carbajal began to push for funding for these projects through formal requests to the House Appropriations Committee for Fiscal Year 2024. Rep. Carbajal has previously secured funding for 23 different community projects, totaling nearly $40 million over the past two years. The funding was secured through the Community Project Funding (CPF) initiative first launched in 2022. Projects must be in the public interest, be good uses of taxpayer dollars, and be certified to not conflict with the representative’s personal financial interests.

118,April 17,Salud Carbajal,D,Calif.-24,"Congressional Hispanic Caucus Endorses Rep. Carbajal’s Bipartisan Bill to Cut Child Care Costs, Boost Availability of Care","Today, Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) Chair Nanette Barragán (CA-44) announced the CHC endorsement of bipartisan legislation written by Congressman Salud Carbajal (CA-24) to increase access to quality child care and lower cost of care for American families. The Child Care Investment Act, which was introduced by Carbajal with Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer (R-OR) last summer, has the support of the Problem Solvers Caucus, the New Democrat Coalition, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Bipartisan Policy Center, and a range of child care advocacy groups. ""The lack of affordable quality child care is hurting Latino families and the American economy – with more than a $120 billion lost every year,” said Chair Nanette Barragán. “A recent study found that as child care costs have risen more than 200% in the last 30 years, more than 3 in every 20 Latino toddlers are living with a family member who quit their job or made a job choice based on their child care options. The Child Care Investment Act recognizes that Congress has not kept up with the child care realities of our nation and of the Latino communities that our caucus represents; and it implements commonsense changes to our tax code to ensure we help families who are struggling to stay afloat while balancing their jobs with the their family’s needs."" “Child care is not just a family issue. It is an economic issue,” said Congressman Carbajal.“I’m proud to earn the support of my colleagues in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus as we continue to see there is growing need for updating our tax code to ensure every Central Coast family can get access to quality, affordable child care. The momentum for this bill is growing, and I’m proud to see more members recognizing this bill as a commonsense way to revise our tax code and support our working families.” The bill is also backed by the First Five Years Fund, Early Care & Education Consortium, Learning Care Group, Save the Children, KinderCare, National Association of Women Business Owners, and the Santa Barbara South Coast Chamber of Commerce, Santa Maria Valley Chamber of Commerce, San Luis Obispo Chamber of Commerce, and Ventura Chamber of Commerce. The Child Care Investment Act improves three existing child care tax incentives to ensure the federal tax code adequately addresses the current realities of child care costs and availability. The bill expands a tax credit aimed at helping businesses provide child care to their workers by increasing the credit’s rate and caps, allowing businesses to jointly create and operate a child care facility for their employees, and adding in-home services as an eligible use. Currently, the Employer-Provided Child Care Credit only allows for a business to receive tax credits for contracting with an existing child care provider or creating their own facility. The bill doubles the amount of money that can be saved by a family in a tax-exempt Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account (DCAP) to cover child care expenses up to $10,000 annually, more accurately reflecting the average cost of child care in the U.S. The bill also allows an additional $2,000 in DCAP savings per each additional dependent. The current $5,000 annual cap has remained unchanged since the 1980s, when the dependent care savings account was first created.The bipartisan proposal also improves the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit, an existing tax write-off for Americans to offset child care expenses. The current rates would be increased for all eligible incomes, with a family with two children eligible to get up to $3,000 in credits for child care expenses. The bill would also make the credit fully refundable and index the bill’s increased tax credits to inflation. A more detailed summary of the bill proposed tax credit changes can be found HERE. The inspiration for this bill came from roundtables held by Rep. Carbajal in July 2022 discussing the impacts of inflation with small business owners in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo County, who conveyed that child care was one of their top concerns when it came to current business and hiring conditions.

119,April 17,Lori Trahan,D,Mass.-3,Trahan Secures Nation’s Top Health Official’s Commitment to Support Massachusetts Steward Crisis Response,"WASHINGTON, DC – Today, Congresswoman Lori Trahan (MA-03), a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s Health Subcommittee, secured a commitment from U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, the nation’s top health official, to work with Massachusetts leaders as they continue responding to the Steward Health Care crisis. CLICK HERE or the image below to watch Trahan’s full line of questioning.


 “Steward is facing a ‘significant cash crunch’ because of blatant mismanagement by company executives who have rewarded themselves with multi-million-dollar salaries while accruing massive debts. Unsurprisingly, Steward has failed repeatedly – including in response to requests from myself and my colleagues in the Massachusetts delegation – to provide transparency regarding its intentions to maintain the operation of their nine hospitals in our home state,” Congresswoman Trahan said. “Mr. Secretary, many of the hardworking families I represent just want to know that their government is paying attention to this issue and taking action to keep their hospitals open. I’m hoping I can count on you to maintain a line of communication with Massachusetts leaders to ensure that every possible action is taken and resource is available to keep community hospitals like Holy Family Hospital open and serving patients.” “Congresswoman, we will do everything we can,” Secretary Becerra responded. “We are ready to work with Massachusetts to make sure health care is available to communities.”  Last December, Steward announced plans to close Mt. Sinai hospital in Stoughton, the latest move by the company that also sold all of its facilities in Utah and closed Texas Vista Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas in 2023. A month later, the company it sold all of its Massachusetts properties to in 2016, Medical Properties Trust, announced that it would begin taking steps to claw back overdue rent payments from Steward, including the possible sale of some or all of its nine hospitals in the Commonwealth. In March, Steward announced that the corporation had reached a deal to sell its physician network to Optum pending regulatory approval. Last week, the Massachusetts delegation wrote to the DOJ and FTC requesting that they scrutinize the proposed sale of Steward’s physician group to Optum. In February, Trahan led the introduction of bipartisan legislation to direct additional federal funding to local, nonprofit safety net hospitals that would be directly impacted by the closure of or service cuts at Steward facilities in Massachusetts. During a January congressional hearing, Trahan slammed Steward’s private equity business model citing its track record of acquiring community hospitals, maximizing profits and cutting services, and then closing or selling what is left of the facility. --------------------------------- Congresswoman Lori Trahan Remarks as Delivered House Health Subcommittee Hearing on “Fiscal Year 2025 Department Of Health And Human Services Budget” April 17, 2024 Trahan: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It’s great to see you, Secretary Becerra. As you and I have discussed before, community hospitals around the country are facing significant financial challenges, and in my home state of Massachusetts, those challenges are being made worse by a private equity corporation that has prioritized profits over patients – and jeopardized the future of the nine hospitals it owns in the process. Mr. Secretary, as we speak, Steward Health Care – the largest for-profit, private equity backed health network in the country – is creating a health care crisis in working-class communities across Massachusetts, just as it did when it drove Texas Vista Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas into closure last year, when it was forced to sell off its hospitals in Utah just months earlier. Steward is facing a “significant cash crunch” because of blatant mismanagement by company executives who have rewarded themselves with multi-million-dollar salaries while accruing massive debts. Unsurprisingly, Steward has failed repeatedly – including in response to requests from myself and my colleagues in the Massachusetts delegation – to provide transparency regarding its intentions to maintain the operation of their nine hospitals in our home state. So instead, it announced the sale of its physician group to Optum, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, while providing no insight into the future of the hospitals their physicians practice in or what the proposed sale will mean for vulnerable patients. So Mr. Secretary, many of the hardworking families I represent just want to know that their government is paying attention to this issue and taking action to keep their hospitals open. I’m hoping I can count on you to maintain a line of communication with Massachusetts leaders to ensure that every possible action is taken and resource is available to keep community hospitals like Holy Family Hospital open and serving patients. Becerra: Congresswoman, we will do everything we can. This is actually a question more appropriate for me when I was Attorney General because we tried to take on some of these, I mean, they’re vicious investors that try to gut the assets out of an institution, and they just sort of run out of dodge. I can’t tell you that we have authority because we don’t govern the licensing of hospitals and so forth at the federal level. That’s all state. But we are ready to work with Massachusetts to make sure health care is available to communities. Trahan: I appreciate that, and I am encouraged by recent work your department has done in collaboration with the Department of Justice and the FTC regarding the effects of corporate ownership trends in health care, and my colleagues and I plan to submit comments as part of that process. This year, I’m spearheading efforts to commission a GAO study on hospital closures in the last decade to identify the ownership models that have closed and assess the impact of those closures on their communities. This type of study has been conducted for rural hospitals but not on a broader scale. If you could just speak a little bit to how improved transparency regarding hospital closures will help the agency to effectively address, respond to, and mitigate future community hospital closures, that would be great. Becerra: Yeah we’re actually doing something similar to that with nursing homes. We are tired of seeing nursing homes that get bought up – usually they’re owned by mom and pop people who start them up for, you know, wanting to help the community. Then they get bought up, and before you know it, you can’t trace back who the actual owner is. So, now we are requiring nursing homes to provide information on who the actual owners are, because they set up so many LLCs, so many different sham corporations, it’s tough to get to the bottom of it. Then when they run out of town after they gut the assets, people are left wondering what happened. So we would love to work with you on being able to have more transparency in the health care sector. Trahan: Thank you. I do believe that we can agree that as we address closures and acquisitions that don’t benefit patients, that it’s crucial to distinguish corporate, for-profit hospitals from their nonprofit peers. I introduced bipartisan legislation with Congressman David Valadao to establish a federal designation for Essential Hospitals. And I hope my colleagues on the committee will support this legislation. I hope to work with you Mr. Secretary to better support the essential health systems that all of our communities depend on for lifesaving care. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. ### ",Congress Progressive,"['washington dc today congresswoman lori trahan member house energy commerce committee health subcommittee secured commitment department health human service

120,April 17,Lori Trahan,D,Mass.-3,Trahan Pushes for Stronger Data Privacy and Transparency Provisions in Bipartisan Privacy Package,"WASHINGTON, DC – Today, Congresswoman Lori Trahan (MA-03), a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s Innovation, Data, and Commerce Subcommittee, highlighted necessary areas of improvement in the discussion draft of the American Privacy Rights Act (APRA), a bipartisan privacy package agreed to by House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA-05) and Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee Chair Maria Cantwell (D-WA). CLICK HERE or the image below to watch Trahan’s full line of questioning. 



 One of the bills discussed in today’s hearing was Trahan’s bipartisan, bicameral Data Elimination and Limiting Extensive Tracking and Exchange (DELETE) Act, which would establish a system through which individuals could request that all data brokers delete any personal data collected by the company and prohibit future collection. The current privacy discussion draft put forward by committee would allow Americans to request that data brokers stop future collection of their data but does not give them the right to have previously collected data deleted. “The DELETE Act, which I introduced with Congressman Chuck Edwards and Senators Bill Cassidy and Jon Ossoff, would give every American the right to have data brokers delete their data and prohibit future collection. This is a commonsense proposal that’s been discussed before in this committee because of the national security concerns with the way data brokers harvest and sell some of our most sensitive data to the highest bidder, including our foreign adversaries,” Congresswoman Trahan said. “Provisions of the DELETE Act were included in the privacy package that was advanced overwhelmingly out of this committee last Congress. However, I’m concerned that some of the changes to those provisions in the American Privacy Rights Act discussion draft will not fully meet the needs of American users.” Trahan also pushed for stronger transparency provisions in APRA, including mandating requirements for large technology companies to allow independent researchers to analyze the content moderation, algorithmic, and design actions on platforms to understand impacts on users and compliance with federal laws. Trahan has repeatedly pushed for increased researcher access, including by introducing the Digital Services Oversight and Safety Act that would create an Office of Independent Research Facilitation at the Federal Trade Commission to oversee a system through which independent researchers can study the impacts of covered platforms and their content moderation practices, product design decisions, and algorithms. “It’s essential to privacy and kids’ safety online that large data holders are transparent about their business practices and are held accountable by third parties. The best way to do that is to require that qualified researchers are able to study how the decisions made by powerful online platforms are complying with the privacy laws we hope to pass in this committee and impacting users,” Congresswoman Trahan continued. “I’ve been working with Senator Coons on language to empower researchers to take a look under the hood of powerful online companies like Meta and Google in a way that allows them to do their work while protecting user privacy and intellectual property.” During her line of questioning, Trahan applauded inclusion of her TLDR Act in the hearing and provisions of the bill in the bipartisan privacy framework. The TLDR Act, which she introduced with Senators Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and Ben Ray Lujan (D-NM), would require that online companies make their terms of service contracts more accessible, transparent, and understandable for consumers. A 2012 study found that it would take 76 work days for the average American to read the agreements for the websites and platforms they routinely use, and a 2022 poll found that nearly 9 out of every 10 Americans have agreed to a company’s terms of service without reading the contract first. ### ",Congress Progressive,"['washington dc today congresswoman lori trahan member house energy commerce

121,April 17,Lori Trahan,D,Mass.-3,"Trahan, Garcia Introduce Cambodian Genocide Remembrance Day Legislation","WASHINGTON, DC – Today, Congresswoman Lori Trahan (MA-03) and Congressman Robert Garcia (CA-42) introduced legislation to designate April 17, 2025 as Cabodian Genocide Remembrance Day to recognize the 50th anniversary of the fall of Phnom Penh to the Khmer Rouge, which went on to murder nearly 2 million Camodians. “Today, we mark the solemn anniversary of the start of the Cambdian genocide that saw nearly two million innocent citizens murdered at the hands of the Khmer Rouge regime. By dedicating this day as Cambodian Genocide Remembrance Day, we commit to never forgetting the atrocities committed, to cherishing the lives that were ended far too soon, and to continuing the hard work necessary to ensure it never happens again,” said Congresswoman Trahan, Chair of the Congressional Cambodia Caucus. “There is strong support in Congress for the Cambodian people, and we will continue to reaffirm America’s commitment to the upholding of human rights and democratic values in Cambodia.” “On the 49th anniversary of the Cambodian genocide, we honor the two million lives taken by the Khmer Rouge regime and the hundreds of thousands still in diaspora. This atrocity will never be forgotten. America will always stand in solidarity with the Cambodian people and will always be a safe haven for those who have suffered under violence and tyranny,” said Congressman Garcia. From 1975 to 1979, the Khmer Rouge and its leader Pol Pot engaged in a brutal, systematic genocide of innocent Cambodian citizens. By the time the Khmer Rouge was toppled, nearly 2 million Cambodians were killed, totaling almost 25 percent of the nation’s population. Thousands fled the killing fields for refugee camps in Thailand before being admitted to several nations, including the United States. Today, multiple communities are home to strong, vibrant Cambodia-American populations, including Lowell, Massachusetts and Long Beach, California. In 2019, Lowell, Long Beach, and Los Angeles passed resolutions proclaiming April 17th as Cambodian Genocide Remembrance Day. In 2023, the Massachusetts legislature passed legislation authored by State Representative Vanna Howard, the first Cambodian American woman elected to a state legislature in the nation, and supported by State Representative Rady Mom, the first Cambodian American elected to a state legislature, to do the same. “Today marks the 49th anniversary of the Cambodian genocide, when the Khmer Rouge took control of Cambodia and murdered close to 2 million Cambodians over the next four years, including many of my most precious family members,” said State Representative Howard. “The remembrance is certainly an important acknowledgement of all the survivors in our community. While we recommit ourselves to never forget the lives lost, we must also remain dedicated to ensuring that such an event never happens again, and that Cambodia will return to a free and fair democratic society, sooner than later. As a genocide survivor, I’m very proud the Massachusetts Legislature, for the first time in the history of Massachusetts, passed a House Resolution proclaiming April 17th as Cambodian Genocide Remembrance Day last year, and I’m pleased to see Congresswoman Trahan filing similar legislation at the federal level.” “As a survivor of the savage Khmer Rouge Genocide, who has the privilege of representing many other survivors in the Massachusetts House of Representatives, our history and our pain must never be forgotten. This resolution acknowledges the resiliency of the Cambodian people who survived this historic atrocity and pays respect to the all too many lives that were lost. I commend Congresswoman Lori Trahan for taking the lead on this important resolution,” said State Representative Mom. Last year, Trahan and Congressman Chris Smith (R-NJ-04), as well as Senator Edward J. Markey (D-MA), reintroduced the Cambodia Democracy and Human Rights Act, bipartisan and bicameral legislation to hold the Cambodian government accountable for abuses and corruption that undermine democracy and human rights. Lowell is home to the second largest Cambodian community and the largest Cambodian population per capita of any city or town in the nation. The strong Cambodian American community in the region has strengthened the local economy and contributed mightily to Lowell’s cultural resurgence. It has also been essential in the election of the first Cambodian American mayor, Sokhary Chau, and Cambodian American members of the Lowell City Council, Vesna Nuon and Paul Ratha Yem. “While many Cambodian Americans came to this country to escape political persecution and genocide, we have found much more than a safehaven against these evils. We have found a home and communities that have embraced us and celebrated our culture,” said Councilor Chau. “The Cambodian diaspora is grateful for the leadership of Congresswoman Lori Trahan and Congressman Robert Garcia for recognizing April 17th as Cambodian Genocide Remembrance Day.  By marking this day as Cambodian Genocide Remembrance Day, we honor the lives of those fallen and celebrate the accomplishments and the perseverance of those who have persevered. I'm proud to support this legislation to pay tribute to not only the survivors of the Cambodian Genocide, but also their children and grandchildren who are a testament to our people's resiliency and the promise of our future.” “Cambodian Genocide is a part of history that should never be forgotten, and marking the date will ensure that it is not. Even more important is acknowledging that Cambodia still bears the wounds of that era. While the government is no longer committing mass killings, it is silencing the voices that would cry out for democracy, and they are doing so through both incarceration and exile. Cambodia will not be free until the people have a say in how their country is run, until a government by the people is realized,” said Councilor Nuon. “It's been forty nine years since the fall of Cambodia on April 17, 1975 and the death of almost 2 million Cambodians including my entire family under the hands of Khmer Rouge Pol Pot. The pain is still raw and the hurt remains of being the only survivor of my entire family. One consolation is that I continue to tell the story of what happened in Cambodia during the four years of genocidal reign of the Khmer Rouge regime,” said Councilor Yem.

122,April 19,Lori Trahan,D,Mass.-3,"Trahan, Massachusetts Lawmakers Demand Answers on Proposed Sale of Steward Physician Group to Optum","WASHINGTON, DC – Today, Congresswoman Lori Trahan (MA-03), a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s Health Subcommittee, was joined by Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Edward J. Markey (D-MA) as well as Representatives Katherine Clark (MA-05), James P. McGovern (MA-02), Ayanna Pressley (MA-07), Stephen F. Lynch (MA-08), Jake Auchincloss (MA-04), Seth Moulton (MA-06), and William R. Keating (MA-09) in writing to the leaders of private equity-owned Steward Health Care and UnitedHealth Group requesting answers on the future of care in Massachusetts following the proposed sale of Steward’s physician group, Stewardship Health, to UnitedHealth-owned Optum Health. “Since Optum’s proposal to buy Stewardship, we have been contacted by both consumers and physicians with concerns about the potential impact on access to affordable, in-network care,” the lawmakers wrote. “In July 2023, UnitedHealth reported that Optum Health posted a 6.4 percent operating margin in the second quarter — the lowest since 2012.3 This has raised concern that the acquisition of more physicians may be an attempt to offset these lower margins, potentially compromising the autonomy of physicians who may be pressured to prioritize efficiency over personalized care.” Last December, Steward announced plans to close Mt. Sinai hospital in Stoughton, the latest move by the company that also sold all of its facilities in Utah and closed Texas Vista Medical Center in San Antonio in 2023. A month later, the company it sold all of its Massachusetts properties to in 2016, Medical Properties Trust, announced that it would be taking steps to claw back overdue rent payments from Steward, including the possible sale of some or all of its nine hospitals in the Commonwealth. In March, Steward announced that the corporation had reached a deal to sell its physician network to Optum pending regulatory approval. Just weeks before the proposed sale was announced, Optum’s parent company, UnitedHealth, became the subject of a federal antitrust investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC). UnitedHealth owns the largest health insurer in the United States while Optum employs the largest physician network in the nation, totaling 90,000 physicians and making up 10 percent of the physician workforce in the United States. “The absorption of doctor practices is part of a vast, accelerating consolidation of medical care, leaving patients in the hands of a shrinking number of giant companies or hospital groups,” the lawmakers continued. On Wednesday, Trahan secured a commitment from U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, the nation’s top health official, to work with Massachusetts leaders as they continue responding to the Steward Health Care crisis. Last week, the Massachusetts delegation wrote to the DOJ and FTC requesting that they scrutinize the proposed sale of Steward’s physician group to Optum. In February, Trahan led the introduction of bipartisan legislation to direct additional federal funding to local, nonprofit safety net hospitals that would be directly impacted by the closure of Steward facilities in Massachusetts. During a January congressional hearing, Trahan slammed Steward’s private equity business model citing its track record of acquiring community hospitals, maximizing profits and cutting services, and then closing or selling what is left of the facility. The lawmakers requested answers to the following questions by April 26th: a.    How many new physicians will Optum acquire in Massachusetts if the sale is completed? a.    Which specific debt-holders will be repaid, and in what order? b.    Will the acquisition result in any changes to the terms and conditions of the leases that MPT currently holds on the hospitals’ real estate? a.    Will Optum allow them to remain as members of these networks under the same terms and conditions?   b.    If so, for how long will Optum guarantee that these networks are retained? a.    Please provide a copy of the Letter of Intent signed between Steward and Optum for the sale of Stewardship Health.

123,April 17,Ralph Norman,R,S.C.-5,Rep. Ralph Norman Reintroduces the Earmark Elimination Act,"Washington, D.C. – On Wednesday, Rep. Ralph Norman (SC-05) reintroduced the Earmark Elimination Act. The Earmark Elimination Act would permanently ban federal earmarks. Background An earmark is an item in appropriations bills or large spending packages that designates money for a specific special interest group or project while avoiding the typical merit-based or competitive award process for federal funding. Prior to 2011, earmarks had become a frequent source of corruption and furthering of personal agendas by Members of Congress. In 2011, Congress passed a temporary ban on earmarks, which every session of Congress has since renewed. However, earmarks have returned and have been used by countless Members since Fiscal Year 2022. As first reported by Virginia Allen in the Daily Signal, Rep. Norman's bill would create a permanent federal ban on earmarks in the House of Representatives. This is the only way to limit the cost and impact of earmarks, as well as the corruption which comes with appropriating money to pet-projects simply to buy votes in Congress. With the U.S. $34 trillion in debt, Congress should not be putting taxpayers on the hook for frivolous handouts to politically connected friends. This bill is co-sponsored by Rep. Scott Perry (PA-10), Rep. Matt Rosendale (MT-02), Rep. Tom Tiffany (WI-07), Rep. Tom McClintock (CA-05), Rep. Andy Ogles (TN-05), Rep. Bob Good (VA-05), and Rep. Victoria Spartz (IN-05). This bill has the support of the National Taxpayer Union, Advancing American Freedom, and Heritage Action. Statements ""The use and abuse of earmarks by Members on both sides of the political aisle is appalling,"" said Rep. Norman in a statement on Wednesday. ""I will continue to reintroduce this bill to kill earmarks each Congress until others take it seriously. We owe that much to the taxpayers who we work for."" ""Taxpayers are fed up with earmarks and special interest spending. That is why the National Taxpayers Union is pleased to support Rep. Ralph Norman's Earmark Elimination Act, which would permanently ban earmarks. Getting deficits under control should be the top priority of Congress and cutting low-hanging fruit like earmarks should be the first step in a comprehensive process to balance the budget,"" said the National Taxpayers Union. ""Earmarks have always been wasteful. But today, they're increasingly wicked too: funding abortion facilities, antisemitic groups, and organizations that trans kids behind their parents' backs. Bringing earmarks back was a terrible idea. Congress must pass the Earmark Elimination Act immediately,"" said Paul Teller, Executive Director of Advancing American Freedom.   For questions about Rep.

124,April 16,Ann McLane Kuster,D,N.H.-2,Kuster Urges Action to Secure Patient Data Following Change Healthcare Cyberattack,"Washington, D.C. — Today, during a hearing in the prominent Energy and Commerce Committee's Health Subcommittee on “Examining Health Sector Cybersecurity,” Congresswoman Annie Kuster (NH-02) urged her colleagues to support the millions of Americans whose data was exposed and compromised by the Change Healthcare cyberattack in February 2024. “The Change Healthcare cyberattack not only disrupted timely care for patients in New Hampshire and beyond, it also exposed their private data to misuse by malicious actors,” said Kuster. “I’m deeply concerned about the amount of patient data that has reportedly been compromised—Congress must act to support consumers and patients impacted by this breach while we continue working to prevent these kinds of attacks in the future.” Cyberattacks targeting U.S. health care systems have affected millions of Americans. In January and February of 2023 alone, the data of 74 million Americans was leaked on the dark web. The attack on Change Healthcare impacted every hospital in New Hampshire, though it is unclear how many patients’ data may have been compromised.  As a co-chair of the Bipartisan Rural Broadband Caucus, Kuster is a fierce advocate for empowering rural communities with the resources they need to invest in their cybersecurity infrastructure and protect patient data.  ###",New Democrat Coalition,"['washington today hearing prominent energy commerce committee health subcommittee examining health sector cybersecurity congresswoman annie kuster urged colleague support million american whose data exposed compromised change healthcare cyberattack february', 'change healthcare cyberattack disrupted timely care patient new hampshire beyond also exposed private data misuse malicious actor said kuster', 'deeply concerned amount patient data reportedly must act support consumer patient impacted breach continue working prevent kind attack cyberattacks targeting health care system affected million american', 'january february alone data million american leaked dark web', 'attack change healthcare impacted every hospital new hampshire though unclear many patient data may compromised', 'bipartisan rural broadband caucus kuster fierce advocate empowering rural community resource need invest cybersecurity infrastructure protect patient data', '']",washington today hearing prominent energy commerce committee health subcommittee examining health sector cybersecurity congresswoman annie kuster urged colleague support million american whose data exposed compromised change healthcare cyberattack february change healthcare cyberattack disrupted timely care patient new hampshire beyond also exposed private data misuse malicious actor said kuster deeply concerned amount patient data reportedly must act support consumer patient impacted breach continue working prevent kind attack cyberattacks targeting health care system affected million american january february alone data million american leaked dark web attack change healthcare impacted every hospital new hampshire though unclear many patient data may compromised bipartisan rural broadband caucus kuster fierce advocate empowering rural community resource need invest cybersecurity infrastructure protect patient data
125,April 17,Ann McLane Kuster,D,N.H.-2,"Kuster, House Assistant Minority Leader Neguse: ""Seniors Over Special Interests, Families Over Corporations, People Over Politics""","Washington, D.C. — Today, House Assistant Minority Leader Joe Neguse was joined by leaders from every corner of the Democratic Caucus in a press conference calling out the draconian cuts proposed in the Republican Study Committee’s (RSC) backward budget. Supported by an overwhelming number of House Republicans and 100% of their leadership, the RSC’s 2025 budget would put a stop to critical programs American families rely on, gutting Social Security and Medicare. The Assistant Leader was joined by Representatives Brendan F. Boyle (PA-02), John Larson (CT-01), Pramila Jayapal (WA-07), Annie Kuster (NH-02), and Jan Schakowsky (IL-09).  Congressman Neguse and the participating members pointed to recent reports stating that Americans across the political spectrum are concerned by the RSC’s budget proposal with 55% of Republicans, 70% of Independents, and 92% of Democrats finding the suggested cuts concerning. Neguse’s opening remarks are as follows:  Assistant Leader Neguse: “Good morning. Thank you everyone for being here this morning. Week after week, House Republicans have continued to prove just how out of step they are with the priorities of the American people. Embroiled in constant chaos and conflict and dysfunction, our colleagues across the aisle are charting down a dangerous path – and I can think of no greater example of their disconnect than the Republican Study Committee’s backwards budget.  “Their plan upends critical programs, makes draconian cuts to Medicare and Social Security. It raises health care costs. It would strip coverage for millions, forcing Americans to work longer for less, and makes caring for our families more costly. The American people disagree with this plan. Overwhelmingly. A Navigator poll that was released today showing just how displeased they are with the Republicans attempts to slash these critical programs. “We are lucky to have in the House Democratic Caucus, a constellation of leaders who are on the front lines fighting against the Republican efforts to harm working families, including, of course, the Ranking Member on the Subcommittee for Social Security on Ways and Means and someone who's been a champion for Social Security throughout the duration of his career in the United States Congress, including, formerly as the chairman of our House Democratic Caucus, John Larson from Connecticut.” Social Security Ranking Member, Rep. Larson: “At a time when Congress has been looking at wealth disparity, it has to look no further than its own inaction. More than 50 years have passed since the United States Congress has enhanced Social Security. Every person here understands the necessity of what has to be done for the American people. 10,000 baby boomers a day become eligible for Social Security, and more than 40% of the 70 million Americans on Social Security – it's the only retirement benefit that they have. Democrats have a plan. We're going to make sure that there's an across-the-board increase. We're going to make sure that no one can retire into poverty.”  Ranking Member of the House Budget Committee, Rep. Boyle: “Every single Republican except for one on the House Budget Committee is a member of the Republican Study Committee. So, this is clearly the Republican budget. And what does it do? Right there, in black and white, it cuts Social Security for every American who is currently 59 years of age or younger by raising the retirement age. The retirement age is already going up. The full retirement age today is 66 and a half. It will soon be 67. How high do they want to go? 70? 72?”  “I would like to help my Republican friends get a little more attention for their crazy ideas. Because they're dangerous. These devastating cuts to Social Security and Medicare would impact almost every American family. Certainly, the families that I represent in North and Northeast Philadelphia and many places beyond. The good news is that House Democrats are here to fight them every step of the way. But let's be clear: If they're putting out their plan, we should believe them. This is what they plan to do if we don't fight back and stop them.”  Chair Jayapal: “What did Democrats do? Democrats? When we had the gavels, we worked hard to lower costs, health care costs for Americans across this country. We are the ones that made it possible to have a $35 a month insulin cap and a $2,000 a year out-of-pocket cap for seniors. Republicans are proposing stripping that progress.”  “All of this is also so that Republicans can keep giving big pharma and the wealthiest billionaires tax cuts. It's cruel, extreme, and unworkable. And Democrats are going to fight tooth and nail all the way, not only to prevent their extreme plan from being in place, but actually to implement our own plan, which continues to lower health care costs for seniors and for all Americans.” Chair Kuster: “This far right Republican House has made bipartisanship harder than ever before. And this misguided budget proposal is the latest example of the stark contrast between our values and the values that are represented by MAGA Republicans. From cuts to Medicare to raising the retirement age for Americans across the country and slashing Social Security benefits. This proposal would represent a massive step backward for the American people who are looking to Congress to move our country forward.” Co-Chair of the Task Force on Aging, Rep. Schakowsky: “What we are seeing is an attack on the most basic programs that define the United States of America, for example Social Security or Medicare. The Republican Study group, which makes up the majority of the Republican Party right now in the House of Representatives, has put in writing what they want to do, including raising the age of Social Security.”  “But when they talk about cutting Social Security, they are talking about taking money out of people’s pockets that they earned. Let's remember Social Security. Every single paycheck, people pay into it and expect to get it out. So, when they say that they want to raise the age, which is definitely a cut, they are saying they want to go into your pocket and taking money that is yours away [...] Democrats stand for the American people. We stand for making sure that all of these benefits are intact, and defeating the MAGA Republicans, who want nothing more than to make life miserable for most Americans.”  Key excerpts from the Q&A, include:  On GOP’s Motion to Vacate threats… Assistant Leader Neguse: “First and foremost, the chaos and the dysfunction that House Republicans have engulfed the U.S. Congress into for the better part of the last 15 months does nothing to help the American people and solve the consequential challenges that we face as a country. At the end of the day, any decision with respect to a Motion to Vacate or anything along those lines would be a decision that's made by our Leader, by Leader Jeffries, who has, I think, artfully and masterfully, time after time navigated, a number of these situations over the course of the last 15, 16 months.”  On MAGA Republicans endangering national security… Assistant Leader Neguse: “You're certainly right that the clock is ticking. It has been ticking. And Republican obstinance and delays have unfortunately, in my view, undermined our national security and the ability of our allies across the globe. House Republicans have faced a binary choice for the better part of the last two and a half months. And it is a choice that not just House Democrats have articulate it to them, but Senate Democrats, Mitch McConnell, the Republican Leader of the United States Senate, which is support our allies, support our national security by bringing forward, the bipartisan Senate bill, which passed, as you know, with 70 votes in the United States Senate on a bipartisan basis.”  Recording of the full press conference and Q&A can be found HERE.  ###

126,April 17,Ann McLane Kuster,D,N.H.-2,New Dem Leaders Hold Press Conference Urging House Republicans to Join Democrats in Saving the Affordable Connectivity Program,"Washington, D.C. — Today, New Democrat Coalition leaders, including NDC Chair Annie Kuster (NH-02) and New Dem Reps. Nikki Budzinksi (IL-13), Angie Craig (MN-02), Shontel Brown (OH-11), Gabe Vasquez (NM-02), and Emilia Sykes (OH-13) led a press conference calling on House Republican Leadership to join Democrats in funding the Affordable Connectivity Program, which will expire on April 30th without additional Congressional action. Ahead of the press conference, 95 New Dem Members – led by Reps. Craig and Budzinski – sent a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson calling on him to deliver for the American people and bring legislation to the floor that provides the ACP with the funding it needs without delay. You can read the full transcript of the press conference below and read the letter to Speaker Johnson here: Chair Annie Kuster:  Good afternoon everyone. I’m Annie Kuster, Chair of the New Democrat Coalition and I’m proud to stand here with my fellow New Dems in calling on Speaker Johnson and House Republicans to join us in saving the Affordable Connectivity Program.  Our Members were instrumental in securing this legislation as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in 2022. But now, if Congress doesn’t act, American households across the country could lose the ACP benefit and potentially lose internet access altogether. The ACP currently empowers 23 million American households across the country to access affordable broadband.  In my home state of New Hampshire alone, it has benefitted nearly 40 thousand households. These New Hampshire households are using this access to grow their small business operations online, access medical care through telehealth services, while some rural communities are getting this level of access for the first time.   Unfortunately, despite this being a bipartisan effort just two years ago, House Republican Leadership has blocked any consideration of funding for this program, pushing the ACP towards extinction. It’s no coincidence that Republicans don’t want to renew one of the most popular programs passed under a Democratic President during an election year.  But this isn’t a red-state or blue-state issue, this program benefits all Americans by ensuring everyone can participate in our modern, digital economy, regardless of where they live. A lapse in funding, which is expected at the end of April, will lead to a direct increase in broadband costs for consumers, internet disruptions, and lapses in coverage.  We all know how important the internet is to every generation. It enables children to complete their schoolwork, parents and adults to do their jobs, and grandparents and seniors to stay in touch with their family and friends. From ordering groceries to telehealth appointments and more, the internet is critical to participating fully in a 21st-century America.  That’s why our Coalition is here today, calling on Republicans to put aside their partisan politics and work with Democrats to secure this lifeline for American households once and for all. Now, I’m thrilled to turn it over to New Dem Angie Craig, who led the letter from New Dems with Nikki Budzinski.  Rep. Angie Craig: Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for being here today. We are here to urge Republican leaders to extend funding for the Affordable Connectivity Program – funding that is set to partially run out this month if nothing is done. The fact that we – here on Capitol Hill – are debating whether or not this program should exist is just another one of the unbelievable things here on Capitol Hill. Our entire world revolves around receiving and disseminating information, emails and messages quickly. No one at this press conference – or in this building – none of them could do their job without internet access. So how can we stand here – living in a world with unfettered access to the internet and all the benefits that come with it – and expect our rural communities to navigate the 21st century without internet access, when we never could? Today, I ask every Member to recognize the importance that high-speed internet access offers you, your family, your staff – and just try and picture your life without it, even for just one day. If you can’t live without internet, how could we ever ask rural Americans to? Cutting funding for the Affordable Connectivity Program will have devastating consequences. It would mean again that children are forced to sit in McDonalds’ parking lots just to do their homework, farmers unable to access online marketplaces for their products and rural Minnesotans left without access to telehealth resources. We cannot accept that reality for rural America – and I’m joining my New Dem colleagues and urging Republican leadership to step up to the plate and extend the funding for this critical program. Thank you so much, and now I’d like to turn it over to Representative Shontel Brown. Rep. Shontel Brown: Hello everyone, I’m Congresswoman Shontel Brown, representing Cleveland and Northeast Ohio. I’m proud to join my colleagues in urging Speaker Johnson to bring Congresswoman Clarke’s legislation to extend the ACP to the floor. Let’s be very clear. Killing the ACP is irresponsible… illogical… and inequitable. Killing the ACP is a conscious decision to deepen the digital divide. New Dems and members across our Caucus have been sounding the alarm on this for months – and Republican leadership is not budging. It saddens me that this is not a bigger story – because it shows how invisible lower-income people can be. In my district 46%... 46% of households have enrolled in the ACP. Nearly half. That’s one of the highest figures in the country. We’re talking about 135,000 households in my district. That should tell you about the level of need we have. And a very large percentage of these households are Black and Brown. And this mirrors what has taken place nationally… where over 5 million Black households have enrolled in the ACP. And these are people who literally just signed up. And now we’re pulling the plug and cutting the cord. The ACP is the difference between having high-speed internet or not, for lots of those households. That means access to telehealth, digital learning, job opportunities, entrepreneurship… and so much more. So often the other side of the aisle talks about self-empowerment and self-improvement. Well, this is one of the most necessary components to empowerment – and we need to extend it, not end it.  Finally, the digital divide is not new. It’s not something we just started talking about in 2020. The Department of Commerce identified racial and other disparities in internet access as a problem in 1995. And now here we are 30 years later …with the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the ACP… we made the most significant investment to date in closing the digital divide ever. We should not just throw away this progress. We cannot pull the plug on our constituents. It’s time for the Speaker to do the right thing and extend the ACP. And with that it is my privilege to turn it over the gentlewoman from Illinois, Nikki Budzinski. Rep. Nikki Budzinski: Good afternoon. My name is Nikki Budzinski. I represent the 13th District of Illinois – communities in Central and Southern Illinois. When I flipped this seat last year from red to blue, in 2022, voters tasked me with coming to Washington to bring down costs – the costs of everyday services to help working families at home. And that’s what the Affordable Connectivity Program is all about.  The ACP ensures that lower-income households can afford access to high-speed internet for work, school, health care and a lot more. In 2024, access to internet isn’t a luxury, it’s a necessity. Since the ACP was launched, more than 17 million households across the country have received support from this program. In the district I serve, I have more than 75,000 households that have subscribed to the Affordable Connectivity Program. And it’s saving families in my district nearly $40 million a year.  I held a roundtable in East St. Louis where nearly every household – exactly 95 percent of the residents in East St. Louis are reliant on the Affordable Connectivity Program in order to get internet access. In this one community in my district, I heard about what this program has meant for students, for families, for workers, for patients in East St. Louis during this roundtable. And this is quite frankly all at risk if the ACP expires at the end of this month.  My office has heard from more than 9,000 constituents who would be hurt by the disruption of this program. If Congress allows the ACP to lapse, internet services for millions of Americans will be disrupted. And that’s why I’m so proud to stand with the New Democrats and the colleagues behind me to urge the GOP leadership to maintain this critical program for families in my district and working families all across this country where it truly makes a very big difference. Thank you so much.”  Rep. Gabe Vasquez: Good afternoon, buenos tardes, my name is Gabe Vasquez. I proudly represent the second district of New Mexico, and I stand with my colleagues here today to advocate for common sense programs that help keep our low income and rural communities connected.  I understand how critical it is for my district in New Mexico to have affordable Internet access. Similar to my colleagues who represent these rural and low income districts, 40% of households in my district lack access to high speed internet. 180,000 families benefit from this program across the state. But these are more than just numbers. They're more than just statistics. This program represents the potential and the future of our families in New Mexico, whose lives are profoundly impacted by the continuation of this program. I've heard from constituents in the most rural parts of my district – in fact, they are conservative communities – where their livelihood depends on maintaining something like a website for their hunting and guiding businesses. I've listened to seniors in places like Deming and Truth or Consequences, who rely on internet services to stay connected with their families and have access to essential services, like tele-health and medication management. And I received messages for mothers, moms in my district.  We've shared how the ACP has allowed them to better manage their budget so that they can buy an extra $50 worth of groceries that month. This program makes a real tangible difference in the lives of everyday Americans from New Mexico to Ohio. But come April 30, without congressional action, we will be responsible for taking away one of the most vital resources that low income families across our nation have to access health care, education, information, and their own ability and independence to shape their own future.  We cannot in good conscience allow that to happen. That's why we must extend the Affordable Connectivity Program. Let our children be educated. Let their parents work. Let our seniors and our veterans access the health care that they deserve. Let small businesses thrive in rural America. That's what we're asking collectively here today. Let's keep America united and connected. Thank you. I'll now yield to my colleague from the great state of Ohio, Emilia Sykes. Rep. Emilia Sykes: Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you Congressman Vasquez, and thank you, Congresswoman Kuster and Congresswoman Budzinski for organizing today's press conference. My name is Amelia Sykes and I proudly represent Ohio's 13th congressional district in Northeast Ohio.  I'm glad to join my New Dem colleagues today to help call on House Republican leadership to take immediate action to extend the Affordable Connectivity Program, which 84,755 households in my district rely on for affordable internet services. In today's age, access to the internet is not a luxury – it is a necessity. In Northeast Ohio, and in my district, urban, rural and suburban communities alike rely on internet access to learn, work, seek medical care, and explore new opportunities.  The Affordable Connectivity Program has helped to close the digital divide in Ohio, and it provides critical resources to people in my district that depend on this for their livelihoods. In fact, this is the number one issue of concern for my constituents. I'll say that again. This is the number one issue of concern for constituents in my district.  My office has received thousands of emails from concerned constituents throughout my district from across the political spectrum, all worried about how they will afford connectivity if ACP runs out. Without this program, the cost of broadband for people in Ohio's 13th district and across the country will simply increase. My constituents and other Americans across the country cannot afford higher costs because of Republican inaction.  I promised the people in Ohio’s 13th district that I would fight to lower costs. And that's exactly what I intend to do by fighting to keep the Affordable Connectivity Program going. I hope my House Republican colleagues can put politics aside, join us in working for the people of our districts, and extend this vital program. ###",New Democrat Coalition,"['washington today new

127,April 18,Ann McLane Kuster,D,N.H.-2,"Kuster, New Democrat Coalition Leadership Express Support for Three Security Funding Bills that Support Our Allies and Deliver Critical Humanitarian Aid","Washington, D.C. — Today, New Democrat Coalition Leadership released the following statement in support of the national security supplemental funding bills introduced in the House that reflect the Senate-passed, bipartisan National Security Act, 2024: “For the last six months, New Dems have repeatedly urged House Republican leadership to bring forward legislation that supports our imperiled allies, Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan, and delivers much-needed humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza and around the world.  “Now, following months of House Republicans playing political football and ultimately blocking the Senate-passed national security package, the House will finally have the opportunity to vote on legislation that provides crucial aid to our allies in their battles against tyranny and terror.  “New Dem leadership supports this essential national security funding and urges our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join us in voting for its passage. “Now more than ever, for the sake of global democracy and freedom as well as our own national security, Congress must act swiftly and decisively to support our allies and protect innocent lives.  “America is always at its strongest when we stand with our friends – not when we turn our backs on them. We look forward to delivering this critical funding to President Biden’s desk without delay.” Read more about the Coalition’s repeated calls for a comprehensive security supplemental below: On April 14th, following Iran’s attack on Israel, New Dem leaders called on Speaker Johnson to once and for all bring a national security funding package to the floor by the end of the week. On March 22nd, after negotiators released the second six-bill appropriations package, New Dem leaders urged House Republican Leadership to live up to their commitments and bring a security and humanitarian aid package to the floor. On February 13th, following the Senate’s bipartisan passage of the National Security Act, 2024, New Dem leaders urged Speaker Johnson to “once and for all put the American people over petty politics and swiftly bring this bill to the full House for a vote.” On February 5th, New Dem Leadership and immigration and national security leaders released a statement in strong support of the Senate-negotiated border and national security package and admonished House Republicans for rejecting it out of hand. On December 19th, after Speaker Johnson dismissed lawmakers for the year without addressing critical priorities, New Dem Chair Kuster vowed that the Coalition would continue fighting to secure a deal that would send much-needed aid to U.S. allies. On November 15th, National Security Task Force Chair Marilyn Strickland (WA-10) led 44 New Dems in a letter to Armed Services Committee leadership promoting the Coalition’s priorities for the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Increased security cooperation with key allies like Ukraine and Israel was an integral part of these priorities. On November 15th, New Dem leaders penned a letter to congressional leadership with a total of 76 New Dem Members urging them to schedule a vote on President Biden’s supplemental request for security and humanitarian aid in support of Israel, Ukraine, Taiwan, and humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza. New Dem Leadership previously endorsed the $106 billion supplemental on October 20th. On November 2nd, NDC Leadership released a statement strongly opposing Speaker Johnson’s hyper-partisan supplemental appropriations bill that isolated Israel’s aid from support for Ukraine and Taiwan and omitted humanitarian aid for civilians in Gaza. They urged the Speaker to bring the President’s supplemental to the floor. ### ",New Democrat Coalition,"['washington today new democrat coalition leadership released following statement support

WASHINGTON – Today, Congressman David G. Valadao (CA-22) joined Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger (VA-07) and Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA) to introduce the Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act. The bipartisan, bicameral legislation aims to provide foundational digital skills to workers through a new “Digital Skills at Work” grant program.  “Ensuring people have the digital skills they need to navigate the modern job market is critical to the strength of our economy,” said Congressman Valadao. “When people enter the workforce with the foundational skills they need, it not only eases the burden on employers, but it sets people on a path to success for the rest of their careers. I’m proud to join Rep. Spanberger in introducing this bipartisan legislation that will help better prepare our workforce and strengthen our economy.” “When we help job seekers learn and refine on-the-job skills, we are helping Americans advance their careers and helping businesses hold on to adept and experienced employees. This bipartisan, bicameral legislation would empower states, localities, and local organizations — that are already doing incredible work to support our local workforces — to assist Virginians and Americans across the country in learning and building the industry-specific digital skills that will help them succeed in our 21st century economy,” said Congresswoman Spanberger. “Investments to close the digital skills gap help our workforce and our communities stay competitive and stay ahead, and I’m grateful for the support of Senator Kaine and Congressman Valadao as we work to deliver this support.” “Digital skills can be a gateway to new job opportunities for so many Virginians, especially at a time when I’m hearing from employers across the Commonwealth about how hard they’re working to hire up,” said Senator Kaine. “The Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act would make it easier for people to access high-quality digital training programs to develop or hone those skills. Investing in our workforce is good for our workers, employers, and overall economy, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join us in supporting this bill.” Background  According to the National Skills Coalition and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, 92 percent of today’s jobs require digital skills. Nearly one-third of workers do not have the foundational digital skills — such as email, spreadsheets, or data entry — to enter and succeed in today’s workforce. Americans who can qualify for jobs requiring at least one digital skill earn 23 percent more income on average annually.

WASHINGTON – Following Iran’s unprecedented attack on Israel over the weekend, the House of Representatives passed several pieces of legislation to hold Iran and its terrorist proxies accountable. Congressman David G. Valadao (CA-22) released the following statement: “The Biden administration’s strategy of appeasement toward Iran has failed,” said Congressman Valadao. “President Biden freed up $6 billion in Iranian assets last year, which only served to embolden the Iranian regime and their terrorist proxies who wish to do us harm. I voted in support of several bills this week to sanction Iran, designate their proxies as foreign terrorist organizations, and give Congress greater oversight of any administration that tries to weaken sanctions on Iran. We must send a clear message that there will be consequences for attacking American allies.” The Biden administration has taken several actions that have emboldened Iran, including waiving sanctions to allow $6 billion in Iranian funds to be transferred back to Qatar September of 2023.

130,April 16,Debbie Dingell,D,Mich.-6,Dingell Elected Democratic Policy and Communications Committee Chair,,Congress Progressive,Invalid input: Text should be a non-empty string.,Invalid input: Text should be a non-empty string.
131,April 16,Debbie Dingell,D,Mich.-6,"Dingell, Casey Introduce Bill to Revitalize Nation’s Long-Term Care Workforce","Today, Representative Debbie Dingell (MI-06), co-chair of the Assisting Caregivers Today (ACT) Caucus, along with Senators Bob Casey (D-PA), Chairman of the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging, Tim Kaine (D-VA), and Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), introduced legislation to tackle the caregiving crisis by reprioritizing long-term caregivers and supporting their work based on the value they bring to families. Millions of families with aging loved ones and people with disabilities require skilled care to live, but many caregivers today work long hours for low pay, resulting in some workers being forced the leave their field for higher paying jobs. This instability has resulted in widespread worker shortages for those in need of essential care.
 
The Long-Term Care Workforce Support Act would ensure that caregiving can be a sustainable, lifelong career by providing substantial new funding to support workers in every part of the long-term care industry, from nursing homes to home-care to assisted living facilities. By improving caregiver compensation, benefits, and support systems, the bill would ensure the nation has a strong, qualified pipeline of workers to provide much-needed care for older adults and people with disabilities.
 
“Caregiving is the foundation of our economy. It allows for all other work to be possible. No care worker should have to live below the poverty line to do this work that millions of Americans depend on. As many know, this is deeply personal for me – I was lucky to have my husband John receive care at home, but many others do not have the same opportunity,” said Congresswoman Dingell. “This legislation will make much needed investments in our care infrastructure and workforce, including family caregivers, to ensure they have the support they need, are paid a living wage, and are able to continue doing their critical jobs.”
 
“We have a crisis of caregiving in this country, and it’s a crisis that stems largely from a lack of support for and investment in our caregiving workforce,” said Senator Casey. “We cannot claim to be the greatest country in the world if we do not have the greatest caregiving in the world. We need to invest in these workers not just to ensure that caregiving can be a sustainable, lifelong career, but to improve the quality and availability of care for all who need it.”
 
“Every American, regardless of where they live, deserves access to quality, affordable care throughout their lives,” said Senator Kaine. “But too often, direct care workers in long-term care settings are overworked and underpaid, resulting in significant workforce shortages – especially in our rural communities. I’m proud to co-lead this legislation to help address the root causes of shortages in our care system, including by improving compensation and by providing pathways to enter the field. This will lead to healthier communities, and improved quality of life for older adults, people with disabilities, and their caregivers.”
 
“Having served as my grandmother’s primary caregiver as she aged, I know the hard work that goes into caregiving and the world of difference high-quality care makes for our loved ones,” said Senator Baldwin. “Right now, we're facing a desperate shortage in our long-term care workforce and sadly, it’s no surprise: many caregivers are forced to be on the clock for long hours, get low pay, and work in tough conditions. We owe it to caregivers who devote their lives to helping others to invest in the caregiving workforce, giving these compassionate workers the respect they deserve, attracting fresh talent, and ensuring our loved ones get high-quality care.”
 
Caregiving is in crisis across the United States. Caregivers are widely underpaid, earning a median wage of $15.43 an hour and often living in poverty. The result is caregivers are in short supply—a recent survey revealed 92% of nursing home respondents and nearly 70% of assisted living facilities reported significant or severe workforce shortages. Another recent survey of home and community-based services (HCBS) providers showed all 50 states experiencing home care worker shortages, and 43 states reported that some HCBS providers have closed due to worker shortages.
 
The Long Term Care Workforce Support Act will address this crisis by stabilizing, growing, and supporting the direct care professional workforce.

133,April 17,Scott Perry,R,Pa.-10,Congressman Scott Perry Introduces the No Propaganda Act,"Today, U.S. Representatives Scott Perry (PA-10), Thomas Massie (KY-04), Mary Miller (IL-15), and Andy Ogles (TN-05) introduced the No Propaganda Act to defund the biased Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB). The organization and its subsidiaries are staffed by extreme liberals, including the newly appointed divisive CEO of the National Public Radio (NPR) who has openly campaigned for Joe Biden.  “The American Taxpayer is footing the bill for a woke media corporation that pretends to be impartial while pushing Chinese propaganda,” said Rep. Perry. “CPB cannot be allowed to keep using your hard-earned tax dollars to push a biased and political agenda that goes against what’s best for Americans.” Claiming to be unbiased and serving in the best interest of the public, the CPB funds content that incorporates woke and divisive messaging. A whistleblower, and 25-year veteran of NPR, recently called out NPR for allowing its “pro-Democrat political leanings to seep into editorial judgments, including its decision to turn a blind eye to the Hunter Biden laptop story.” In addition to influencing public opinion about U.S. politics, CPB has worked with a Chinese Communist Party-controlled media outlet registered as a foreign agent to air a documentary promoting Chinese propaganda. These efforts are funded in part by CPB grants paid for by American Citizens.   “Congress must exercise oversight of the CPB and stop corruption in its tracks,” said Rep. Andy Ogles. “Taxpayers fund the CPB and it should be a source that provides a truly neutral and balanced perspective. That can only be achieved through the diversity of political ideology. Recent reports from a whistleblower indicate the CPB is nothing more than a propaganda machine for the Democrat party. I thank Congressman Perry for leading this bill to defund it and I’m proud to cosponsor.”",Freedom Party,"['today', 'representative scott perry thomas massie mary miller andy ogles introduced propaganda act defund biased corporation public broadcasting cpb', 'organization subsidiary staffed extreme liberal including newly appointed divisive ceo national public radio npr openly campaigned joe biden', 'american taxpayer footing bill woke medium corporation pretend impartial pushing chinese propaganda said perry', 'cpb allowed keep using tax dollar push biased political agenda go best claiming unbiased serving best interest public cpb fund content incorporates woke divisive messaging', 'whistleblower veteran npr recently called npr allowing political leaning seep editorial judgment including decision turn blind eye hunter biden laptop addition influencing public opinion politics cpb worked chinese communist medium outlet registered foreign agent air documentary promoting chinese propaganda', 'effort funded part cpb grant paid american citizen', 'congress must exercise oversight cpb stop corruption track said andy ogles', 'taxpayer fund cpb source provides truly neutral balanced perspective', 'achieved diversity political ideology', 'recent report whistleblower indicate cpb nothing propaganda machine democrat party', 'thank congressman perry leading bill defund proud cosponsor']",today representative scott perry thomas massie mary miller andy ogles introduced propaganda act defund biased corporation public broadcasting cpb organization subsidiary staffed extreme liberal including newly appointed divisive ceo national public radio npr openly campaigned joe biden american taxpayer footing bill woke medium corporation pretend impartial pushing chinese propaganda said perry cpb allowed keep using tax dollar push biased political agenda go best claiming unbiased serving best interest public cpb fund content incorporates woke divisive messaging whistleblower veteran npr recently called npr allowing political leaning seep editorial judgment including decision turn blind eye hunter biden laptop addition influencing public opinion politics cpb worked chinese communist medium outlet registered foreign agent air documentary promoting chinese propaganda effort funded part cpb grant paid american citizen congress must exercise oversight cpb stop corruption track said andy ogles taxpayer fund cpb source provides truly neutral balanced perspective achieved diversity political ideology recent report whistleblower indicate cpb nothing propaganda machine democrat party thank congressman perry leading bill defund proud cosponsor
134,April 16,Chellie Pingree,D,Me.-1,"VIDEO: In Interior Appropriations Hearing, Ranking Member Pingree Says Severe Maine Storms Highlight Important Need for Forest Service Disaster Funding","In a House Appropriations Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee budget hearing for the U.S. Forest Service today, Ranking Member Congresswoman Chellie Pingree (D-Maine) called attention to the severe storms Maine has endured in recent months, which have impacted local economies, infrastructure, and forests.  “Maine’s logging industry suffered more than $2.6 million in losses from the December storm alone, and has a domino effect on the Maine economy, with larger losses estimated at over $5.5 million. Many of these companies will be unable to file insurance claims because the losses aren’t covered,” Pingree noted in the hearing. Pingree asked U.S. Forest Service Chief Randy Moore how the Forest Service takes impacts of extreme weather events into consideration when managing partners’ forests and related industries.


 A complete transcript of the exchange is copied below. Click here to watch the full hearing. +++ Pingree: So, the state private and tribal forestry account provides vital financial and technical assistance to nonfederal landowners and resource managers in my home state. The Maine Forest Service has a long history of using these resources to provide services to small woodland owners, loggers, and foresters. But the state and private funding only goes so far. In the last few months, Maine has experienced four major storms that caused widespread water quality issues, washed out roads and bridges, and caused negative impacts to the health of the forests. Maine's logging industry suffered more than $2.6 million in losses for just one of those storms - the December storm alone - and has a domino effect on the Maine economy, with larger losses estimated at over $5.5 million. Many of the companies will be unable to file insurance claims because the losses aren't covered. I've seen some of the devastating pictures of road washouts. And, you know, you know, it's a short season when you can move trees and it's not you know, it's not mud, it's not snowed in. So, it's been a huge problem for them. So how is the Forest Service taking into consideration the impact of this extreme weather we're experiencing on the management of partners, forests and related industry and is providing more resources for this simply a matter of increasing the funding to state private and tribal forestry accounts or are there some other funding possibilities that a partner like the Maine Forest Service could explore?   We're just anxious to help them and we want to know what your thoughts are and any resources we should be looking at.  Chief Moore: So, Ranking Member, First, let me say that we can and we do request funding through the congressionally required disaster unfunded needs report that's provided. And so, we have received funding there. But to give you an idea of the requests versus the need is pretty significant. We have about $1 billion right now in backlog from request that's needed to respond to many of these disasters across country. And so, the request is one thing. Do we get enough to repair the damage? The answer is no, we don't, but it's helpful. And so, we want you to know how much we appreciate Congress response to our requests. You just said many of these things, more of them are happening, it seems. And whether you believe that is from climate differences, climate change or whatever it may be, it's happening more often. And so the requests are asked more often. And we understand the budget situation. We we fully understand that. But I do want you to know that there's a lot of damage out there. We did receive the 2023 funding requests for prior years, and it still wasn't enough.

In a budget hearing this morning with Department of the Interior (DOI) Secretary Deb Haaland, Pingree highlighted new funding from the Inflation Reduction Act for Acadia National Park, which will be used to implement the “Two-Eyed Seeing” model to meaningfully integrate Indigenous Knowledge with western science.  “The project will build on 15 years of consultation at Acadia National Park, Saint Croix Island International Historic Site, and Roosevelt Campobello International Park with the Wabanaki Tribes,” Pingree said during the hearing. “This is just one example of the amazing work the Inflation Reduction [Act] funding will support to prepare parks across the country to be resilient to climate change.” In February, the National Park Service announced $195 million for climate restoration and resilience projects over the next decade.  Secretary Haaland said the National Park Service’s budget includes $4 million for additional climate vulnerability studies and $2.5 million for climate related natural resource projects at the national parks.  “As you know, more than one third of coastal parks are at significant risk from sea level rise, coastal erosion and storm surge that's happening on all of our coasts,” Secretary Haaland said. “[…] Both of those investments could help the National Park Service make progress in addressing climate resiliency.” Pingree also called attention to the severe back-to-back storms Maine endured in recent months, refuting Rep. Ryan Zinke’s (R-Mont.) assertion that sea level rise is not due to climate change.  “You can say that there's some kind of tectonic plate shift going on or this isn't really real or whatever, but I invite you to come to my communities. These are fishermen. These are communities that are going to disappear, not to mention the tribal communities,” Pingree said. “[…] I thoroughly invite any anyone from this committee come spend some time in my district and see the coast of Maine. We’d love to have you. But you're going to you're going to see some tears in the eyes of fishermen and people.”


 +++   Clip 1:  Pingree:  Last week, Acadia National Park announced that the park will be receiving $950,000 in funding from the Inflation Reduction Act to create a model for addressing climate change vulnerabilities of coastal archeological sites, collections, landscapes and ethnographic resources. Something we we've we have a lot of in Maine, including in my own community. Acadia will be using the “Two-Eyed Seeing” model to meaningfully integrate indigenous knowledge with Western science. The project will build on 15 years of consultation at Acadia National Park, Saint Croix Island International Historic Site and Roosevelt Campobello International Park with the Wabanaki Tribes. This is just one example of the amazing work the Inflation Reduction [Act] funding will support to prepare parks across the country to be resilient to climate change. The National Park Service just announced projects to be funded by the full $195 million.  So could you just tell me I know a little bit about what's going on in my own state, but I'd like to know what other types of work are going on and how the funding will work to support the work across the park system.  Sec. Haaland: Yes. Thank you so much. We have been extremely proud of the work we've been able to do with tribes. I appreciate you mentioning indigenous knowledge. We believe very strongly that that is science that we all need to pay attention to, and it is really helping us to steward these lands through our tribal co stewardship agreements across the country. We've signed probably 200 of those, and there's probably 60 more that are that we're working on to ensure that we are that we're not missing anything because tribes have the experience more. And as you know, yes, more than one third of coastal parks are at significant risk from sea level rise, coastal erosion and storm surge that's happening on all of our coasts. The NPS budget includes $4 million for additional climate vulnerability studies and $2.5 million for climate related natural resource projects at the parks. Both of those investments could help the National Park Service make progress in addressing climate resiliency. We'll keep our eyes on that and continue to work as needed and certainly bring tribes into the fold when it comes to how we steward those lands.  +++ Clip 2: Zinke: Have you ever heard the term glacial isostatic adjustment? Sec. Haaland: I have not.  Zinke: Okay. So glacial isostatic adjustment on the East Coast is because we had glaciers, large, thick, heavy glaciers on the plate to the north in Maine, all the way down to Jersey. So when that plate moves and you have the glaciers on it and the glaciers are removed over time, there is an ice or static adjustment. So if you read that report, it would have talked about it and also would have talked about sea level rise versus depression. And I know you're probably not aware, but the sea level rise fully compensated for also the shift. The sinking is about one millimeter a year. […] Pingree: I guess I can't help myself. I want to mention something about sea level rise since you brought it up, our current Mr. Chair, and I really appreciate your willingness to focus on this, whether it's the tribes or other states. I guess I just have to say I'm happy to read the 2017 report. It is seven years and a lot has changed.  And I think, um maybe because you're in Montana, you don't see what I see in in the on the coast of Maine. So I'd be happy to invite you out any time or anyone on the committee who would like to take a look at this, who has some concerns about whether or not this is real. And I don't know about glacial isostatic adjustment, but I'm going to learn all about it. But I just want to tell you, this year we had two back-to-back severe storms. And I I'm sure in 2017, nobody in my community a fishing town 12 miles off the coast of Maine on an island, thought there would ever be anything like we saw this year. Two back-to-back storms. We have a 180-year-old ship boatyard, basically in our district, in our little town of 400. Everybody turned out between the first and the second storm because they were so worried that this building that's been there forever and the fishermen depend on was going to wash away. They had block and tackles and chains. They put cement blocks on the floor. They did everything they could possibly think of to try to hold it on land, to try to keep it there. And right now, we don't know if it'll survive. It got through that storm. It got through the second storm, but we're probably going to lose it. And you can come visit the coast to Maine and see up and down the coast of Maine, 150-year-old piers everywhere, communities like Stonington, Maine, fishing towns, they're washing away. This was a tide like we had never seen before in a storm surge from the southeast, which is weather we used to never have before. So you can say that there's some kind of tectonic plate shift going on or this isn't really real or whatever, but I invite you to come to my communities. These are fishermen. These are communities that are going to disappear, not to mention the tribal communities. I'm just talking about our fishing towns, our community piers. They're going away. This tide this tide is higher than we have ever imagined could happen to us. And it's not even there yet. It's not even anywhere near what the maps say. Places that are peninsulas are going to turn into islands. Communities are losing their sewer systems, their infrastructure. It's all going away.  So it's one thing to sit inland in Montana. You get mountains, you can run to the top, but we don't have those options. And however we want to describe why this is happening, I just want to thank you, Madam Secretary, in your department for putting this focus on because this is extremely real to us. It's very emotional to us. It's the end of so many of our communities and we don't know where we're going to get the money to deal with all this. We don't know how we're going to move to higher ground when there isn't higher ground or it's already filled up. Our island communities, our coastal communities. This is really serious to us. So thank you for your attention to us.  I thoroughly invite any anyone from this committee come spend some time in my district and see the coast of Maine. We’d love to have you. But you're going to you're going to see some tears in the eyes of fishermen and people. Hard core Republican conservatives who don't always vote for me, but they want to know what we're going to do about this. And I invite you to join us in doing that.  Sec. Haaland: Ranking Member If I could just say very quickly, Maine was one of the first places I visited when I came into this position … at Acadia National Park and so I, I just want you to know that we care deeply about every single community that is facing these issues. It's, you know, it's American traditions, the fishermen. And we equate that with when we think about those fishermen, we think about your state. So it's it is heartbreaking when you think that these are lives of people that are getting washed away. And so we're doing everything we possibly can to address the issues.  Pingree: I thank you for that and I thank you for visiting our state. The challenge is and I think this is what many of us saw this winter that we'd never really had really had knowledge in this visceral way. This is so much bigger than any one of us. This is so much bigger than the budget that we have. This is so much bigger than our petty arguments about what's real and not real. You just got to come and see it to understand. And if it can happen twice this winter, you know what's coming next year.

136,April 17,Debbie Wasserman Schultz,D,Fla.-25,Wasserman Schultz Commends Biden’s Move to Snap Back Sanctions on Maduro Dictatorship,"Washington DC – U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (FL-25) issued the following statement in response to the Biden Administration’s move to reinstate U.S. sanctions on the Maduro regime in Venezuela: ""Venezuelans deserve real democracy, and I’m proud that President Biden took strong action today to help deliver it. I commend President Biden's decision to fully enforce the terms of the Barbados Agreement by snapping back sanctions on the Maduro dictatorship's illicit oil profits. I know the people I represent appreciate the Administration's commitment to amplify the voices of Venezuelan Americans who demand democracy. ""The need for action was clear: The regime refused to register opposition candidate María Corina Machado or her substitute, Dr. Corina Yoris, and Maduro has demonstrated his cruel neglect for his obligation to provide for a free and fair election by continuing to terrorize, harass or imprison human rights defenders, charitable organizations, and journalists.  ""These unacceptable breaches of the Barbados Agreement, a good-faith effort by the President and Venezuela's democratic opposition, which was agreed to by Maduro and designed to make progress towards a return to democracy, have been met with a swift and forceful response.  ""As co-chair of the Congressional Venezuela Democracy Caucus, I am proud that President Biden is taking deliberate action to promote democracy and hold Maduro's brutal regime accountable.

137,April 19,Nanette Barragán,D,Calif.-44,In the Spotlight: Nanette Barragan,"CQ Roll Call April 15, 2024  California Democrat Nanette Barragán, chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and other Congressional Tri-Caucus leaders are calling for the restoration of the House Office of Diversity and Inclusion after its funding was slashed.  Republican appropriators zeroed out $3.5 million for the diversity office in the fiscal 2024 package enacted in March (PL 118-47). Barragán joined Congressional Black Caucus Chair Steven Horsford, D-Nev., and Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus Chair Judy Chu, D-Calif., in an April 8 letter to Democratic leaders calling for restoration of funding in the future.  “Republican lawmakers are so eager to score political points by eliminating all diversity and inclusion programs that they undercut a non-partisan office that dozens of their own Members have used to identify highly qualified candidates that they went on to hire,” the group wrote. House Republicans have been critical of the office, claiming it had become partisan. Getting to Congress: Barragán took her first steps into politics with a role in the White House’s Office of Public Liaison under the Clinton administration. She worked as a lawyer before winning a seat on the Hermosa Beach City Council. Barragán served on the city council for two years, including a short stint as mayor, before throwing her hat in the race to replace Democratic Rep. Janice Hahn, who left Congress in 2016. Barragán pulled off an upset victory against Democratic State Sen. Isadore Hall, the California Democratic Party’s preferred candidate.  Her District: The 44th District is an urban district encompassing parts of Los Angeles and Long Beach in Southern California. A major economic driver is the Port of Los Angeles. The port has ranked as the busiest container shipping port in the Western hemisphere since 2000 and is a key connection for trade with Asia, according to statistics released by port officials. Nearly $300 billion worth of cargo passed through the port in 2023. The predominantly Hispanic district is a Democratic stronghold, and Barragán won her last election with over 72 percent of the vote. What’s New: Barragán criticized Democrats in February for excluding members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus from negotiations over border provisions included in an initial version of a foreign aid package (HR 815). “Imagine a civil rights or criminal justice bill negotiated without the Congressional Black Caucus at the table,” Barragán said in a Feb. 5 statement. That proposal stalled in the Senate after a majority of Republicans swiftly came out against the border agreement, despite having insisted for months that they would only support additional aid for Ukraine if it was accompanied with tighter border security provisions. The following week, the Senate passed a $95.3 billion security supplemental without the border deal. Point of Interest: Since coming to Washington, Barragán has been a regular participant in the Congressional Women’s Softball Game, an annual charity match between lawmakers and members of the press. Barragán, who also plays in other congressional sporting events, made her high school baseball team, but ultimately joined the softball team instead after receiving flak from boys. “And the guys weren’t very good,” she said.

138,April 19,Morgan Griffith,R,Va.-9,Congressman Griffiths Weekly E-Newsletter 4.19.24,"Last weekend, I hosted my annual Service Academy Day at the New River Community College in Dublin.   I enjoy these events as they provide great opportunities for high school students, parents and educators to learn about Service Academies, Army Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC), and other programs.   I take pride in allowing students in Southwest Virginia to have access to opportunities to admirably pursue a career in military service.   The Ninth District is home to many patriotic men and women, and we also have a rich tradition of service.   A major piece of our history involves the D-Day invasion of Normandy during World War II. When Company A stormed Omaha Beach on June 6, 1944, there were 35 soldiers from Bedford. By the end of the campaign, 23 would be dead, making Bedford, Virginia, the town with the highest per capita deaths.   Bedford commemorates this sacrifice by true Virginia heroes with its National D-Day Memorial.    Bedford is Virginia’s only WWII Heritage City.   I am honored that it is in the Ninth District.   Given our rich heritage, I host Service Academy Days to tap into the patriotic spirit of our youth. Families and children travel from across the Ninth District to attend and get more information. Some even attend from other states.   Invited guests typically include representatives from the U.S. Military Academy, U.S. Naval Academy, U.S. Air Force Academy, U.S. Coast Guard Academy, U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, Virginia Military Institute, Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets, Virginia Tech ROTC, and Emory & Henry ROTC.   The representatives from these programs consist of current and former cadets, admissions officers and ROTC directors and students who actively engage with interested individuals and discuss their options for a college military experience.   As a Congressman, I am permitted to fill five vacancies over a four-year period at each Academy, with the exception of U.S. Merchant Marine.   While U.S. Merchant Marine is not a popular selection for many in Southwest Virginia, I can fill ten vacancies each year there.   Once the U.S. Merchant Marine program is completed, the participant becomes eligible for commission into any branch of the U.S. military, provided that they are in good standing.    ROTC programs are another option. They are great at providing leadership and physical training exercises for students while they continue their academic studies at their university or college.   Some historians trace the roots of ROTC programs to the Morrill Act of 1862, also known as the Land Grant Act of 1862. This was signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln.   At the time, there was a stark decline in the numbers of trained engineers present in American colleges and universities.    The Land Grant Act laid the groundwork for a national system of state universities. The bill granted 30,000 acres of public land to each state for the establishment of institutions of scientific learning. The land grant institutions reciprocated by offering military tactics courses.    Virginia Tech maintains a strong record in this space. Their campus features a War Memorial Court, dedicated to the eight VT alumni who are medal of honor recipients. Close to the War Memorial Chapel is a marble cenotaph with their names etched into it.   VT sponsors a ROTC program, as well as VT Corps of Cadets.   The mission of the VT Corps of Cadets program is to nurture and create great leaders. The four-year program draws upon exercises that target teamwork, character and problem-solving skills. This is designed to develop leadership qualities among our brave servicemen and women and shape future leaders within our military.   The VT Corps of Cadets prides itself in giving back to the community. In the 2022-2023 academic school year, cadets collected over 2,000 hours of community service.     I was proud to hear that my alma mater, Emory & Henry College, relaunched their own Army ROTC program in 2018 after nearly a century.    As of 2018, Emory & Henry became one of only five private institutions in Virginia to offer an ROTC program.     Another Virginia private institution that comes to my event is VMI.   VMI has an extensive recruitment network. VMI excels in showcasing their opportunities and highlighting their illustrious history of producing exceptional military talents, the likes of whom include former U.S. Secretary of Defense, George C. Marshall, Jr.   If you or someone you know is interested in applying to attend one of our academies, please contact Josh Hess at josh.hess@mail.house.gov or (540) 381-5671.   If you have questions, concerns, or comments, feel free to contact my office.  You can call my Abingdon office at 276-525-1405 or my Christiansburg office at 540-381-5671.  To reach my office via email, please visit my website at https://morgangriffith.house.gov.  Also on my website is the latest material from my office, including information on votes recently taken on the floor of the House of Representatives.   ### Enter your email address to get the latest updates straight to your inbox.

139,April 18,Julia Brownley,D,Calif.-26,"Brownley, Ezell, Whitehouse, and Wicker Lead Bipartisan, Bicameral Resolution Recognizing the United States Navy Seabees","Washington, DC – Today, Congresswoman Julia Brownley (D-CA) joined Congressman Mike Ezell (R-MS) in introducing a resolution marking the 82nd anniversary of the establishment of the United States Naval Construction Force, more commonly known as the “Seabees.” The resolution recognizes the tremendous sacrifices and contributions of the Seabees, who have fought and served on behalf of our country. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Senator Roger Wicker (R-MS) introduced the companion legislation in the United States Senate.   “On the 82nd anniversary of the founding of the Navy Seabees, we acknowledge the thousands of service members – past and present – who have bravely defended our shores in every conflict since World War II. With a ‘Can Do’ motto, the Seabees carry out a mission to build bases, roadways, airstrips, and other essential infrastructure necessary for our military at home and around the world,” said Congresswoman Brownley. “As the proud representative of Naval Base Ventura County and home of the Pacific Seabees, I am honored to recognize and pay tribute to these remarkable sailors and their distinguished service to our country.” “For more than eight decades, the Seabees have served with honor, ingenuity, and a “Can Do” attitude,” said Congressman Ezell. “I am proud to have the Atlantic fleet Seabees call South Mississippi home, and I am incredibly grateful for their contributions to our nation and to our coastal communities.” “The remarkable history of the Seabees began right here in Rhode Island,” said Senator Whitehouse. “This resolution highlights the many contributions of the industrious Seabees in service to our country, and recognizes the role the Ocean State has played along the way.” “The Seabees are an integral part of Mississippi’s military history and Gulfport’s community. They have often put themselves into dire situations, whether assisting with natural disaster recovery or humanitarian missions across the globe. Our country and world are better off because of them,” said Senator Wicker. The resolution is also cosponsored by Representatives Seth Magaziner (D-RI), Gabe Amo (D-RI), Michael Guest (R-MS), Trent Kelly (R-MS), Nick Lalota (R-NY), Carlos A. Giménez (R-FL), Jill Tokuda (D-HI), Salud Carbajal (D-CA), Barbara Lee (D-CA), Mark Takano (D-CA), John Rutherford (R-FL), Adam Schiff (D-CA), and Bennie Thompson (D-MS), as well as Senators Jack Reed (D-RI) and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS).

140,April 18,David Scott,D,Ga.-13,Congressman David Scott Presses Governor Kemp to Take Immediate Action on Ghost Guns,"WASHINGTON- Today, Congressman David Scott (GA-13), Ranking Member of the House Agriculture Committee, sent a letter urging Governor Brian Kemp to take executive action to curb the production and possession of un-serialized and untraceable weapons commonly known as “ghost guns.” “Our communities are facing a scourge of violence because of homemade weapons that can be purchased and manufactured using the internet,” said Congressman David Scott. “Georgia’s lack of state statutes against these guns has caused them to permeate the streets, wreaking havoc in our communities. That is why I am calling on Governor Kemp to uphold his responsibility as our state’s chief law enforcement officer and use his authority to regulate ‘ghost guns’ and save lives.”  Ghost guns are often purchased online through pre-made gun kits complete with instructions. Once assembled, these firearms do not contain serial numbers, making them untraceable and especially dangerous in the hands of criminal actors. Also of concern is 3-D printed gun parts which can increase the fire rate and lethality of previously unmodified weapons. The accessibility and untraceable nature of ghost guns is highly concerning, as they remove barriers for individuals who would otherwise be denied access to firearms. The letter has been endorsed by BlackPush, an Atlanta-based advocacy group dedicated to preventing gun violence and ending social injustice. ""With the rocketing rates of gun violence facing our nation, we must do more to limit access to guns by those seeking to do harm,” said BlackPush President and Founder Shaun Smith. “In Georgia, recent tragedies have underscored the negative impact that guns can have on our society and our communities while shattering the lives of those impacted. We echo Congressman Scott’s call to regulate ‘ghost guns’ and we further call on the State of Georgia to look at passing red flag laws, expanding background checks, and investing in mental health treatment.""

141,April 18,Ayanna Pressley,D,Mass.-7,"Pressley, Haiti Caucus Co-Chairs Urge Reauthorization of Haiti Trade Preference Programs","April 18, 2024 Letter to Ways and Means Committee Emphasizes Support for HOPE/HELP Text of Letter (PDF) WASHINGTON – Haiti Caucus Co-Chairs Congresswomen Ayanna Pressley (MA-07), Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick (D-FL), and Yvette D. Clarke (D-NY) led a letter to House Ways and Means Committee leadership emphasizing support for the early renewal of the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement (HOPE) and the Haiti Economic Lift Program (HELP) Acts, commonly known as HOPE/HELP. The HOPE/HELP program allows duty-free access for certain apparel and textile products from Haiti to the U.S. market. “Now more than ever is the time to help stabilize Haiti and save lives – that includes supporting its economic growth and critical trade sectors,” said Congresswoman Pressley. “The Haitian people have suffered deeply and to allow HOPE/HELP to expire would be a drastic disservice to their livelihood. I am proud to join my fellow co-chairs in calling for the reauthorization of these vital programs and preserving our longstanding trade partnership with our Haitian neighbors.” “HOPE/HELP plays a critical role in driving economic expansion in Haiti’s garment industry and fostering employment in the country,” said Congresswoman Cherfilus-McCormick. “In these uncertain times for Haiti, it is imperative that we uphold and continue this vital program to ensure Haiti’s continued economic progress and stability.” “With the ongoing security crisis confronting Haiti, it is critical Haiti’s economy has the support needed to endure this challenging period in its history. Make no mistake – the swift renewal of HOPE/HELP is essential for Haiti’s post-crisis recovery and the future of its communities,” said Congresswoman Clarke. “Allowing Haiti’s apparel industry to lose necessary support in this moment of uncertainty would only serve to pull the rug out from under Haiti’s economy and instill further hardship on a nation that has already suffered dearly. Haiti and its people remain cherished allies of the United States, and that is why I am proud to stand with my fellow Co-Chairs of the Haiti Caucus to call for the continued funding of these vital programs.” HOPE/HELP is due to expire in September 2025, a little over a year from now.  As a result of these programs, apparel exports have grown to over $1 billion, representing over 80% of Haiti’s total exports. While the security crisis has justifiably received the most attention, the House Haiti Caucus recognizes the essential importance of maintaining Haiti’s formal economy.  Immediate reauthorization of HOPE/HELP ranks as one of the top policy priorities that the United States can do to help Haiti at this moment in time.  Additional signatories of the letter include Reps. Alma Adams (D-NC), Mario Diaz-Balart (R-FL), Gerald Connolly (D-VA), Adriano Espaillat (D-NY), Maxwell Alejandro Frost (D-FL), Dan Goldman (D-NY), Jonathan Jackson (D-IL), Sydney Kamlager-Dove (D-CA), Barbara Lee (D-CA), Michael Lawler (R-NY), Andre Carson (D-IN). A copy of the letter text can be found here. As Representative for the Massachusetts 7th Congressional District, Congresswoman Pressley serves as Co-Chair for the House Haiti Caucus and represents one of the largest Haitian diaspora communities in the country, with approximately 46,000 Haitians and Haitian-Americans living across the state and over half in the Boston metropolitan area. Additionally, Massachusetts is home to more than 4,700 Haitians with Temporary Protected Status. ### Washington DC Office 402 Cannon HOB

142,April 18,Pramila Jayapal,D,Wash.-7,Jayapal Statement on H.Res.1143 Vote,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Representative Pramila Jayapal (WA-07) released the following statement on her “no” vote on H.Res 1143: “Iran’s attack on Israel was a dangerous escalation in what could quickly turn into a larger regional war. I condemned the attack by Iran, as well as the precipitating hostilities that led to the attack, and I called for immediate de-escalation to reduce the threat of these actions widening into a larger regional conflict. I also supported President Biden’s actions, along with allies, in thwarting the Iranian attack and defending Israel against those threats.  “I voted no on this resolution because I am concerned that it further escalates the situation at exactly the time that we need to do the opposite. It does not mention the precipitating strike on the Iranian embassy by Israel that led to this attack. It ‘fully supports’ further offensive action by Israel and calls for continued arms sales to Israel. It makes no distinction between aid to Israel for defensive purposes—such as the Iron Dome funding or against threats from Hezbollah and Iran—versus aid to Israel for offensive strikes against innocent civilians in Gaza. While I continue to support defensive aid to Israel, I have been clear that I cannot support offensive military aid to Israel with no strings attached while the Netanyahu government continues to kill innocent civilians in Gaza — both through military action and the blocking of humanitarian aid leading to famine. “This is a time to de-escalate the conflict, not promote retaliatory violence, and I appreciate President Biden’s leadership on this issue. It is also of the utmost importance to achieve an immediate ceasefire to end the killing of innocents, return the hostages, and create a path for peace and security in the region. That is where our focus must be in this moment.”

143,April 16,Hank Johnson,D,Ga.-4,"Congressman Talks Arbitration, Consumer Rights in Keynote Speech","Keynote Speech at National Consumer Law Center Spring Training Event Delivered Remotely
Friday, April 12 at 4 PM at Omni Hotel at Centennial Park  Hello everyone, thank you for having me here this afternoon.  It is my honor to have been invited to deliver the keynote address to this, the Spring Training Event of the National Association of Consumer Advocates, a group that I deeply respect and whose work I greatly admire.  I want to thank you for your tireless efforts protecting the rights and interests of everyday people, workers, and consumers. For decades the pendulum has been stuck on the side of the powerful, the wealthy, and the greedy. So the rich have gotten richer, the middle class has shrunk, the poor are getting poorer, and the courthouse doors have gotten heavier and heavier to open for those seeking to hold the corporate and business interests accountable for the harms they do to the so called ""little guys"" of our nation.  
 
And I want to thank particularly your Georgia members, who represent consumers when they get mistreated, cheated and/or ripped off by bad actors in the commercial sector. When your members are seeking relief for the consumers they represent, they are more and more met with the barrier posed by forced arbitration clauses imbedded in take it or leave it contracts, or terms of service agreements. 
 
Using consumer protection statutes as the shield to protect your clients, your members empower consumers to stand up for their legal rights despite the deck being stacked against them.  
 
Legislatively nullifying and banning pre-dispute forced arbitration clauses in consumer and employment agreements has been a cause that I took on shortly after being sworn in as a member of Congress, almost 18 years ago. I cant believe that it’s been 18 years! It’s been a long slog to make change, but we have seen the Forced Arbitration Injustice Repeal Act pass out of the House and on to the Senate the past two sessions of Congress. There is still much work to be done to get the FAIR Act passed in the House AND Senate, then signed into law by the President. The task is daunting, but we are making progress and as long as I am a member of Congress I will never give up on passing the FAIR Act into law.  I hung a shingle and practiced law for 27 years before being elected to Congress. During those 27 years, I also served for 12 years as a Magistrate Court Judge presiding over small claims court cases, among other responsibilities. During all those years, handling so many cases -- only once did I encounter the barrier of forced arbitration. It was about three months before I shut the doors to my law practice at the end of 2006. A friend brought in a case against her seeking the confirmation of an arbitration award in a debt collection case. One of my last acts as an attorney was to work out a payment plan after having determined that my client was bound to the arbitration award due to the consumer agreement that she had signed.  The next time I encountered forced arbitration was a year or two later, when my wife and I were thinking about downsizing and we were looking at building a townhome. In reviewing the documents, I came across a clause that required us to waive our rights to file a lawsuit in court in the event of the builder’s default under the terms of the contract. The contract mandated that any dispute with the builder/developer would have to be adjudicated via arbitration. I don't remember the fine details in the contract about the selection of the arbitrator, the venue of the proceeding, who pays the costs, etc., but I do recall walking away from the deal with a bad feeling about the developer and how unfair the deal was, after they refused to cross out the arbitration clause in the agreement.  Since then, I have witnessed the explosion in the use of forced arbitration clauses in just about every transaction in which a little guy engages, in the process of living a regular life during these rapidly changing times in which we live. 
 
Forced arbitration is a trick used by the powerful to prevent the less powerful from suing them in court in front of a jury of their peers. From terms-of-use agreements with cell phone service providers and social media companies to opening a bank account,  purchasing or leasing a car, to agreements needing to be signed to place our loved ones in a nursing home -- one can expect to be forced to sign or acknowledge that they are waiving their right to go to court in the event of a dispute, and agree to be bound by the arbitration process. Its a take-it-or-leave-it situation, and the consumer is forced to waive their rights if they want a cell phone, because you cant find a provider that offers service that doesn't require forced arbitration.  So how did we get to this point where if you want a job, or to purchase just about every good or service in America, you are required to sign away your 7th Amendment right to a trial by jury in a court of law? The floodgates for forced arbitration were opened wide by our very own Federalist Society stacked federal and state judiciaries, led by an activist Supreme Court of the United States. That's why I have filed legislation that unpacks the Supreme Court by adding four justices, legislation that would impose 18-year term limits on Supreme Court justices, legislation adding 77 new federal district court judgeships, and in the last Congress and in the next session of Congress, I will introduce legislation to increase the number of judgeships on the nation’s federal courts of appeals. In the 1995 case of Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v Dobson (513 U.S. 283), Justice (Sandra Day) O’Connor wrote: “over the past decade the Supreme Court has abandoned all pretense of ascertaining congressional intent with respect to the Federal Arbitration Act, building instead, case by case, and edifice of its own creation.” Justice O’Connor was spot on with her analysis. Starting in the 1980’s, the Supreme Court began transforming the Federal Arbitration Act into something never intended by Congress, which passed the Act in 1925 to provide an alternative by which businesses of equal standing and power could resolve disputes without protracted litigation in court.  Under current Supreme Court law, arbitration can be forced upon the much less powerful consumer by the wealthy and powerful corporation, by way of a take-it-or-leave it contract. And I don't have to tell you all of the disadvantage the consumer faces when forced into arbitration when a dispute arises. Nor must I convince you that the threat of a jury trial levels the playing field for the consumer against the wealthy and powerful business against whom the dispute arose.  Passage of the FAIR Act would render unenforceable forced arbitration clauses in in consumer agreements. The legislation currently has 100 cosponsors, and when Democrats controlled the House we passed the FAIR Act 225 to 186 in the 116th Congress, and 222 to 209 in the 117th Congress.  Momentum will continue to build towards passage, and I'm grateful to see the progress that has been made. But clearly, we still have a lot of work to do. The good news is that I ain't no ways tired!  With your support, we will continue the battle to protect consumers, and we will continue to fight until we win. You have my full support as you battle in the trenches for your client, and please know that you will always have an advocate in congress working with you to protect our clients! Thank you, and have a great training event!

144,April 17,Ayanna Pressley,D,Mass.-7,"WATCH: Pressley Urges De-Escalation in Middle East, Renews Call for Ceasefire in Gaza","April 17, 2024 “We now find ourselves at a critical inflection point: we can either leverage diplomacy to de-escalate tensions and push for peace, or we can stand idly by as this spirals into a broader regional conflict that will result in more loss of life…” “Make no mistake: history will remember this moment as a genocide.” Video (YouTube) WASHINGTON – Today, in a floor speech on the House floor, Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) called for urgent de-escalation in the Middle East and renewed her calls for a ceasefire in Gaza to prevent a broader regional war. The Congresswoman’s remarks come at a time of rising tensions in the Middle East, following the Iranian military’s attack on Israel as well as the Israeli military’s attack on the Iranian consulate in Syria. Since the horrific October 7th attack, Congresswoman Pressley has consistently and stridently called for a ceasefire to save lives, return all hostages, and surge humanitarian aid to Gaza. To date, nearly 34,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli airstrikes and over 100 hostages are still held captive by Hamas in Gaza. A transcript of the Congresswoman’s remarks is available below and the full video is available here. Transcript: In Floor Speech, Pressley Urges De-Escalation in Middle East, Renews Call for CeasefireU.S. House of RepresentativesApril 17, 2024 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention to the massacre of the Palestinian people and the urgent need to de-escalate the Middle East. For months now, after the brutal attack on October 7th, the world has watched in horror as the crisis in Gaza has worsened daily. Today, less than two hundred days later, nearly 34,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces. Every day that goes by without a ceasefire is another day that Palestinians are subjected to violence, starvation, death, and destruction. And every day that we do not de-escalate the region, more lives are put at risk. Mr. Speaker, I condemn the Iranian military’s attack on Israel and I condemn the Israeli military’s attack on the Iranian consulate in Syria.  These escalations are dangerous. And we now find ourselves at a critical inflection point. We can either leverage diplomacy to de-escalate tensions and push for peace, or we can stand idly by as this spirals into a broader regional conflict that will result in more loss of life – Palestinian, Israeli, and American. We must de-escalate. And facilitating a lasting ceasefire in the region is the only path forward. Some of my colleagues seem all too willing to rush into an endless war with Iran and continue providing a blank check to the Israeli military. Right now, Palestinians in Gaza are being starved, bombed, tortured and executed. Generations of Palestinian families have been wiped out. Over 2 million are displaced from homes that have been razed to the ground. Make no mistake: history will remember this moment as a genocide.  We cannot bomb our way to peace, and the U.S. must stop using our tax dollars to arm the Israeli military with more bombs and bullets. The same bombs and bullets that have been used to kill over 14,000 children in Gaza. Shameful. It’s why we see momentum across the globe in support of a ceasefire.  Millions are marching peacefully in the streets.  A ceasefire is the mandate. A ceasefire to surge humanitarian aid. A ceasefire to bring all the hostages home. A ceasefire to save lives. We will never be silent in the face of injustice.  Ceasefire now. ­— Throughout this conflict, Rep. Pressley has been a vocal and consistent advocate of diplomacy, de-escalation, and saving lives. ### Washington DC Office 402 Cannon HOB

145,April 3,Julia Brownley,D,Calif.-26,"Brownley Presents $963,000 to the County of Ventura for Regional Public Safety Radio Project","Ventura, CA – On Wednesday, April 3, Congresswoman Julia Brownley (D-CA) presented $963,000 to the County of Ventura to upgrade the region’s 15-year-old analog simulcast radio communications system. The funds will go toward establishing a state-of-the-art digital radio communication system which will utilize 700MHz frequencies. The upgraded radio system will be used by all public safety entities throughout the county to improve communications interoperability for public safety and first responder individuals as they respond to incidents and disasters. “The importance of ensuring our law enforcement and public safety entities in Ventura County have access to high-quality, reliable communications equipment cannot be overstated,” said Congresswoman Julia Brownley. “Not only will this state-of-the-art communication system facilitate better communication and coordination between agencies, but all of our cities and residents will benefit from streamlined services that will lower costs and redundancies. This is truly a win-win for everyone across the region. In advocating for this project, my motivation was to ensure that our renowned and sophisticated law enforcement, public safety professionals, and first responders have the renowned and sophisticated equipment they need to support their mission and their work.” Residents throughout Ventura County will benefit from the upgraded system as it will allow agencies at both the city and county level to access the latest communications technology and transform the current analog radio system to digital. As well, the new radio system includes substantial cost reductions to local agencies by preventing expensive and redundant investments in singular radio communications systems, providing centralized and more comprehensive support for the first responders radio system. “As a first responder, I can tell you every moment counts,” stated Ventura County Sheriff Jim Fryhoff. “These upgrades will improve communications interoperability across our first responder agencies and ultimately lead to faster and more comprehensive response to incidents in our community.” The regional system will broadcast from 19 towers across the county and communications from those on scene and enroute can be repeated. In the current state, radio traffic from cities can often not reach beyond their municipal borders, making it harder for them to coordinate mutual aid from outside agencies until they are within range. Additional advantages of the upgraded system include data and media transmission through cellular integration with other smart devices and connection with FirstNet for nationwide interoperability. “Our county has experienced a number of incidents that have demonstrated the importance of clear and timely communication across our public safety entities,” stated Ventura County Supervisor Janice Parvin, Vice Chair of the Board of Supervisors. “We are grateful for Congresswoman Brownley’s recognition of the importance of this project.”

149,April 16,Nanette Barragán,D,Calif.-44,Rep. Barragn Celebrates Passage ofOutdoorsforAllAct in House as part of EXPLORE Act,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 9 April 2024 Contact: Kevin G. McGuire | 202-538-2386 Kevin.mcguire@mail.house.gov WASHINGTON, DC – Today, Congresswoman Nanette Barragán (CA-44) celebrated the passage of her bill, the Outdoors for All Act, in the House of Representatives as part of the bipartisan Expanding Public Lands Outdoor Recreation Experiences (EXPLORE) Act. The Outdoors for All Act, authored by Congresswoman Barragán, codifies the Outdoor Recreation Legacy Partnership (ORLP) program in federal law and modernizes the program to include smaller cities, tribes, and to fully account for the benefits parks provide. The ORLP supports urban parks in underserved communities.  “I am so excited to see my bill included in the EXPLORE Act to help millions of Americans more easily access green spaces,” said Rep. Barragán. “By passing the Outdoors for All Act, we make it crystal clear that funding for urban parks is here to stay.  Growing up in the Harbor Gateway, I had to take a bus to travel to a park for baseball practice. Far too many low-income communities like the one I grew up in lack access to a nearby green space.  By preserving the ORLP, we can provide much needed urban park funding for underserved communities throughout our country.”  The EXPLORE Act now heads to the Senate, which has also passed a bipartisan outdoor recreation bill, which includes Outdoors for All, through committee.  “Trust for Public Land commends the House of Representatives for passing the Outdoors for All Act as part of the bipartisan EXPLORE ACT,” said Luis Benitez, Chief Impact Officer forTrust for Public Land. “This legislation is of critical importance in addressing the severe park access gap affecting 100 million Americans, including 28 million children. Access to the outdoorsis a fundamental human need, and parks are not mere amenities but essential public infrastructure crucial for fostering healthier, more connected communities. Today’s vote was a significant step toward achieving equitable outdoor recreation opportunities for all communities across the country.  Trust for Public Land thanks Rep. Nanette Barragán for her leadership on Outdoors for All.  Rep. Barragán co-sponsored the original legislation and has shepherded it through the House – she is a true trailblazer for the creation of parks for the communities that can benefit the most.”  “The National Recreation and Park Association (NRPA) is thrilled to see the House of Representatives pass the EXPLORE Act package, including the bipartisan Outdoors for All Act, which will ensure that the Outdoor Recreation Legacy Partnership (ORLP) Program has steady funding for generations to come,” said Kristine Stratton, CEO of NRPA. “This marks a huge step toward securing a win for our more than 60,000 members and advocates, who work tirelessly to serve the public through park and recreation opportunities in urban and rural communities throughout the country, preserving and protecting the outdoors. We now urge the Senate to swiftly pass this bipartisan, critical piece of legislation.” “Whether it’s inaccessible trails, a lack of parks within walking distance, or the increasing costs and confusion of permits and fees, many families struggle to safely or affordably access our public lands,” said Robert Scott, Deputy Federal Policy Director of the Sierra Club. “It is wonderful to see the House acknowledge the importance of outdoor access by passing Outdoors For All, as part of the EXPLORE Act and improving access to the great outdoors.”  “The Outdoors for All Act will give Americans without adequate park access, particularly those living in low-income areas and indigenous communities, greater opportunities to experience green spaces and public lands,” said Lesley Kane Szynal, Chair of the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) Coalition.  “This strengthens and codifies the LWCF-funded Outdoor Recreation Legacy Partnership (ORLP) program making Tribes and more local communities directly eligible to receive program dollars.” “The Outdoors for All Act will leverage the power of nature to benefit millions of underserved communities who have gone without adequate funding to access quality green spaces,” said Daniel Rossman, California Deputy Director at The Wilderness Society. “By ensuring that more people – regardless of race, income or geography – can benefit from our nation’s public lands, this legislation will also advance better health outcomes, boost local economies and increase climate resilience for communities that need it most.” “KABOOM! applauds the passage of the Outdoors For All Act and Every Kid Outdoors program extension within the EXPLORE Act,” said Lysa Ratliff, CEO of KABOOM! “Nature and nature-based play are vital to a child’s healthy physical and mental development. Programs which reduce systemic barriers to these activities are critically important to ensure every child can experience the benefits that access to nature provides. We want to thank the long-time champions of these programs for prioritizing kids having access to the outdoors.”  “It is great to see Congress acknowledge the importance of inclusive legislation and on a bipartisan level by passing the EXPLORE Act,” said Julia Hurwit, Campaign Manager forOAK. “Members of the Outdoors Alliance for Kids (OAK) are united by a shared mission to help more children, youth and families access the outdoors. The EXPLORE Act is going to provide a solid foundation for our work for the next few years by increasing the opportunities for children to access public lands, expanding options for families that want to spend time in nature, and offering safe and improved outdoor recreation amenities to communities.” “At REI Co-op we believe everyone should have easy access to nature, yet 100 million Americans lack access to a quality green space close to home,” said Taldi Harrison, Director of Community & Government Affairs, REI Co-op. “The EXPLORE Act, a first-of-its-kind package of outdoor recreation bills, will both strengthen our public lands and increase opportunities forall people to enjoy time outside. The bill centers bipartisan solutions that increase equitable access to the outdoors by increasing resources for outdoor recreation, including long-distance trails and urban parks in historically overlooked communities.” “We are thrilled to see Congress taking action to ensure each American has the opportunity to enjoy outdoor spaces in their own community, bolster economic growth, and advance mental and physical health benefits for all,” said Kent Ebersole, president of Outdoor Industry Association. “The outdoor recreation economy continues to soar to new levels, accounting for over $1 trillion in consumer spending and demonstrating participant growth for the eighth consecutive year. This is an important inflection point. We must modernize, preserve, and increase access to the public lands and waterways – regardless of where someone lives or works – and support more than five million employees who help drive our industry forward.”  # # # Congressmember Nanette Barragán represents California’s 44th District.  She sits on the House Energy and Commerce Committee and works on environmental justice and healthcare issues.  She is also Chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC).

150,April 14,Paul Gosar,R,Ariz.-9,This Week With Gosar,"This Week With Gosar April 14, 2024     Gosar Votes Against Spy Bill, Overwhelming Majority Polled Oppose FISA This week, I voted against legislation reauthorizing Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) for two more years.   A few months ago, I wrote an Op-Ed expressing my concerns about reauthorizing FISA without significant reform.  If you missed it, here it is!  Backup: Section 702 of FISA was enacted by Congress in 2008 to ostensibly allow the United States intelligence community, including the FBI, to surveil foreigners located abroad. Purportedly, Congress wrote this law to protect our national security by allowing spying on non-U.S. threats without a court order. However, FISA was never intended to spy on U.S. citizens.    Unfortunately, Section 702 has been controversial since its inception, and it has been highly scrutinized by civil liberties advocates and privacy rights activists.   The government's ability to collect and analyze the communications of foreigners without a warrant has also led to the collection of communications of American citizens and raises serious concerns about the indiscriminate and broad nature of the surveillance program, further infringing on the rights of Americans.   For example, the FBI has abused Section 702 to conduct warrantless searches against American citizens more than 278,000 times.  Unless it is reauthorized by Congress, FISA is set to expire next Friday.  Now that you’re up to speed, several amendments were offered that would have reformed FISA including a commonsense amendment offered by my friend, Representative Biggs, that I voted for that would have prevented warrantless searches of Americans.  Sadly, 86 Republicans and 126 Democrats inexplicably voted to allow the deep state to continue spying on Americans without a warrant by voting down this amendment.   As a result, I could not support the warrantless surveillance of American reauthorized under section 702.  It is a clear overreach of authority and is a direct violation of the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures.  Earlier this week and before voting, I sent a flash poll to faithful Gosar Newsletter readers asking you to share your opinion on whether FISA should be reauthorized.  2,367 individuals voted and here are the results:  🔢 2216 (96%) urged that I vote against reauthorizing FISA; 🔢 95 (4%) asked that I vote to reauthorize FISA; 🔢 10 (less than 1%) were undecided.  Thank you to everyone who responded to my poll!   Click here to read my press release further explaining why I voted against reauthorizing FISA.     Democrats Oppose Adding Citizenship Question to Census This week, the House Oversight and Accountability Committee on which I serve passed H.R. 7109, the Equal Representation Act, legislation to add a new question to the decennial census.    ❓❓Congressman Gosar: what was the question, you might ask? ❓❓  Are you a citizen? YES or NO.   Not surprisingly, every Democrat on the committee voted against this commonsense legislation.   Currently, the decennial census counts illegal aliens for purposes of reapportionment and allocating congressional seats. Thus, states that harbor illegal aliens will have their population numbers increased. With a population increase, those states may well get additional congressional seats in the House of Representatives and other states will lose seats.  The surge of illegal aliens will generally benefit blue states and cause Congress to have an artificially high number of Democrat congressional districts.   Illegal immigration is a crime. Why are we awarding those who break our laws with Congressional representation?  Because Democrats would rather have a wide-open southern border than a safe America. This is being done intentionally. It’s all about power.  Now that it has been voted out of committee, H.R. 7109, the Equal Representation Act, now goes to the House floor for a vote by every Member of Congress.  I will be sure to keep you updated!    Congress Passes Bill Improving Access to Outdoor Recreation on Public Lands  Also this week, Congress passed H.R. 6492, the Expanding Public Lands Outdoor Recreation Experiences Act, or the EXPLORE Act.  The EXPLORE Act makes it easier for every American to enjoy our beautiful public lands and waters by promoting recreation opportunities for active service members and veterans, creating new long-distance bike trails, improving access for sportsmen and women, streamlining permitting for outfitters and guides, protecting rock climbing in iconic places, modernizing campgrounds, and much more.  Our nation is blessed with some of the most beautiful lands and waters in the world, it is only right that Congress makes them available for all Americans to enjoy.  🚴 🎣 🛶 🏃‍♀️ 🧗 🏂 ⛺🌲   Congress Passes Legislation Long Championed by Gosar to Build Veterans Center in Gila County This week the House passed H.R. 1829, legislation I cosponsored with Representative Crane requiring the Secretary of Agriculture to convey the Pleasant Valley Ranger District Administrative Site to Gila County, Arizona.  This bill would utilize 232 acres located in northern Arizona to build a veterans retreat and community center by transferring the Pleasant Valley Administrative Site and accompanying Forest Service land to Gila County.  The community center will provide a gathering space for veterans and their families to host retreats, meetings, and other events. The area would also serve as a location for a mobile veterans’ clinic for veterans who cannot easily access a VA Medical Center.   Completing this land transfer will open the door for new support services for veterans in northern Arizona.  For years, I have long-championed this bipartisan cause and I am very pleased that this effort is gaining momentum.     Gosar Hosts Successful Military Academy Day Thank you to all the High School Juniors, Seniors and parents who attended my Military Academy Day earlier this week to learn more about how to receive a congressional nomination to a United States military service academy.  I am very impressed with the qualifications of the students and wish them all the best as they pursue an appointment.     It’s Mail Time! I’ve received a ton of mail each week and I appreciate hearing from everyone, including those who disagree.  Here are samples of some of the letters sent in this week:  📨 Frank Z. from Prescott, AZ is a frequent critic who shared this incredibly intelligent comment this week 😂: MORON!!!!  👉 Frank, thanks for the very “thoughtful” remark.  I will share with you the same advice I used to give my children: act your age, not your shoe size!    📨 Robert M. from Goodyear, AZ writes✏: I am not in favor of the renewal of FISA and can’t believe Mike Johnson cast the deciding vote for it. We need to sharply curtail the power of the federal government to spy on US citizens since it’s clear that the government is incapable of keeping politics out of their decisions.  👉 Dear Robert, I won’t sugar-coat it: I too am in disbelief of the vote. As I noted above, there were several good amendments that would have reformed FISA, none more important than an amendment that, if passed, would have required a warrant to spy on Americans.  It failed, 212-212 was the final tally.  In Congress, a tie means the vote fails.  There are no tiebreakers.  One additional vote was all that was needed, yet the Speaker voted with the UNIPARTY causing the amendment to fail.   📨 Cynthia W. from Kingman, AZ shares, in part, this note: Anyone harmed by the COVID vaccine should be allowed to be compensated by the manufacturer of the product. We must hold these companies responsible. Right now, Americans cannot sue a manufacturer or health provider if they or a family member are injured or killed by a COVID product. There have been well over one million claims of injury and death from COVID products reported. The COVID shot – in just over three years – racked up as many VAERS reports as all other vaccines combined since 1988. COVID products wouldn’t exist if manufacturers could be sued for harm.  The CDC continues to recommend COVID shots for our children, even though many countries, including Britain, France, Japan, Australia, and India, decided not to recommend boosters, or any shot at all for healthy children. This issue is not going away, and Americans are being harmed by not having the constitutional protection of trial by jury.   👉 Cynthia, there is ample evidence of the existence of injuries caused by vaccines.  Unfortunately, the Big Pharma lobby has prevented the U.S. government from collecting quality statistics of vaccine injuries, instead relying on the inadequate Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting system, which is compiled from self-reporting.     The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 makes it almost impossible for those harmed by vaccines to sue Big Pharma in court.     I don’t believe that pharmaceutical companies should get a special carve-out.  Most producers of other market materials can be sued for defects caused by their products.  That is why I am considering action, including legislation, to level the playing field by making vaccine manufacturers responsible for the injuries and harms caused by their vaccines.   Tweet of the Week:   Photo of the Week:

151,April 14,Jim Himes,D,Conn.-4,Himes Statement on Iranian Attack Against Israel,"Stamford, CT – Today, Congressman Jim Himes (CT-04) issued the following statement regarding Iran’s attacks on Israel: “The United States is resolute in our support for the Israeli people and our condemnation of the Iranian attacks. I applaud President Biden and our men and women in uniform for working so effectively with Israeli and other partners to intercept the vast majority of Iranian drones and missiles, doubtlessly saving countless lives.

152,April 15,Jamaal Bowman,D,N.Y.-16,NEWS: REP. BOWMAN STATEMENT ON MILITARY ESCALATION IN THE MIDDLE EAST," For Immediate Release Congressman Jamaal Bowman Ed.D. (NY-16) released the following statement: In this critical moment, we need to engage with peace, not weapons. I unequivocally condemn the Iranian military’s attack on Israel, just as I condemn the Israeli military attack on the Iranian consulate in Syria ordered by Prime Minister Netanyahu that sparked this dangerous escalation. While there were no fatalities, shrapnel from an Iranian missile did severely injure Amina al-Hassouni, the seven-year old Bedouin girl, and I am praying for her swift recovery. I am deeply concerned by those demanding military reprisal. That is why I stand in support of President Biden’s immediate call to de-escalate this situation, and his actions to prevent the further spread of violence in the region. It is clearer than ever that Benjamin Netanyahu’s warmongering is putting the lives of millions of civilians at risk, including the Israeli people. It is why even as I condemned Hamas’ horrific attacks on October 7, I also called for immediate de-escalation and a ceasefire. We cannot condemn violence on one hand and then condone it in the other. The collective punishment leveled against the Palestinian people as well as Israeli military actions in Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, and Iraq have created a dangerous powder keg that threatens to become a regional war. Netanyahu is willing to endanger the lives of millions just to draw the US deeper into a conflict whose flame he fans. The path to peace starts with ensuring safety for people in the region. A majority of Americans want a permanent ceasefire, and support for Netanyahu in both the US and Israel shrinks by the day. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are starving to death in Gaza right now, including tens of thousands of children. Millions across the region fear being drawn into a bloody conflict orchestrated by madmen. Antisemitism and Islamophobia are on the rise in our very own country. We need de-escalation, restraint, a lasting ceasefire, and diplomacy. It is the only way forward, not just for Palestinians and Israelis, but us all.

155,April 14,Cori Bush,D,Mo.-1,Congresswoman Bush Statement on Escalation of Violence in Middle East,"  Washington D.C. (Apr. 14, 2024) — Congresswoman Cori Bush (MO-01) released the following statement: “I am deeply concerned by the Iranian military’s attack on Israel, which comes in response to the Israeli military’s attack on the Iranian Embassy in Syria. I condemn these attacks, which threaten civilian lives and regional war. I also condemn the calls by Members of Congress and others to initiate war with Iran; to do so without Congressional authorization is blatantly unconstitutional. I’m encouraged by reporting that President Biden advised Prime Minister Netanyahu last night that the U.S. will oppose any Israeli counter-attacks against Iran, and I urge the President to continue to take immediate steps, including at the UN Security Council and G7, to de-escalate and facilitate an immediate, lasting ceasefire in the region.     “Since the horrific October 7 attack, I have repeatedly urged an end to the violence through de-escalation, ceasefire, and diplomacy and cautioned that war is never the answer. Instead, the U.S. government has shamefully and unconditionally armed the Israeli government as it has committed war crimes, killed over 33,000 Palestinians, inflicted famine in Gaza, violated domestic and international laws, and increased the chances of regional war. This failed approach must end.  “The people of our country do not want war. They want to live in a world that is safe, peaceful, and just. That is why our pro-peace, pro-humanity movement is stronger than ever, and it’s why, as recently as last week, dozens of my colleagues and I called for our government to stop arming Netanyahu’s maniacal, genocidal acts. We are pushing for the safety of all people, from Palestinians and Israelis abroad to Jewish, Arab, Muslim, and other communities who are being targeted here at home, to the release of all hostages and those arbitrarily detained, and ending the risk of a regional war that further entangles the United States and jeopardizes the safety of our people. We cannot let the warmongers win; our country and our world are calling for restraint, de-escalation, a lasting ceasefire, and diplomacy. Our government must listen. That is how we save lives.” On April 1, 2024, the Israeli government bombed an Iranian embassy complex in Damascus, Syria, killing 16 people. In retaliation, the Iranian military launched an attack on Israel using drones and missiles on April 13. Since October 7, 2023, over 33,000 Palestinians and 1,100 Israelis have been killed, 76,000 Palestinians have been injured, dozens of hostages have been killed, and over 100 Israelis and thousands of Palestinians remain unlawfully detained.  ###",Congress Progressive,"['washington apr', 'congresswoman cori bush released following statement deeply concerned iranian military attack israel come response israeli military attack iranian embassy syria', 'condemn attack threaten civilian life regional war', 'also condemn call member congress others initiate war iran without congressional authorization blatantly unconstitutional', 'encouraged reporting president biden advised prime minister netanyahu last night oppose israeli iran urge president continue take immediate step including un security council facilitate immediate lasting ceasefire region', 'since horrific october attack repeatedly urged end violence ceasefire diplomacy cautioned war never answer', 'instead government shamefully unconditionally armed israeli government committed war crime killed palestinian inflicted famine gaza violated domestic international law increased chance regional war', 'failed approach must end', 'people country want war', 'want live world safe peaceful', 'movement stronger ever recently last week dozen colleague called government stop arming netanyahu maniacal genocidal act', 'pushing safety people palestinian israeli abroad jewish arab muslim community targeted home release hostage arbitrarily detained ending risk regional war entangles united state jeopardizes safety people', 'let warmonger win country world calling restraint lasting ceasefire diplomacy', 'government must listen', 'save april israeli government bombed iranian embassy complex damascus syria killing people', 'retaliation iranian military launched attack israel using drone missile april', 'since october palestinian israeli killed palestinian injured dozen hostage killed israeli thousand palestinian remain unlawfully detained', '']",washington apr congresswoman cori bush released following statement deeply concerned iranian military attack israel come response israeli military attack iranian embassy syria condemn attack threaten civilian life regional war also condemn call member congress others initiate war iran without congressional authorization blatantly unconstitutional encouraged reporting president biden advised prime minister netanyahu last night oppose israeli iran urge president continue take immediate step including un security council facilitate immediate lasting ceasefire region since horrific october attack repeatedly urged end violence ceasefire diplomacy cautioned war never answer instead government shamefully unconditionally armed israeli government committed war crime killed palestinian inflicted famine gaza violated domestic international law increased chance regional war failed approach must end people country want war want live world safe peaceful movement stronger ever recently last week dozen colleague called government stop arming netanyahu maniacal genocidal act pushing safety people palestinian israeli abroad jewish arab muslim community targeted home release hostage arbitrarily detained ending risk regional war entangles united state jeopardizes safety people let warmonger win country world calling restraint lasting ceasefire diplomacy government must listen save april israeli government bombed iranian embassy complex damascus syria killing people retaliation iranian military launched attack israel using drone missile april since october palestinian israeli killed palestinian injured dozen hostage killed israeli thousand palestinian remain unlawfully detained
156,April 15,Bonnie Watson Coleman,D,N.J.-12,Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman Introduces Gig Is Up Act to End Exploitation of Gig Workers,"Today, Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman (NJ-12) introduced the Gig Is Up Act, which would push companies to treat gig workers fairly.  The bill would require companies with at least $100 million in revenues, and that employ at least 10,000 independent contractors, to pay for both the employer’s and the worker’s payroll tax contributions to Social Security and Medicare. Under the current system, the gig worker must pay for both. This new requirement for large companies would create an incentive to accurately classify these workers as employees, instead of forcing workers to shoulder the entire burden. “These people work hard. They generate millions of dollars in value for large tech companies, but they’ve been denied the basic benefits afforded to traditional employees,” said Rep. Watson Coleman. “Wealthy corporations have abused the system and these workers, who often struggle to support their families. ‘Honest work for fair pay.’ That’s the deal. This legislation ensures corporations hold up their end of the bargain.” “It's shameful that companies continue to misclassify their workers to avoid providing them with essential benefits,” said Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib (MI-12) “We must close the legal loopholes that allow massive companies to continue these exploitative practices. That's why I'm so proud to join Congresswoman Watson Coleman in support of this critical legislation.” “For too long, large companies and multinational corporations have taken advantage of workers based on their classification as independent contractors,"" said Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky (IL-09). ""Today we say the gig is up! I am proud to join my friend and colleague Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman in introducing the Gig Is Up Act to ensure that companies prioritize people over profits by paying workers fair compensation and providing the benefits that they have earned."" ""Every employee in this country deserves a living wage and sufficient benefits for themselves and their families,” said Rep. Shri Thanedar (MI-13). “Currently, millions of gig workers like ride-share drivers, food delivery workers, and more are being taken advantage of by their corporate employers. By finally forcing billionaire CEOs to pay their fair share, every worker can get what they deserve!"" ""Big companies like Uber and Lyft keep profits to themselves by misclassifying their workers, shirking all responsibility for benefits and decent wages in favor of precarious gig work,” said AFT President Randi Weingarten. “This is a targeted and malicious practice that leaves workers shouldering what should be a large corporation’s obligation to contribute their share of payroll taxes to Social Security and Medicare. The Gig Is Up Act confronts this injustice by pushing these companies to treat their workers as employees, with all the rights and respect that affords them. American families can’t build a decent life by cobbling together gig work — it’s time for big employers to pay their fair share."" “NEA is proud to endorse the Gig Is Up Act which would rightfully place the responsibility for payroll taxes on the multimillion dollar corporations not their gig workers. It’s unconscionable that the gig workers who have made these companies successful are responsible for paying the corporation’s share of payroll taxes,” said Marc Egan, Director of Government Relations at the National Education Association. “It’s time for these corporations to step up and treat their workers who are essential to their existence with respect.” ""Social Security Works is proud to support the Gig Is Up Act. This legislation takes much-needed steps to hold corporations accountable for exploiting their workers by misclassifying them as independent contractors,” said Executive Director Alex Lawson. “By requiring these corporations to pay their fair share into Social Security and Medicare, the Gig Is Up Act ensures that workers will receive their earned benefits. Thank you Rep. Watson Coleman for fighting for working people!"" “Large tech corporations like Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash have been chasing profit by paying dangerously low wages, denying people a meaningful voice in their working conditions, and shirking their responsibility for paying into social insurance funds that contribute to the safety and well-being of the working people they depend upon— workers who are disproportionately immigrants and people of color,” said Laura Padin, Director of Work Structures at National Employment Law Project (NELP). “NELP applauds Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman for reintroducing the Gig Is Up Act and requiring large corporations to contribute to Social Security and Medicare for the working people who are essential to their businesses.” “Congress should pass the Gig Is Up Act to ensure Medicare and Social Security benefits are adequately funded by large employers who retain gig economy workers,” said Trudy Goldberg, chair of the National Jobs for All Network. “It’s shocking and unacceptable that large companies are currently allowed to misclassify workers and evade their ethical responsibility to provide the adequate retirement and medical benefits that all workers deserve.” The Gig Is up Act is cosponsored by Representatives Eleanor Holmes Norton (DC-At Large), Rashida Tlaib (MI-12), André Carson (IN-07), Jan Schakowsky (IL-09), Jamaal Bowman (NY-16), Shri Thanedar (MI-13), Jahana Hayes (CT-05), Barbara Lee (CA-12), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (NY-14), Summer Lee (PA-12), Delia Ramirez (IL-03), and Robert Menendez, Jr. (NJ-08). It is supported by: Social Security Works, Transport Workers Union of America, Communication Workers of America, American Federation of Teachers, National Education Association, People’s Action, National Employment Law Project, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, National Jobs for All Network, Progressive Change Campaign Committee.

157,April 15,Mike Levin,D,Calif.-49,Rep. Mike Levin Calls on Speaker Johnson to Bring Maritime Border Security Bill to House Floor Immediately,"Washington, D.C. – Today, Rep. Mike Levin (CA-49) released the following statement calling on House Speaker Mike Johnson to immediately bring H.R. 529, the Extending Limits of U.S. Customs Waters Act, to the House floor for a vote. Last year, Rep. Levin met with CBP’s Air and Marine Operations (AMO) to learn about agents’ work to secure our maritime borders and hear directly about how he can support that work. During the discussion, AMO agents highlighted the importance of extending U.S. customs waters and shared how it will help them carry out their mission. “Recent incidents of unidentified vessels landing onshore in our district have underscored the urgency of bringing H.R. 529 to the House floor for a vote. This bill would double the range in which Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents can operate to address migrants and other vessels arriving by water along our coast. It would extend U.S. customs waters from 12 to 24 nautical miles, providing CBP with additional support to accomplish its duties, including interdicting drugs and addressing issues with migration, effectively and efficiently. “Last month, I voted in favor of a government funding package that will increase resources to CBP and provide the agency with updated tools and enforcement mechanisms, but there’s still more we must do to address our broken immigration system and support law enforcement officials. “Last week, Speaker Johnson was unable to bring H.R. 529 to the House floor as originally planned because of chaos within the House Republican Conference. He needs to stop playing games and Republican politicians need to stop with the political theater. If Speaker Johnson and the Republican Party care about solving our immigration crisis, stopping the flow of illegal fentanyl, and securing our borders like they claim, then they must bring this bill to the floor immediately. We need bipartisan, pragmatic solutions. This is one of them. I look forward to voting in favor of this bill.” ###",Congress Progressive,"['washington today mike levin released following statement calling house speaker mike johnson immediately bring', 'extending limit custom water act house floor vote', 'last year levin met cbp air marine operation amo learn agent work secure maritime border hear directly support work', 'discussion amo agent highlighted importance extending custom water shared help carry mission', 'recent incident unidentified vessel landing onshore district underscored urgency bringing', 'house floor vote', 'bill would double range custom border protection cbp agent operate address migrant vessel arriving water along coast', 'would extend custom water nautical mile providing cbp additional support accomplish duty including interdicting drug addressing issue migration effectively efficiently', 'last month voted favor government funding package increase resource cbp provide agency updated tool enforcement mechanism still must address broken immigration system support law enforcement official', 'last week speaker johnson unable bring', 'house floor originally planned chaos within house republican conference', 'need stop playing game republican politician need stop political theater', 'speaker johnson republican party care solving immigration crisis stopping flow illegal fentanyl securing border like claim must bring bill floor immediately', 'need bipartisan pragmatic solution', 'one', 'look forward voting favor']",washington today mike levin released following statement calling house speaker mike johnson immediately bring extending limit custom water act house floor vote last year levin met cbp air marine operation amo learn agent work secure maritime border hear directly support work discussion amo agent highlighted importance extending custom water shared help carry mission recent incident unidentified vessel landing onshore district underscored urgency bringing house floor vote bill would double range custom border protection cbp agent operate address migrant vessel arriving water along coast would extend custom water nautical mile providing cbp additional support accomplish duty including interdicting drug addressing issue migration effectively efficiently last month voted favor government funding package increase resource cbp provide agency updated tool enforcement mechanism still must address broken immigration system support law enforcement official last week speaker johnson unable bring house floor originally planned chaos within house republican conference need stop playing game republican politician need stop political theater speaker johnson republican party care solving immigration crisis stopping flow illegal fentanyl securing border like claim must bring bill floor immediately need bipartisan pragmatic solution one look forward voting favor
158,April 15,Barbara Lee,D,Calif.-12,"Congresswoman Barbara Lee, Tri-Caucus Leaders Call on Small Business Administration to Publish Complete Minority Contracting Data","WASHINGTON, DC – Congresswoman Barbara Lee (CA-12) and Tri-Caucus Leaders Reps. Steven Horsford (NV-4), Judy Chu (CA-28), and Nanette Barragán (CA-44) led a letter Friday with over 40 House Democrats to the Small Business Administration urging Administrator Guzman to publish a complete version of federal contracting spending data broken down by race and ethnicity. The administration published this kind of data for the first time in December 2021, but the data released in January 2024 for FY2021 and FY2022 has thus far been limited to the top five agencies. The lawmakers, who lead the Congressional Black Caucus, Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, underscored the economic impact federal contracting dollars can have on minority-owned small businesses and communities of color.  “We urge the SBA to completely deliver on its 2021 commitment to publish data, disaggregated by race and ethnicity, on government contracts issued to Small Disadvantaged Businesses for every federal agency, not just the top five,” the lawmakers wrote. “We ask that you publish this data for Fiscal Years 2021, 2022 and 2023 before April 30, 2024.” They continued, “In fiscal year 2020, the federal government spent more than $665 billion on contracts. But minority-owned businesses often struggle to win federal contracts, depriving those companies and communities of billions of dollars in opportunities. According to one study, had minority-owned businesses received FY20 federal contracting dollars in proportion to their share of the US business sector, they would have received $64 billion more in federal contracts. Black-owned businesses specifically would have received an additional $4 billion in contract awards and Hispanic-owned businesses almost $24 billion more.” “In 2021, President Biden committed to addressing this inequity through increasing federal contracting with Small Disadvantaged Businesses to 15% in FY25. Under your leadership, SBA has affirmed that the SBA Scorecard will reflect those milestones. As members of Congress, we write to remind your administration of this commitment and reiterate that publishing this data for all federal agencies will help legislators to understand the needs of America’s 33.2 million small businesses while fostering greater economic opportunity for marginalized groups.” Disaggregated data on race and ethnicity would show how these federal contracting awards for small businesses are being divided across racial and ethnic categories — Black and African American, Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander, Hispanic and Latino, Native American, and other minority-owned small businesses – to monitor equity and progress at a time when transparency is key to understanding the disparities faced by minority-owned small businesses.

159,April 15,David Rouzer,R,N.C.-7,"Rouzer, Valadao, Costa, Slotkin Launch Bipartisan Specialty Crops Caucus","WASHINGTON, DC - Today, Congressman David Rouzer (R-NC), Congressman David Valadao (R-CA), Congressman Jim Costa (D-CA), and Congresswoman Elissa Slotkin (D-MI) announced the launch of the bipartisan Congressional Specialty Crops Caucus.   The caucus aims to highlight the issues facing the specialty crop industry and advocate for policies to allow U.S. specialty growers, processors, and partners to succeed by providing American families with a safe, affordable, and nutritious food supply. “North Carolina produces more than ninety commodities, providing fresh produce and ornamentals to consumers around the world,"" said Congressman Rouzer.  ""The unique challenges faced by the specialty crop industry deserve to be heard when debating farm policy in Congress.  The Specialty Crops Caucus will help enhance this industry’s voice to better ensure these issues can be properly addressed."" “With inflation, competition, and the Farm Bill ahead of us, it is important to have the priorities of specialty crops recognized,” said Lee Kimball, partner and sales director at Somerfield Farms in Wilmington, North Carolina. “We appreciate the leadership of Rep. Rouzer and look forward to working with him and the Congressional Specialty Crops Caucus to ensure our priorities are protected and we can continue the important work of helping feed the country.”  Specialty crops include fruits and tree nuts, vegetables, horticulture, herbs, nursery crops, and other ornamentals such as Christmas trees and floriculture.  Specialty crops account for more than one-third of farm gate value, represent 2.2 million jobs across all 50 states, and contributed $120.6 billion in labor income to the American economy last year.  The caucus will collaborate on legislation to support specialty crop producers and address issues such as market access, research funding, and sustainability measures. “Specialty crop producers have faced many challenges over the last few years,” said Congressman Valadao. “From supply chain backlogs at our ports, rising input costs, labor shortages, and drought; our producers have continued to supply the world with fresh, nutritious food despite these obstacles. Specialty crops are a cornerstone of California agriculture, and we need to ensure these producers are supported at the federal level. I’m excited to be co-chairing the Specialty Crops Caucus to ensure our specialty crop producers have a seat at the table in Washington.”  “California is the leading producer of specialty crops, with over 400 different crops. Any Farm Bill must include strong, bipartisan support for specialty crops,” said Costa. This caucus will continue advocating for policies that allow Specialty Crop growers to continue providing American families with safe, healthy foods.” “Here in Michigan, specialty crops – from cherries, to asparagus, to beans – are our bread and butter, and the reason that we’re America’s most agriculturally diverse state with reliable access to water,” said Slotkin. “It’s critical that we protect and support the next generation of farmers – including small farmers. That is why I’m joining my colleagues to launch the bipartisan Congressional Specialty Crops Caucus. This is a group that will look out for the farmers that are often lost in the agriculture conversation in Washington, and make sure they’re represented on every page of the Farm Bill.”  Click here for

161,April 15,Salud Carbajal,D,Calif.-24,"In Wake of Iran Attack and Amid Increasing Need in Gaza and Ukraine, Rep. Carbajal Joins Bipartisan Call for Speaker to Allow Vote on Senate-Passed National Security Funding Package","On Sunday night, Congressman Salud Carbajal joined a bipartisan group of 91 Members of Congress imploring Speaker of the House Mike Johnson to allow a vote on the bipartisan national security funding package, which passed the Senate in February, in order to provide critical aid to Ukraine and Israel as well as deliver much-needed humanitarian aid to Palestinian civilians in Gaza. “The inaction of the House on this aid package is unacceptable, now more than ever. In the past week, we have seen Israel come under direct attack by Iran, using the defensive weapon systems that this aid package supports to prevent further loss of life. We have seen worsening conditions in Gaza increase the already desperate need for Congress to approve humanitarian aid. And our lack of additional support for Ukraine has given Vladimir Putin renewed cause to believe we have turned our back on the Ukrainian people,” said Rep. Carbajal. “I commend the President’s continued efforts to stand with our allies and partners and to prevent wider wars around the world, but President Biden’s diplomatic efforts alone cannot meet our national security challenges. The House must be allowed the chance to debate and vote on this critical aid package, which has languished for too long after enjoying widespread bipartisan support in the Senate.” In the wake of Iran’s direct attack on Israel this past weekend and increasingly perilous conditions in Gaza and Ukraine, Rep. Carbajal and his colleagues called for a vote as soon as Monday evening. “Time is of the essence,” the members wrote. “We urge you to put the Senate Supplemental Aid package on the floor for an immediate vote when we return on Monday. This aid package passed the Senate with 70 votes, Democrats and Republicans, and we can send it to the President’s desk for signature Monday night.” The full letter can be found here. As a Vice Chair of the New Democrat Coalition, Rep. Carbajal has been a leader in pushing for Congressional action on President Biden’s supplemental request for security and humanitarian aid in support of Israel, Ukraine, and Taiwan, as well as humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians in Gaza and funding to help address immigration backlogs and security challenges at the U.S. southern border. Rep. Carbajal has been pushing for consideration of this bill since February, emphasizing its potential to save lives in the short and long term. He has also been pushing the Biden Administration to help scale up efforts to deliver life-saving aid to Palestinian civilians in Gaza, seek the renewal of a humanitarian ceasefire, secure the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas, and emphasize to Israel the need for a strategy that protects civilian life. In addition, Rep. Carbajal has voiced concerns to President Biden over Israel’s military operational strategies, and signed a resolution calling for a renewal of a humanitarian ceasefire that had previously helped facilitate safe delivery of humanitarian aid and the release of hostages being held by Hamas.

162,April 15,Salud Carbajal,D,Calif.-24,President Biden Approves Rep. Carbajal Push To Unlock Additional Federal Aid for Central Coast Communities Impacted by Recent Storms,"Congressman Salud Carbajal (CA-24) thanked President Biden for approving California Governor Gavin Newsom’s request for a major disaster declaration, which will unlock additional federal storm aid for Central Coast communities impacted by recent winters storms, flooding, and other extreme weather. “I am grateful to President Biden and his administration for recognizing the severity of the storms that the Central Coast faced this winter and approving our request for additional federal support,” said Rep. Carbajal. “My team and I will work with our federal, state, and local partners to ensure these additional resources can be used to perform the repairs needed to fully repair our region.” On Saturday, President Biden approved the federal disaster declaration for San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Ventura, and six other California counties to unlock Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funding for repairing damages from storms, flooding, landslides, mudslides, and tornadoes that occurred between January 31 and February 9, 2024 in Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Ventura and other select California counties. Rep. Carbajal had personally urged President Biden to approve the request for additional federal support in a letter sent three weeks ago. In his letter, Rep. Carbajal detailed the damage seen across the Central Coast: “In the City of San Luis Obispo, the storm caused severe damage to eight steel firehouse rollup bay doors. In Santa Barbara County, the County experienced severe cold temperatures, snow in higher elevations, flooding, among other extreme weather. At the San Marcos Pass, Santa Barbara County rainfall gauges measured nine inches of rain and four inches of rain in the City of Santa Barbara within a 24-hour period. This prompted Santa Barbara County to issue a flash flood warning. Additionally, Mission Canyon and Mission Creek experienced severe erosion, causing retaining walls to collapse. In Ventura County, residents also experienced extensive flooding. This led to serious damage to our roadways, bridges, and other water infrastructure. Mudslides blocked State Route 33 in the Los Padres National Forest.” The major disaster declaration unlocks Public Assistance from FEMA for state, local, and tribal governments to support debris removal, emergency protective measures, and other emergency infrastructure and work measures on the Central Coast and elsewhere in California.  Rep. Carbajal helped petition the Biden Administration to unlock federal aid for communities impacted by repeated atmospheric rivers and extreme weather last winter.

Valadao (R-CA), Jim Costa (D-CA), David Rouzer (R-NC), and Elissa Slotkin (D-MI) announced the reestablishment of the bipartisan Congressional Specialty Crops Caucus. The caucus is dedicated to highlighting the issues facing the specialty crop industry and building support for policies that allow U.S. specialty growers, processors, and partners to prosper by providing American families with safe, affordable, and nutritious foods. “Specialty crop producers have faced many challenges over the last few years,” said Congressman Valadao. “From supply chain backlogs at our ports, rising input costs, labor shortages, and drought; our producers have continued to supply the world with fresh, nutritious food despite these obstacles. Specialty crops are a cornerstone of California agriculture, and we need to ensure these producers are supported at the federal level. I’m excited to be co-chairing the Specialty Crops Caucus to ensure our specialty crop producers have a seat at the table in Washington.”  “California is the leading producer of specialty crops, with over 400 different crops. Any Farm Bill must include strong, bipartisan support for specialty crops,” said Congressman Costa. “This caucus will continue advocating for policies that allow Specialty Crop growers to continue providing American families with safe, healthy foods.” Specialty crops include fruits and vegetables, tree nuts, dried fruits, horticulture, and nursery crops. Critical to our nation’s food security, diverse agricultural landscape, and economy, specialty crops account for more than one-third of farm gate value, represent 2.2 million jobs across all 50 states, and contributed $120.6 billion in labor income to the American economy last year. The caucus will work to introduce and support legislation that benefits specialty crop producers and address issues such as market access, research funding, and sustainability measures. “North Carolina produces more than ninety commodities, providing fresh produce and ornamentals to consumers around the world.  The unique challenges faced by the specialty crop industry deserve to be heard when debating farm policy in Congress.  The Specialty Crops Caucus will help enhance this industry’s voice to better ensure these issues can be properly addressed,” said Congressman Rouzer.  “Here in Michigan, specialty crops – from cherries, to asparagus, to beans – are our bread and butter, and the reason that we’re America’s most agriculturally diverse state with reliable access to water,” said Congresswoman Slotkin. “It’s critical that we protect and support the next generation of farmers – including small farmers. That is why I’m joining my colleagues to launch the bipartisan Congressional Specialty Crops Caucus. This is a group that will look out for the farmers that are often lost in the agriculture conversation in Washington, and make sure they’re represented on every page of the Farm Bill.”  In recent years, Congress has worked on a bipartisan basis to combat unreasonable specialty crop trade barriers, increase access to automation technology, and help producers break into niche American markets. The Specialty Crop Caucus is dedicated to building on this foundation and supporting the interests of specialty crop production. Specialty crop producers in California are applauding the co-chairs for their leadership in Congress to raise awareness about the significant contributions and unique needs of the industry.  “The establishment of the Congressional Specialty Crop Caucus means we will have allies in Washington who understand our issues and the needs for a strong agriculture economy,” said Jeff Huckaby, the president and CEO of Grimmway in Bakersfield, California. “We are thrilled that Rep. Valadao has stepped up on behalf of specialty crops, and we look forward to working with him to ensure progress for our industry and the agriculture industry.”  ",Main Street,"['subscribe receive

166,April 15,Michael Waltz,R,Fla.-6,"Waltz, Soto, and Rubio Introduce the Jackie Robinson Ballpark Commemorative Site Act","WASHINGTON, D.C. – On Monday, U.S. Congressmen Mike Waltz (FL-06) and Darren Soto (FL-09) introduced the bipartisan, bicameral Jackie Robinson Ballpark Commemorative Site Act to honor the location where Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier and played his first professional game. Under this legislation, the Jackie Robinson Ballpark and home the Daytona Tortugas, would be designated as a National Commemorative Site and direct the Secretary of Interior to conduct a feasibility study to give the site the designation of National Historic Landmark. U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (FL-R) will introduce companion legislation in the Senate. The bill is co-sponsored by the entire Florida House delegation and has the support from both Major and Minor League Baseball. “Jackie Robinson changed the course of history forever on March 17, 1946 in Daytona Beach when he set foot in the then-named Daytona City Island Ballpark,” said Waltz. “Since that day, Daytona Beach’s ballpark has been a historic landmark and reminder of Jackie Robinson, the Civil Rights Movement, and the integration of modern professional baseball. We must preserve and honor Jackie Robinson’s legacy and the impact he had in Daytona Beach and across America. That is why I am proud to introduce this bill in Congress on Jackie Robinson Day with fellow Floridian Senator Rubio to protect and commemorate the Jackie Robinson Ballpark in Daytona Beach so it may live on for generations to come.” “I am thrilled to introduce this bill, honoring Jackie Robinson's legacy by designating the Daytona Beach ballpark as a National Commemorative Site. It's a vital step towards preserving his historic contributions,” said Soto. “Jackie Robinson's legacy is a beacon of courage, resilience, and equality. His groundbreaking journey through adversity not only transformed the game of baseball but ignited a movement for social change that continues to inspire generations worldwide.""
 “Jackie Robinson wasn’t just a phenomenal baseball player; he was a trailblazer who broke barriers both on and off the field,"" said Senator Rubio. ""In 1946, he played at the Daytona City Island Ballpark, where his courage transformed not only the sport, but also our nation. I’m introducing the Jackie Robinson Ballpark Commemorative Site Act to honor and protect the site where Jackie played his first game and to remind us of the strength and impact one person can have on the world.” “Jackie Robinson’s journey in professional baseball, where he became an American icon, started in Daytona in the ballpark which now bears his name, and it is appropriate that this location be recognized in this manner,” said Greg Rosenbaum, Chairman of Minor League Baseball’s Government Relations Committee. “Minor League Baseball is proud to have one of our most historic ballparks designated as a National Commemorative Site, and we appreciate the bipartisan support that made this piece of legislation possible.”  “We are extremely honored to be entrusted with further stewarding the legacy of Jackie Robinson in Daytona Beach,” said Bob Fregolle, Co-owner & Operating Partner of the Daytona Tortugas. “This designation is greatly appreciated by the community here and will only strengthen his legacy for generations to come.” 244 Cannon House Office Building

167,April 15,Chellie Pingree,D,Me.-1,"Pingree, Durbin Send Letter to VA Requesting Details on Produce Prescription Programs","U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Congresswoman Chellie Pingree (D-Maine) today sent a letter to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs Denis McDonough requesting information about the implementation of “produce prescription” initiatives at the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). In 2022, President Biden called on VHA to begin the implementation of “produce prescriptions,” which allow patients who have diet-related chronic health conditions to be “prescribed” vouchers to purchase free or discounted fruits and vegetables. While the program is being piloted at VHA facilities in Houston and Salt Lake City, Congress needs more information about the program in order to understand how to best support the health and well-being of veterans across the United States, and potentially expand the program to more patients.  In their letter, the lawmakers requested an update on the produce prescription programming, noting that veterans have higher rates of illness as compared to other Americans. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 19 percent of veterans have diabetes and 12 percent of veterans have heart disease compared to 16 percent and 12 percent of all Americans, respectively. “We are writing to request an update on the Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) efforts to implement ‘produce prescription’ initiatives within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA),” the lawmakers wrote.  “Veterans often suffer from higher rates of illness compared to the general population, in part because of the stress and trauma that veterans too often have experienced,” the lawmakers wrote. “VA research has found that there is a need for dietary interventions for the health management of veterans with chronic conditions. At the same time, veterans are at a higher risk for food insecurity than the general population, but are less likely to be enrolled in SNAP benefits. As such, it is essential to ensure that veterans have the support needed to address their chronic health conditions, including strategies to address access to healthy, affordable food.” The lawmakers noted that Congress approved $2 million in federal funding for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to implement prescription produce initiatives within VHA.   In closing their letter, the lawmakers asked for additional information about how VHA has utilized the $2 million that Congress appropriated and about how it plans to scale the current produce prescription initiatives using the funds that Congress appropriated to serve more veterans across the nation.  “There are now two ‘produce prescription’ initiatives at VHA facilities in Houston, Texas, and Salt Lake City, Utah. Does VA plan to expand ‘produce prescriptions’ initiatives to other VHA facilities across the United States?” the lawmakers asked in their letter.  “Please explain in detail the resources, funding, or legislative authorities that the VA would require to expand ‘produce prescription’ initiatives to other VHA facilities across the United States, including any barriers to doing so,” the lawmakers requested as they concluded the letter.  Low fruit and vegetable consumption contributes to the fact that more than 50 percent of Americans have a diet-related chronic condition, such as heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. Veterans experience disproportionately higher rates of chronic disease compared to non-veterans, and 24 percent of veterans report being food insecure, which harms the ability to control their chronic diseases.   Initiatives that support veterans in obtaining fresh produce can improve health outcomes. According to the American Heart Association (AHA), adults who participate in produce prescription programs consume 30 percent more fruits and vegetables a day. In this research, AHA found that all participants in produce prescription programs experienced a measurable decrease in blood pressure and blood sugar.  A copy of the letter is available here and below. Pingree is a longtime organic farmer and serves on both the House Agriculture Committee, House Appropriations Subcommittees on Agriculture; Military Construction and Veterans Affairs; and Interior and Environment. She cofounded the bipartisan Food is Medicine Working Group.  +++ Dear Secretary McDonough,  We are writing to request an update on the Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) efforts to implement “produce prescription” initiatives within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).   Nearly 60 percent of Americans have a diet-related chronic health condition, such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes.  These conditions claim the lives of more than half a million Americans on an annual basis.  In addition, these conditions take a significant economic toll.  Diabetes alone accounts for $327 billion in annual health care expenditures in the United States.  Veterans often suffer from higher rates of illness compared to the general population, in part because of the stress and trauma that veterans too often have experienced. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 70 percent of veterans are obese compared to 60 percent of all Americans, 19 percent of veterans have diabetes compared to 16 percent of all Americans, and 12 percent of veterans have heart disease compared to seven percent of all Americans.  VA research has found that there is a need for dietary interventions for the health management of veterans with chronic conditions.  At the same time, veterans are at a higher risk for food insecurity than the general population, but are less likely to be enrolled in SNAP benefits.  As such, it is essential to ensure that veterans have the support needed to address their chronic health conditions, including strategies to address access to healthy, affordable food. As part of the White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health, President Biden called for “prescription produce” initiatives to be implemented within the VHA.  Congress provided $2 million for the VA to do through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 (P.L. 117-328).  We appreciate that the VHA has worked with the Rockefeller Foundation to establish two “produce prescription” initiatives within VHA facilities in Houston, Texas, and Salt Lake City, Utah.  However, we want to understand how the VHA plans to scale such “produce prescription” initiatives across the United States to reach the millions of other veterans who could benefit from these initiatives.  We support the VA’s work to improve the health and well-being of veterans and believe that “produce prescription” initiatives may have the potential to support veterans while reducing health care expenditures through the VHA.  To help us better understand how Congress can support these efforts, we request that you respond to the following questions by May 13, 2024. As part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023(P.L. 117-328), Congress provided $2 million for VA “to provide guidance and resources for VA facilities to develop local [produce prescription] program and pursue strategies for patient education and outreach.”  On April 25, 2023, VA announced that it would partner with the Rockefeller Foundation to expand access to “produce prescription” initiatives within the VHA.  How has the VA used the $2 million appropriated by Congress in FY23?

If the VA has not used the $2 million for this MOU with the Rockefeller Foundation, how has the VA used these funds?

If the VA has not used the $2 million for this MOU with the Rockefeller Foundation, with what funds, if any, did the VA use for this initiative?

There are now two “produce prescription” initiatives at VHA facilities in Houston, Texas, and Salt Lake City, Utah.  Does VA plan to expand “produce prescriptions” initiatives to other VHA facilities across the United States using the funds that Congress appropriated?  

If so, when?

If not, why?

Please explain in detail the resources, funding, or legislative authorities that the VA would require to expand “produce prescription” initiatives to other VHA facilities across the United States using the funds that Congress appropriated, including any barriers to doing so.

We understand that the VA’s financial policies state that the VHA can purchase food or refreshments when part of “the provision of medical treatment to VA beneficiaries under 38 U.S.C. § 7301(b), e.g.,in-patient meals.”  Please explain in detail the VA’s interpretation of this rule as it relates to “produce prescriptions,” including whether or not it must be amended in order to expand “produce prescriptions” to reach other veterans across the United States.

Sincerely,

###

170,April 15,Pramila Jayapal,D,Wash.-7,Jayapal Statement Recognizing One Year of War in Sudan,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Representative Pramila Jayapal (WA-07) released the following statement marking one year since the start of war in Sudan: “The people of Sudan have been suffering for far too long. For decades, brutal military dictatorships have denied the Sudanese people their basic human rights. And since the onset of the current conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) more than 12,000 people have been killed, 6 million have been internally displaced, 1.5 million have fled the country as refugees, and human rights groups have documented extremely high rates of sexual violence against women and girls in the region. Estimates also forecast that as many as 250,000 children and pregnant women could die of malnutrition in the coming months and only 30 percent of hospitals in Sudan are functioning. “In 2019, the Sudanese people inspired the entire world when they rose up and demanded an end to the dictatorship of President Omar al Bashir and a transition to democracy. In 2020, I had the opportunity to visit Sudan as part of a Congressional Delegation to meet with the new President in a celebratory moment. I met many of the leaders of the peaceful nonviolent movement, and seeing their courage and resilience continued to give me hope. It breaks my heart to see the country plunged back into chaos and widespread suffering. Too many of the Sudanese people have been displaced from their homes, and face not only the violence and cruelty of war, but also critical shortages of food, water, medicine, and electricity. “I have been in close touch with the U.S. Special Envoy for Sudan, Tom Perriello, and I appreciate his hard work towards a resolution to this horrific conflict. I urge the White House to utilize every tool in its toolbox — including sanctions for those involved in furthering this violence — to push for successful peace talks that implement the Sudanese people’s vision of civilian democracy and towards funding immediate humanitarian assistance from all our global partners. I am also working hard to ensure that all Americans understand the human consequences of what is happening in Sudan and become engaged in protecting innocent Sudanese civilians. We cannot turn a blind eye to the loss of life and suffering of the Sudanese people and their clear desire for a constitutional transition.” More than 1,800 people with Sudanese roots live in Washington State, greatly affecting many in Jayapal’s district. Below are some of their personal notes on the violence occurring in Sudan: “The war in Sudan has endured for one year too long, inflicting immense suffering upon the country and its people.  The impact of the war is very personal to me. My family has been displaced and they had to seek safety and refuge in other countries. It is devastating for my parents to leave their family, their home and everything they worked for all their life. More than 25 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance. This is by far the world’s largest displacement crisis and no one is paying attention,” said Mubarak Elamin, Washington State Sudanese Community Leader. “The war in Sudan is something that I never fathomed would occur, at least not to the extent that it has become. Like many others,  my family has been displaced, many of them who are elders, and are required to start over again. All that I have now are my childhood memories of summer vacations in Khartoum, in Burri and I’m still in shock that going back isn’t an option,” said Duha Mohamed, Washington State Sudanese Community Leader. “The war has inflicted trauma upon millions of people across Sudan. Many have depleted through the little savings that they had and are unable to find work due to the war. Those in the diaspora are now emotionally and financially stressed from having to care of their relatives in Sudan while worrying about their safety,” said Ahmed Salih, Graduate Student, University of Washington. “Beyond the headlines are very real stories that for those who are removed from the situation may forget, especially in a time where it seems like death and calamities have become all too regular. However, for people like me, they aren’t just headlines but have very real impacts on our very being. The recent massacres in various towns in El Gezira by the RSF have left many in my own family dead. While I am geographically far from the situation, my heart is still painfully affected by the senseless violence inflicted upon relatives and family friends,” Mo Ibrahim, MBA Student, Seattle University.

171,April 15,Pramila Jayapal,D,Wash.-7,Jayapal Urging Accountability Following Reports of Mistreatment of Detained Persons at Immigration Detention Facilities,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Representative Pramila Jayapal (WA-07), Ranking Member of the Immigration Integrity, Security, and Enforcement Subcommittee, is leading 47 Members of Congress in calling on Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to provide answers on the troubling treatment of individuals held in immigration detention facilities. Recent reports have detailed serious problems related to the performance of unnecessary medical procedures and the misuse of solitary confinement. “We have a responsibility to treat all human beings with dignity and fairness,” wrote the Members. “All facilities operated by or in connection with the United States government, funded by taxpayers should reflect that. These recent reports indicate that we are falling far short of our obligations. We urge the administration to take these reports and their recommendations seriously.” The United Nations has determined that solitary confinement lasting over 15 days constitutes torture. However, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and its subcontractors regularly detain individuals in solitary confinement for longer periods. Reporting shows that between 2018-2023, more than 14,000 individuals were held in solitary confinement for an average of 27 days, 682 for at least three months, and 42 for over a year.  In addition to extensive stints of solitary confinement, which has been proven to result in long-lasting physical and mental harm, the DHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) has also published reports indicating serious concerns with medical procedures at immigration detention facilities. According to DHS OIG, between 2019 and 2021, at least 25 percent of surgeries performed at facilities run by ICE and its subcontractors were not properly approved, therefore ICE cannot confirm whether they were even medically necessary. Specifically, the Members are calling on DHS to provide answers to how they will ensure ongoing compliance with stated policies in all immigration detention facilities, to share the status of implementation for recommendations to phase out the use of solitary confinement, and to share whether ICE plans to advise the President of recommendations for reform. Jayapal has been an active leader on the issue of increasing accountability at immigration detention centers and phasing out the use of solitary confinement. She recently led 50 Members in calling for increased transparency over detention centers that had been recommended for closure, has called for accountability in the death of a detained person at the Northwest Detention Center who died after 1,418 total days of solitary confinement, and was a leader in ensuring accountability for more than a dozen immigrant women who underwent forced, unnecessary medical procedures at the now-closed Irwin Country Detention Center. She also leads the Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act, which would work to reduce our overreliance on detention, end the use of detention for profit, end inhumane conditions at detention centers, and protect the civil and human rights of immigrants.

172,April 12,Paul Gosar,R,Ariz.-9,Congressman Gosar Votes Against Warrantless Spy Bill Reauthorization," Washington, D.C. -- Congressman Paul A. Gosar, D.D.S. (AZ-09), issued the following statement after voting against H.R. 7888, the Reforming Intelligence and Securing America Act, legislation to reauthorize Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, for two years. “Congress purportedly wrote Section 702 of FISA to protect our national security by allowing the intelligence community, including the FBI, to spy on non-American threats without a court order.  However, FISA was never intended to spy on U.S. citizens.    Unfortunately, since its inception, the FBI and the federal intelligence community have abused FISA by collecting the communications of American citizens without a warrant, raising serious concerns about the indiscriminate and broad nature of the surveillance program and further infringing on the rights of Americans.   For example, the FBI has abused Section 702 to conduct warrantless searches against American citizens more than 278,000 times.  Several good amendments were offered to improve and reform FISA, including a commonsense amendment offered by my friend, Representative Biggs, that would have prevented warrantless searches of Americans.  Sadly, 86 Republicans and 126 Democrats inexcusably voted to allow the deep state to continue spying on Americans without a warrant by voting down this amendment.   As a result, I could not support the warrantless surveillance of Americans allowed under section 702 of FISA and voted against its reauthorization. It is a clear overreach of authority and is a direct violation of the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures.  While everything must be done to prevent future terrorist activities, it should not come at the cost of the privacy and civil rights abuses of innocent American citizens,” concluded Congressman Gosar.   ###",Freedom Party,"['washington congressman paul gosar', 'issued following statement voting', 'reforming intelligence securing america act legislation reauthorize section foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa two year', 'congress purportedly wrote section fisa protect national security allowing intelligence community including fbi spy threat without court order', 'however fisa never intended spy citizen', 'unfortunately since inception fbi federal intelligence community abused fisa collecting communication american citizen without warrant raising serious concern indiscriminate broad nature surveillance program infringing right american', 'example fbi abused section conduct warrantless search american citizen time', 'several good amendment offered improve reform fisa including commonsense amendment offered friend representative biggs would prevented warrantless search american', 'sadly republican democrat inexcusably voted allow deep state continue spying american without warrant voting amendment', 'result could support warrantless surveillance american allowed section fisa voted reauthorization', 'clear overreach authority direct violation fourth amendment constitution protects unreasonable search seizure', 'everything must done prevent future terrorist activity come cost privacy civil right abuse innocent american citizen concluded congressman gosar', '']",washington congressman paul gosar issued following statement voting reforming intelligence securing america act legislation reauthorize section foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa two year congress purportedly wrote section fisa protect national security allowing intelligence community including fbi spy threat without court order however fisa never intended spy citizen unfortunately since inception fbi federal intelligence community abused fisa collecting communication american citizen without warrant raising serious concern indiscriminate broad nature surveillance program infringing right american example fbi abused section conduct warrantless search american citizen time several good amendment offered improve reform fisa including commonsense amendment offered friend representative biggs would prevented warrantless search american sadly republican democrat inexcusably voted allow deep state continue spying american without warrant voting amendment result could support warrantless surveillance american allowed section fisa voted reauthorization clear overreach authority direct violation fourth amendment constitution protects unreasonable search seizure everything must done prevent future terrorist activity come cost privacy civil right abuse innocent american citizen concluded congressman gosar
173,April 9,David Trone,D,Md.-6,Appropriator Rep. David Trone Delivers Remarks at Press Conference Following Delegation Meeting on the Francis Scott Key Bridge,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE April 9, 2024 Appropriator Rep. David Trone Delivers Remarks at Press Conference Following Delegation Meeting on the Francis Scott Key Bridge Congressman David Trone (D-MD), a member of the House Appropriations Committee, delivered the following remarks at the press conference after a meeting with Maryland’s federal delegation, Department of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Governor Wes Moore, and more officials on the Francis Scott Key Bridge. On Friday, he affirmed (via statement) President Biden’s promise for the federal government to pay for 100% of the project and called on his Congressional colleagues to support. Congressman David Trone delivers remarks on April 9, 2024. Video here. “First of all, what’s most important to think about, again, as was mentioned, the six souls that lost their lives… [from] Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador… these are immigrants that are so often vilified throughout our country now.  “Yet, they’re often the greatest Americans, Americans who work the toughest jobs and the toughest hours of the day, with very little respect and compensation. So, we need to continue to honor them and realize their importance to our society. I want to also thank Governor Moore: his leadership on the ground, being there every day. He has been the quarterback. He’s been the go-to guy to get this partnership with the federal government executed. So he has just been a rock star in this effort.  “But at the same time, as I mentioned, as an appropriator, a bipartisan appropriator working with Congressman Harris, future appropriations chair Tom Cole. We’ve got to bring these dollars home in a positive way. But at the same time, the devil is in the details. And we’ve got to make sure we execute on President Biden’s promises. His promise to make sure that union labor builds this bridge. We need these projects to have Project Labor Agreements, so our union brothers and sisters can build the bridge the right way and on time. And we got to keep thinking about those that have lost wages: our longshoremen, our small businessmen, in the Port of Baltimore, 2.2 million dollars a day in lost wages. Guess what? Four hundred and thirty dollars a week unemployment ain’t going to cover it.  “The special fund by the state, [makes it] maybe six hundred hundred dollars a week. That’s not going to cover it. They still got mortgages to meet, food to put on the table, so we need an all of government effort not to just let that slip through the cracks and say, ‘oh, the Port’s open now again. It’s June 1, too bad.’ The government, the President made a commitment to all those there to make up on those lost wages, and we’ve got to come through on that, and that’s what this team will do. So thank you.”  Are you, or someone you know, struggling with a mental health or substance use disorder? You are not alone. Over the course of a year, we recently lost 100,000 sons, daughters, moms, and dads to drug overdoses. Millions are suffering from mental illness, exacerbated by the pandemic.

174,April 9,Rick Larsen,D,Wash.-2,Larsen Applauds House Passage of Bipartisan Migratory Bird Protection Bill,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Rep. Rick Larsen (WA-02) applauded House passage of the Migratory Birds of the Americas Conservation Enhancements Act, a bipartisan bill introduced by Reps. Larsen, Maria Elvira Salazar (FL-27), David Joyce (OH-14) and Mary Peltola (AK-At Large) to reauthorize and improve the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act (NMBCA), the only federal grant initiative to promote the conservation of migratory birds. The bill passed the House of Representatives by voice vote. Senators Ben Cardin (D-MD) and John Boozman (R-AR) have introduced similar legislation, which the Senate is expected to consider soon. For video of Larsen’s remarks on the House floor in support of the bill, click here. What Larsen and Stakeholders Are Saying “I am glad to see our migratory bird bill soar through the House! Pesticide pollution, deforestation and invasive species threaten the more than 350 migratory bird species that rely on the Pacific Northwest as their flyaway,"" said Larsen, the lead Democrat on the Transportation & Infrastructure Committee. ""This bipartisan bill will help protect these diverse bird populations and their habitats in the Pacific Northwest and across the Western Hemisphere and provide a significant boost to the outdoor economy.” “We have lost three billion birds since 1970—a staggering number—and this legislation is critically important to help communities and partners meet the challenges of the moment so we can conserve migratory birds for years to come,” said Marshall Johnson, chief conservation officer at the National Audubon Society. “96 million Americans engage in birdwatching, contributing $100 billion to the U.S. economy each year. Investing in migratory bird conservation across the hemisphere is essential to reversing these troubling bird declines. We thank the House and the co-sponsors of this bill for their leadership, and urge swift passage of the companion bill in the Senate.” ""North Cascades Audubon Society wholeheartedly thanks Rep. Rick Larsen for his leadership and efforts to reauthorize and enhance the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act,” said Robert Kaye, conservation chair at the North Cascades Audubon Society. “This crucial legislation will help protect the neotropical migratory birds that perform such an essential role in the health and well-being of the ecological systems as they journey throughout our hemisphere. Additionally, so much of our forests, lakes, streams, wetlands and marine habitats that are essential to the health of our local ecosystems, and to the survival of these transient birds, will greatly benefit from the protections incorporated into this essential reauthorization legislation."" “As members of the Skagit Valley community, we understand the vital role that migratory birds play in our ecosystem and our economy,” said John Day, president of the Skagit Audubon Society. “Our valley is home to myriad migratory bird species that rely on the region's wetlands, forests, and farmland as critical stopover and nesting sites during their long journeys. Skagit Audubon Society greatly appreciates the leadership of Rep. Rick Larsen for passing this legislation to increase investments in protecting birds across the hemisphere, helping to ensure that birds have the habitat they need to thrive, no matter where they are on their migratory journey.” What the Migratory Bird Bill Does Since 2002, the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act has awarded more than $89 million in grants to over 700 migratory bird conservation projects in the United States, Canada, Central and South America, and the Caribbean. Partner organizations have contributed an additional $346 million to these projects, which have protected more than 5 million acres of habitat in the Western Hemisphere.

175,April 10,Abigail Spanberger,D,Va.-7,ICYMI: Spanberger Joins Prince William County Leaders to Celebrate More Than $2.5 Million in Community-Requested Investment Secured for Minnieville Road-Prince William Parkway Interchange Project,"The Congresswoman Worked Directly with Prince William County Officials to Help Construct a New Interchange to Alleviate Traffic Congestion & Improve Safety at Minnieville Road-Prince William Parkway Intersection **CLICK HERE for Photos of Spanberger & County Officials at Event** PRINCE WILLIAM COUNTY, Va. — U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger yesterday joined Prince William County officials and community leaders to celebrate the federal funding successfully secured for local projects as part of a U.S. House and U.S. Senate-passed fiscal year (FY)2024 appropriations bill. The major investment in this community-requested project totals $2.5 million that was signed into law and is now headed to the county. Spanberger worked directly with Prince William County leaders to solicit this request, move this project forward, and ensure it was included in the final package. This investment will help the county construct an interchange and additional improvements at the intersection of Minnieville Road and Prince William Parkway. “The Minnieville Road-Prince William Parkway Interchange Project will relieve some of the congestion that Northern Virginians are all too familiar with and help keep Virginians safe on the road. This $2.5 million federal investment in Prince William County will strengthen the county, invest in our local economy, and support local jobs,” said Spanberger. “With this funding, we are helping to meet the growing demands of this community and putting the pieces together to support this region’s continued growth and economic development — and I have been proud to work directly with county officials and community leaders to secure these federal dollars to help move this project across the finish line.” U.S. Senators Tim Kaine (D-VA) and Mark Warner (D-VA) also worked during the FY2024 appropriations process to make sure this funding for Prince William County was secured in the U.S. Senate-passed package and sent to the President’s desk to be signed into law. “I’m proud to have worked with local leaders in Prince William County and my colleagues in Congress to secure this $2.5 million to invest in roadway improvements, sidewalks, and updated trails,” said Kaine. “Supporting new, improved infrastructure is vital to keeping the people of Virginia safe and connecting our communities to work, school, and essential services.” “I was proud to vote to pass the FY24 government funding legislation and am thrilled to see $2.5 million in dedicated funding go towards making the intersection of Minnieville Road and Prince William Parkway safer and more accessible. I look forward to continuing to champion local projects that ensure folks can get where they need to go quickly and efficiently,” said Warner. Spanberger, Kaine, and Warner secured $2,500,000 for Prince William County to help construct a Single Point Urban Interchange (SPUI) at the intersection of Minnieville Road and Prince William Parkway. The project will help relieve congestion, improve safety, enhance access and connectivity, and support economic development plans in the region. This funding will also provide for the construction of sidewalk and trail segments to improve safety and increase access for pedestrians and bicyclists. BACKGROUND For FY2024, the U.S. House of Representatives allowed for specific Community Project Funding requests — as it did in FY2023. Spanberger worked directly with community leaders in localities across Virginia’s Seventh District to gather community-focused requests for her submissions. Click here for the full list of her submissions. The Community Project Funding process was created to ensure that Members of Congress — in concert with the communities they represent — may submit direct applications for federal funding to support locally planned projects as part of the yearly appropriations process. To be eligible, projects must be sponsored by local or state government entities or non-profit organizations and must be projects that would otherwise meet the qualifications to apply for federal grant funding. The purpose of Community Project Funding is to ensure direct, local engagement as part of the federal appropriations process. In line with this goal, funding applications needed to demonstrate significant local support for the projects. ### Congresswoman: “We Have Too Much Work to Do to Waste Time on Petty Political Games” WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger today released the following statement after voting against U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene’s (R-GA-14) effort to throw the U.S. House of Representatives into chaos. “Since January 2023, this dysfunctional House Republican majority has […] The Common Ground Scorecard Ranked the Congresswoman as Tied for Fourth Place for Most Bipartisan Elected Official in the Country WASHINGTON, D.C. — The nonpartisan Common Ground Committee (CGC) once again ranked U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger as the most bipartisan Member of Congress from Virginia — and gave her the fourth-highest score of any lawmakers in […] Since the Start of 2019, the Congresswoman’s Office Has Returned More Than $38 Million in Backlogged IRS Refunds, Social Security Checks, VA Benefits, & More WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger announced today that her office has now returned more than $38 million in federal casework funds to residents of Virginia’s Seventh District.

176,April 10,Abigail Spanberger,D,Va.-7,"Following Spanberger Push, Stafford County Awarded More Than $10 Million for Brooke Road Flood Mitigation & Resiliency Project","This Federal Award Will Allow Stafford County to Help Alleviate Significant Flooding that Routinely Occurs Along Brooke Road, Improve Access for Residents & Emergency Services WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger today announced that — after her office sent a letter of support — Stafford County has received a $10,251,613 federal grant to raise and realign a portion of Brooke Road to alleviate frequent flooding that occurs along the road. This funding is made possible through the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) and Federal Highway Administration’s Promoting Resilient Operations for Transformative, Efficient, and Cost-Saving Transportation (PROTECT) Grant Program — created by the bipartisan infrastructure law, which Spanberger helped negotiate and voted to pass. This award will allow Stafford County to realign a 0.45-mile portion of Brooke Road from Loblolly Lane to Maplewood Drive to relocate the road out of the floodplain. The project will address frequent flooding on portions of the road that become impassable for extended periods of time during heavy rainstorms, isolating more than 600 residents and restricting access to food, water, shelter, places of work, and emergency services. The roadway runs parallel to Accokeek Creek, a major tributary to the Potomac River. “Virginians deserve safe roads to drive on in their communities. The project to be funded by this more than $10 million federal grant will finally help relieve persistent flooding that keeps residents of Stafford County and those traveling through from getting where they need to go, getting what they need, and getting the emergency services they might depend on,” said Spanberger. “The bipartisan infrastructure law is continuing to deliver for Virginia’s communities — and I was proud to have a hand in crafting the bipartisan framework that led to this historic investment in our nation’s physical infrastructure needs.” “Stafford County is grateful to the Federal Highway Administration and Department of Transportation for the opportunity to be awarded the $10.2 million PROTECT Grant,” said Meg Bohmke, Chairwoman, Stafford County Board of Supervisors. “Once obtained, it will play a crucial role in addressing the persistent flooding issues at the ‘S’ curve on Brooke Road. It will also enable the County to implement a sustainable solution, ensuring the safety and accessibility of the residents living beyond that point.” BACKGROUND According to USDOT, the Promoting Resilient Operations for Transformative, Efficient, and Cost-Saving Transportation (PROTECT) Discretionary Grant Program was created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act — also known as the bipartisan infrastructure law— to provide funding to ensure surface transportation resilience to natural hazards including climate change, sea level rise, flooding, extreme weather events, and other natural disasters through support of planning activities, resilience improvements, community resilience and evacuation routes, and at-risk coastal infrastructure.

This funding is made possible through the Regional Alliances and Multistakeholder Partnerships to Stimulate (RAMPS) Cybersecurity Education and Workforce Development Program at the U.S. Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). This nearly $190,000 award will allow the Quantico Cyber Hub to partner with community organizations to address the region’s existing STEM workforce gap and invest in cutting-edge research. The Cyber Bytes Foundation will use this funding to focus on diversifying the cybersecurity workforce — including increasing opportunities for women, Veterans, residents of rural communities, and other underrepresented groups — and stimulating workforce development and cybersecurity education through outreach efforts, technical training, and certification courses. Quantico Cyber Hub members include technology industry leaders, higher-education institutions, K-12 school districts, government agencies, and workforce development organizations committed to leveraging innovation and excellence in cybersecurity’s key technology focus areas. “Our national security and our nation’s future depend on a strong, skilled workforce that is well-equipped to address increasingly complex cyber threats,” said Spanberger. “My team and I recognized this funding’s ability to develop these career pathways for Virginians, and I’m proud that we were able to have a hand in bringing this funding home for the Cyber Bytes Foundation and addressing local workforce needs. Investments in our region’s cybersecurity workforce will connect Virginians with training to advance their careers in this field and help our Commonwealth remain a digital leader into the future.” “We (Cyber Bytes Foundation) are honored and excited to be selected as 1 of 18 total nationwide recipients of the NIST RAMPS award.

178,April 8,Pete Aguilar,D,Calif.-33,"Rep. Aguilar, Secretary Becerra Highlight Biden-Harris Administration Efforts to Advance Health Equity in Inland Empire","On Friday, April 5,Rep. Pete Aguilar and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra visited SAC Health – San Bernardino to highlight the investments made by Congress and the Biden-Harris Administration to make health care more affordable and equitable in the Inland Empire. Rep. Aguilar hosted a fireside chat with Secretary Becerra and CEO of SAC Health, Jason Lohr, to discuss the importance of federal funding in supporting better health outcomes for Latino residents in the region, followed by a press event celebrating the success of the Inflation Reduction Act in bringing down prescription drug costs. “It was a pleasure having Secretary Becerra in the Inland Empire to highlight the shared commitment of the Biden Administration and House Democrats to make health care more affordable for folks in our region,” said Rep. Pete Aguilar. “While we celebrate these victories, we must also acknowledge the challenges that lie ahead. Far too many hardworking residents pay too much for prescription drugs and access to basic medical care. I am committed to continue pushing to lower costs and improve health care access in the Inland Empire.” “Here in San Bernadino, and across the country, accessible, high-quality health care is being recognized as a right for all, and not just a privilege for the wealthy. Finally, more families than ever in California have the peace of mind that comes from knowing they have coverage,” said Xavier Becerra, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. “We are grateful for Congressman Aguilar’s ongoing commitment to support SAC Health and our ability to provide care to the community,” said Jason Lohr, CEO of SAC Health. “For over a decade, he has been a champion in helping secure over 85 million dollars of HHS grant funds that have supported SAC Health programs such as our medical mobile clinic, residency training through our Teaching Health Center funding, HIV care, and Medication Assisted Treatment clinic grants. As we actively expand our locations, access, and services, we look forward to his continued support that will allow us to provide quality healthcare to those who need it the most.” In 2022, Rep. Aguilar helped pass the Inflation Reduction Act, which capped the cost of insulin at $35/month for Medicare enrollees and lowered insurance premiums for those enrolled through the Affordable Care Act. Last year, Rep. Aguilar also helped deliver over $3 million in federal funding from HHS to SAC Health to support their operations and increase access to affordable care in the region. Additionally, in 2022, Rep. Aguilar secured $375,000 to help expand SAC Health’s Mobile Health Clinic program, which officially opened last year.

179,April 10,Paul Tonko,D,N.Y.-20,Tonko Introduces Cultural Resources Challenge Act,"WASHINGTON, DC—Congressman Paul D. Tonko (NY-20) today introduced his Cultural Resources Challenge Act, new legislation that would support and protect the nation’s cultural resources by empowering the National Park Service (NPS) to expand historic preservation efforts. Tonko’s legislation comes days after the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) released their Cultural Resources Challenge for the National Parks Service report, which called upon Congress to better support and fund NPS to restore and protect the nation’s resources. “Our national parks are powerful, awe-inspiring records of our rich heritage and history,” Congressman Tonko said. “Despite their vital historic and economic benefits, our cultural resources are continuously underfunded and facing dire threats through natural disasters and climate change. My Cultural Resources Challenge Act seeks to address these threats. By addressing staff shortages with the National Park Service, confronting the role of climate change, and improving resiliency and accessibility of cultural resources, my bill will help ensure our cultural resources can continue to connect individuals and communities with the stories of our shared past and inspire future generations.” “History is at the heart of our national parks, which protect pivotal stories of the Revolutionary War, the Civil Rights Movement, and countless other chapters of the ever-unfolding American narrative. National Park Service rangers work tirelessly to teach park visitors about our country’s diverse, complex cultural resources.” said Alan Spears, Senior Director of Cultural Resources for the National Parks Conservation Association. “But chronic underfunding means fewer talented National Park Service historians and other expert staff are left to tell those stories at parks every year. Funding shortfalls have left our history vulnerable to climate change-related disaster, with flood and fire threatening historic buildings, battlefields, and more. The National Parks Conservation Association proudly supports Congressman Tonko’s Cultural Resources Challenge Act, which would breathe new life into cultural resources management and preservation in our national parks. New funding would help the Park Service recruit more of the best and brightest cultural resources staff, as well as safeguard American history from climate change. This bill would help equip the Park Service to continue to serve as some of America’s greatest storytellers, and protect our American legacy for generations to come.” “This legislation recognizes the vital importance of safeguarding our shared cultural heritage in U.S. National Parks from the growing threat of accelerating climate change impacts, including coastal flooding, extreme heat and worsening wildfires. The Act would also strengthen the National Park Service’s ability to implement effective science-based strategies to ensure the parks’ irreplaceable cultural resources are more resilient to climate harms by involving local communities and integrating Indigenous Knowledge, expertise and oral history,” said Adam Markham, Deputy Director for Climate, Union of Concerned Scientists. Tonko has long been a champion in protecting and preserving America’s historic cultural sites and the stories they hold. He authored the National Heritage Areas Act, which became law in 2022 and established clear, transparent standards that make it easier for communities and local partnerships to develop and maintain their Heritage Areas.

180,April 10,Brad Finstad,R,Minn.-1,Finstad Introduces Legislation to Protect Farm Country from Burdensome EPA Regulations,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Congressman Brad Finstad (MN-01) introduced the EPA Accountability to Farm Country Act, legislation that would require the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and farmer stakeholders to review rules and regulations proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that may impact the agricultural sector and provide recommendations on how to limit the impact. If EPA does not mitigate the effect of their proposed rule, it would be unable to be finalized. “American farmers are the best environmentalists in the world, and the EPA’s repeated failure to consider the impact of their regulatory agenda on agriculture has made clear that they are out-of-touch with farm country,” said Rep. Finstad. “Those who are directly impacted by EPA regulations – American farm families who work tirelessly to feed and fuel the world – deserve a seat at the table.” The EPA Accountability to Farm Country Act is endorsed by the American Farm Bureau Federation, National Corn Growers Association, National Pork Producers Council, Meat Institute, Agricultural Retailers Association, U.S. Beet Sugar Association, American Sugarbeet Growers Association, North American Blueberry Council, Minnesota Corn Growers Association, Minnesota Soybean Growers Association, and Minnesota Farm Bureau. “All too often, growers are left out of federal rulemaking efforts, even though those rules have major implications for farm families, agriculture, and rural communities. It is critical that farmers have a say in crafting rules and regulations that affect them, and Minnesota Corn Growers Association appreciates Congressman Finstad’s work to ensure that farmers are given that opportunity. Bills like the EPA Accountability to Farm Country Act sponsored by Congressman Finstad assure that farmers have a seat at the table so regulatory agencies fully understand the impact of their rules. Congressman Finstad has a long history of supporting farmers, and we are proud to endorse the EPA Accountability to Farm Country Act.” – Dana Allen-Tully, President, Minnesota Corn Growers Association “Farmers rely on a variety of products to maintain sustainable farming enterprises, and many of those products are approved and reviewed by the EPA. Agriculture needs a voice during these important conversations, and the Minnesota Farm Bureau applauds Congressman Finstad's leadership on this issue.”  – Dan Glessing, President of Minnesota Farm Bureau  Specifically, the EPA Accountability to Farm Country Act: Original cosponsors of the EPA Accountability to Farm Country Act include Representatives Dusty Johnson (R-SD-AL), Don Bacon (R-NE-02), Ashley Hinson (R-IA-02), Scott Franklin (R-FL-18), Derrick Van Orden (R-WI-03), Dan Newhouse (R-WA-04), Michelle Fischbach (R-MN-07), Austin Scott (R-GA-08), Roger Williams (R-TX-25), Mike Flood (R-NE-01), and Barry Moore (R-AL-02).

181,April 10,Jamaal Bowman,D,N.Y.-16,Rep. Jamaal Bowman Introduces the ACCESS In Mental Health Act to Strengthen Mental Health Workforce,"For Immediate Release WASHINGTON, DC – Today, Congressman Jamaal Bowman, Ed.D. (NY-16), along with 16 of his colleagues, introduced the  ACCESS In Mental Health Act.  To address the systemic issues in our nation’s mental health system, Congressman Bowman (NY-16) introduced the Advancing Culturally Competent and Equitable Supportive Services (ACCESS) in Mental Health Act. This bill would: Provide grants to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) including Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) to create, expand, or improve graduate programs in mental health fields. These fields include psychology, counseling, social work, psychiatry, school-based mental health professions, substance use disorder prevention and treatment, and more.  Provide grants of $10,000 per year to students pursuing graduate degrees in mental health fields at HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs to help cover the cost of attendance. “As an educator for 20 years, I saw firsthand how the lack of mental health professionals and culturally responsive care impacted my students and their families,” said Congressman Jamaal Bowman, Ed.D. (NY-16). “Not only do we need more mental health professionals in our communities and schools, but we need more Black and Brown mental health professionals who are equipped to provide culturally responsive and trauma-informed care. My ACCESS in Mental Health Act would work to rectify the lack of diversity in the mental health workforce by providing grants to HBCUs, TCUs, HSIs, MSIs, and their students, to create and expand programs and to support tuition costs. We’ve been facing a national mental health crisis over the last few years and Congress must begin to take action by strengthening our mental health workforce and investing in opportunities for young people from all communities to enter mental health fields.”   “As our country faces a mental health crisis, we must do everything in our power to address this issue head on,” said Congressman Tony Cárdenas. “The ACCESS in Mental Health Act does just that by investing in the buildup and diversification of our mental health workforce in order to provide more Americans with the access to culturally responsive health professionals and care.”  To read the bill summary click here. To read the bill click here. The ACCESS In Mental Health Act is cosponsored by: Reps. Tony Cárdenas (CA-29), Sylvia Garcia (TX-29), Dan Goldman (NY-10), Barbara Lee (CA-12), Summer Lee (PA-12), Gwen Moore (WI-04), Seth Moulton (MA-06), Grace F. Napolitano (CA-31), Eleanor Holmes Norton (DC-00), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (NY-14), Ilhan Omar (MN-05), Delia C. Ramirez (IL-03), Shri Thanedar (MI-13), Rashida Tlaib (MI-12), Nydia M. Velázquez (NY-07), and Bonnie Watson Coleman (NJ-12) The ACCESS in Mental Health Act is endorsed by: American Psychological Association, American Federation of Teachers, Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, National Association of Social Workers, American Mental Health Counselors Association, National Association of School Psychologists, American Association of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, National Alliance on Mental Illness, Anxiety and Depression Association of America, American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, American Counseling Association, American Association for Psychoanalysis in Clinical Social Work, International OCD Foundation, Maternal Mental Health Leadership Alliance, and Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, and Young Invincibles. “The American Psychological Association strongly supports the ACCESS in Mental Health Act and applauds Representative Bowman for his leadership,” said Arthur C. Evans, Jr., PhD, CEO of the American Psychological Association. “The need for a diverse, representative, culturally and linguistically competent mental health workforce is necessary now, more than ever. The ACCESS in Mental Health Act will help make this a reality by building, strengthening, and supporting pathways to degrees in mental health fields within institutions of higher education that have historically educated predominantly students of color.”  “Too many of our students are struggling with their mental wellness, making it harder for them to do well in school, pursue their passions, and develop the skills they need in adulthood,” said Randi Weingarten, President of the American Federation of Teachers. “Whether it's cyberbullying and too much exposure to harmful accounts on social media, the isolation and loneliness from the pandemic, or the trauma from witnessing gun violence, the need for more robust mental health services in schools has gone dramatically unmet, particularly in under-resourced schools and communities. Schools should be able to provide more than just academic support, especially because often, schools are one of the only consistent places of safety for kids. Congressman Bowman's bill tackles this need head-on by increasing the number of mental health professionals available to work with students. It establishes and expands graduate programs so more folks can enter this profession, and it makes them more affordable too. Every day, AFT educators and healthcare professionals see the impact these challenges have on our next generation, so we know first-hand: it’s more important than ever to pass the ACCESS in Mental Health Act as soon as possible.” Permalink: https://bowman.house.gov/2024/4/rep-jamaal-bowman-introduces-the-access-in-mental-health-act-to-strengthen-mental-health-workforce

184,April 12,Greg Stanton,D,Ariz.-4,"Stanton, Grijalva Announce $55 Million in Shelter and Services Program Funds for Arizona’s Border Communities","Today, Congressmen Greg Stanton and Raúl Grijalva announced nearly $55 million in Shelter and Services Program funds will go to Arizona communities on the front lines of the border crisis.  The announcement comes after Stanton and Grijalva sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne Criswell, urging them to quickly allocate funding under the replenished SSP and ensure border communities were prioritized.  Maricopa County will receive $11,606,329, Pima County will receive $21,827,581, World Hunger in Maricopa will receive $11,606,329, and World Hunger in Yuma will receive $9,532,854.  “This funding couldn’t come soon enough. I’ve visited local aid groups along the border, and they’re near a breaking point—over-stretching their budgets to help care for migrant families and prevent street releases,” Stanton said. “I’ll keep working to make sure Arizona communities get their fair share of federal resources to manage this crisis.”  “I appreciate the Biden administration’s swiftness to allocate this federal funding to Arizona. I will continue to work with federal, state, local, and non-governmental organizations to ensure this funding is distributed expeditiously. As Southern Arizona communities continue to deal with the humanitarian crisis, it’s critical we provide them with the resources and funding they need,” Grijalva said. “It’s clear that the only path forward to address these issues long-term is real immigration reform to fix our broken system beginning with humane solutions, increased legal pathways, dealing with root causes, and providing more resources and personnel at the border instead of Republicans’ detrimental funding cuts and failed enforcement-only policies.”  FEMA also announced several key changes to the program—including two common-sense fixes Stanton urged Biden Administration officials to make in a December letter.

185,April 12,Dan Crenshaw,R,Tex.-2,House passes Crenshaw Amendment to include Narco-Traffickers as allowable targets under Foreign Intelligence," WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, the House of Representatives passed an amendment by Congressman Dan Crenshaw, a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, based on the Enhancing Intelligence Collection on Foreign Drug Traffickers Act of 2024, that will allow adds international narcotics trafficking to the definition of “foreign intelligence information” under FISA so the IC can specifically target foreign narco-traffickers to more effectively enable the government to stop the flow of deadly narcotics, including fentanyl, into the United States.“It is insane that we have not been able to use FISA to target the affiliates of cartels, such as bankers, accountants, and others who help operate their business. This amendment corrects that mistake,” said Congressman Crenshaw. “Make no mistake, the cartels are a multi-billion dollar business that traffic in fentanyl and other illicit drugs. They are a national security threat, and this amendment will help to dismantle the cartels.”  The amendment was passed in coordination with the Reforming Intelligence and Securing America Act, the largest reform to the Foreign Intelligence and Surveillance Act (FISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) in a generation, while reauthorizing Section 702. The bill includes 56 reforms to prevent abuses and it drastically reduces FBI querying.Background:Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act authorizes the intelligence community to collect the electronic communications of a non-U.S. person, located outside the United States, who possesses foreign intelligence information. The current categories of foreign intelligence information authorized to be collected by targeting these non-U.S. persons are covered by only three “certifications”: ### Permalink: https://crenshaw.house.gov/2024/4/house-passes-crenshaw-amendment-to-include-narco-traffickers-as-allowable-targets-under-foreign-intelligence

""Since first arriving to Congress, I have called for a standard to restrict the levels of these dangerous 'forever chemicals' in our communities’ drinking water and advocated for long-term health studies to understand the health impacts of PFAS – especially in the former Naval Air Warfare Center and Horsham Air Guard Station in my district. This final rule is another critical step in the right direction in protecting the American people from PFAS exposure and related health complications. Our work is far from complete. I look forward to continuing to advocate for federal investments in research and remediation efforts that will ensure that water sources are clean and safe for generations to come.""

187,April 11,Brian Fitzpatrick,R,Pa.-1,"Fitzpatrick, Castro Launch Bipartisan Push to Protect U.S. Development Finance Programs from Waste, Fraud, and Abuse","WASHINGTON, DC – Today, Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-1) and Joaquin Castro (TX-20) introduced the Enhancing Development Finance Corporation Oversight Act of 2024, bipartisan legislation that would grant law enforcement authority to the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the United States International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) in order to improve oversight and accountability of U.S. foreign aid programs. Six years ago, Reps. Fitzpatrick and Castro helped to establish the DFC as co-sponsors of the 2018 Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development Act (BUILD) Act. To ensure appropriate oversight over taxpayer dollars expended through the DFC, the BUILD Act simultaneously established the DFC OIG with a mission to prevent, detect, and deter waste, fraud, and abuse in DFC programs and operations. Until 2020, when the DFC OIG became operational, the OIG for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) provided oversight for DFC programs. While the USAID OIG has federal law enforcement authorities to conduct criminal investigations, including the authority to make arrests and obtain and execute search warrants, the DFC OIG does not currently possess these same authorities, constraining its oversight power. “The International Development Finance Corporation Office of Inspector General (DFC OIG) must be given law enforcement authority in order to properly provide oversight of its programs,” said Congressman Fitzpatrick. “I am proud to co-lead this bipartisan legislation with Rep. Castro that would improve oversight and accountability of U.S. foreign aid programs by granting the DFC OIG further authority to reduce unnecessary misuse of resources.” “Across the federal government, strong Inspectors General play an essential role in rooting out fraud and maintaining trust in government programs. As U.S. global development projects continue to expand, Congress needs to ensure that DFC’s OIG has the tools to maintain the highest level of integrity in DFC’s operations. This bipartisan bill will help the United States set a strong example of good governance at home and abroad, and I am thankful to Congressman Fitzpatrick for his partnership on this much-needed bipartisan reform,” said Congressman Castro. “I applaud Congressman Joaquin Castro and Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick for re-introducing the Enhancing Development Finance Corporation Oversight Act, which will provide the DFC’s Office of Inspector General with the needed law enforcement authorities to identify and eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse. As a strong proponent of the DFC, I believe it is critical that the agency's IG have the full suite of tools to properly conduct oversight of the agency's operations.  I commend Reps. Castro and Fitzpatrick for their leadership on this important issue, and I urge Congress to enact this legislation,” said former Congressman Ted Yoho, lead author of the BUILD Act. “This bipartisan measure gives the DFC’s Office of Inspector General the same authority other federal OIG’s have to ensure strong oversight and accountability of agency projects,” said Rob Mosbacher, Jr., a member of the Modernizing Foreign Assistance Network member who served as President and CEO of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) from 2005 to 2009. “I commend Congressman Castro and Fitzpatrick for their leadership.” Law enforcement authorities for Inspectors General are generally granted through the Inspector General Act of 1978, which outlines a process by which the U.S. Attorney General can delegate these authorities. The Department of Justice has indicated that it has no objections to providing law enforcement authority to the DFC OIG but has not moved to grant such authority. The Enhancing Development Finance Corporation Oversight Act of 2024 would restore appropriate law enforcement oversight to the DFC and ensure that agency programs continue to operate with integrity and efficiency.

188,April 10,Andy Barr,R,Ky.-6,"Taiwan Caucus Co-Chairs Introduce Bipartisan Resolution Reaffirming U.S. Commitment to Taiwan, Recognizing 45th Anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act","WASHINGTON, DC – Today, U.S. Representatives Andy Barr (R-KY), Ami Bera, M.D. (D-CA), Mario Díaz-Balart (R-FL), and Gerald E. Connolly (D-VA), Co-Chairs of the Congressional Taiwan Caucus, introduced a bipartisan resolution reaffirming the United States’ commitment to Taiwan and commemorating the 45th anniversary of the enactment of the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA). The resolution is cosponsored by a bipartisan group of 63 Members of Congress. Enacted on April 10, 1979, the TRA is an historic piece of legislation that embodies the United States’ commitment to make defense articles available for Taiwan’s self-defense capability and to maintain the capacity of the United States to resist any threat endangering the security of the people of Taiwan. Over the past four decades, the TRA has underpinned the robust United States-Taiwan relationship. Today, the enduring bond between the people of the United States and Taiwan serves as a beacon of democratic values, human rights, and the rule of law in the Indo-Pacific and across the world. ""For the past 45 years, the Taiwan Relations Act has been a cornerstone of peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region, embodying the strong and unwavering commitment of the United States to Taiwan,” said Congressman Andy Barr. “The United States is proud to have a deep and dynamic partnership with Taiwan, one that is based on mutual respect, shared democratic values, and a common commitment to freedom.” “The Taiwan Relations Act serves as the cornerstone of the U.S.-Taiwan relationship, fostering decades of fruitful economic, security, and trade ties,” said Congressman Ami Bera. “Taiwan’s engagement in international organizations to address shared challenges in public health, climate change, and democratic resilience exemplify its capabilities to be a force for good in the Indo-Pacific and across the globe. The United States remains steadfast in support of the people of Taiwan and our shared commitment to democratic values and the rule of law.” “I’m proud to co-sponsor this resolution commemorating the anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act which serves as the cornerstone of the U.S.-Taiwan relationship. The United States and Taiwan share core values in democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. Taiwan stands as a key ally, crucial to prosperity and stability in the region. The United States remains steadfast in its support of the people of Taiwan, and will continue to fortify this valued partnership for years to come,” said Congressman Mario Díaz-Balart. “Now more than ever, it is imperative that the United States stands shoulder to shoulder with Taiwan to celebrate our shared democratic values,” said Congressman Gerald E. Connolly. ?“What better way to reaffirm that solidarity than by recognizing the lasting importance of the Taiwan Relations Act, the foundation of our relationship. Today, we honor the friendship between the US and Taiwan and we recommit ourselves to preserving and protecting the critical partnership we share.” U.S. Senators  Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Jeff Merkley (D-OR) introduced a companion resolution in the U.S. Senate.

189,April 10,Andy Barr,R,Ky.-6,Barr Releases Statement on the Unaffordability of Bidenomics,"Washington, DC – Today, the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics released the March 2024 Inflation Report, revealing that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) has increased by 3.5% over the past year and 19.4% since President Biden took office. This marks the third consecutive month of inflation increases, demonstrating that the Biden Administration's claim that Bidenomics is effective in ""tamping down"" inflation is unequivocally false. As a result, Kentuckians will continue to feel the impact of higher prices at the gas pump, in grocery stores, and when trying to achieve the goal of homeownership.  ""As a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee and Chairman of the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Monetary Policy, it is my responsibility to monitor the ongoing inflation crisis, to ensure that the Federal Reserve is working independently to achieve its price stability mandate, and to seek solutions to counteract our national debt,"" said Congressman Barr. ""The Biden Administration's reckless spending and failed policies continue to jeopardize the futures of hardworking Americans, with the average household paying an astonishing $16,368 more a year for the same goods and services than they were on the day Joe Biden took office. The Democrats war against our capital markets and the energy sector are driving up the cost of everything. It is past time to return fiscal sanity to Washington.""

191,April 12,Cori Bush,D,Mo.-1,Congresswoman Bush Statement on House Vote to Reauthorize Warrantless Government Surveillance,"Washington, D.C. (Apr. 12, 2024) — Congresswoman Cori Bush (MO-01) released the below statement following the House passage of H.R. 7888, the Reforming Intelligence and Securing America Act. This bill reauthorizes Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) despite failing to impose a warrant requirement when the government wants to spy on U.S. citizens, and despite its inclusion of amendments dramatically expanding unnecessary surveillance of immigrants and the types of businesses that the government could compel to turn over electronic communications. “Our government has a long and dark history of illegally surveilling U.S. citizens.

192,April 10,Bonnie Watson Coleman,D,N.J.-12,Rep. Watson Coleman Issues Statement Following Vandalism of Islamic Center at Rutgers University,"Washington, D.C. — Today, Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (NJ-12) issued a statement following reports of vandalism at the Center for Islamic Life at Rutgers University, during the Islamic celebration of Eid-al-Fitr which marks the conclusion of Ramadan. Rep. Watson Coleman issued the following statement:  “Nobody should feel threatened on their campus because of their religion. That this crime was committed during Eid and targeted art with Quranic verses and other religious symbols makes it all the more despicable. I'm praying for the Rutgers University Muslim community, and trust that those responsible for this will be held accountable. “I've previously introduced a resolution condemning discrimination in all its forms, including Islamophobia, xenophobia, antisemitism, racism and ethnic or religious bigotry of any kind. It also supports the implementation of comprehensive policies to prevent and respond to hate crimes, including education and training on prevention and response, state and federal intervention, and acknowledgment of the challenges facing vulnerable groups. “Let me be clear: there is absolutely no place for hate of any kind, either on our campuses, or in our communities. Our Muslim neighbors are an integral thread in the beautifully diverse fabric that makes up our great state.  I thank Governor Murphy and Attorney General Platkin for their commitment to hold those responsible accountable.

194,April 10,Mike Levin,D,Calif.-49,Rep. Mike Levin Weighs in on Congressional Hearing Regarding Nuclear Waste Management in the United States,"Washington, D.C. – Today, Rep. Mike Levin (CA-49) sent a letter to House Energy and Commerce (E&C) Energy, Climate, and Grid Security Subcommittee Chairman Jeff Duncan (SC-03) and Ranking Member Diana DeGette (CO-01) regarding the Subcommittee’s hearing today on spent nuclear fuel. The letter details potential solutions for the approximately 90,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel stranded at nuclear power plants across the country, harming host communities and costing taxpayers billions of dollars. The letter goes on to highlight the shortcomings of the current system for storing spent nuclear fuel, including the impact it has on the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station in Rep. Levin’s district. Accordingly, the letter shares Rep. Levin’s perspective on the necessity of a consent-based approach to break the stalemate over storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel. Critically, the letter explains specific consent-based actions that Congress and the federal government must take to address our current spent nuclear fuel challenges. The Subcommittee invited Daniel Stetson, the Chairman of the San Onofre Community Engagement Panel, to share his expertise through testimony at the hearing. “It is clear to me, and I hope to you as well, that Congress must act.” writes Rep. Levin. “We have seen how a lack of consent has historically stopped projects – both public and private…. While it is encouraging that for the first time in more than a decade the government is finally progressing towards fulfilling its obligation to take title to this waste, we still have a long way to go towards a comprehensive, integrated waste management system.” Click here or read the full letter below: Dear Chairman Duncan and Ranking Member DeGette, As the Energy, Climate, and Grid Security Subcommittee conducts its hearing titled “American Nuclear Energy Expansion: Spent Fuel Policy and Innovation,” I write on behalf of my constituents in California’s 49th Congressional District to share our perspectives on spent nuclear fuel issues. I first wish to express my appreciation for the Subcommittee’s attention to such a long-standing issue that impacts Congressional districts across the country, including the one that I represent and call home. I am also grateful for the Subcommittee’s invitation to Daniel Stetson, the Chairman of the San Onofre Community Engagement Panel, to share more about the impact that the current system of spent fuel management has on our community. Since the 1950s, approximately 90,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel have been generated from commercial nuclear power generation in the United States, and this inventory grows by approximately 2,000 metric tons every single year. In 1982, Congress passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, which mandated that the U.S. government take possession of spent nuclear fuel and assigned the Department of Energy (DOE) the responsibility to manage spent nuclear fuel from commercial reactors. Then in 1987, Congress decided to designate Yucca Mountain as the sole candidate for a permanent geologic repository, without engaging in a consent-based process, and over Nevadans’ objections. More recent private storage efforts in New Mexico and Texas have not advanced due to a similar lack of consent. As a result, the 90,000 metric tons of existing spent nuclear fuel is being stored indefinitely at over 70 sites in more than 30 states, without the consent of the communities in which they are located. To say that this current situation is not ideal would be an understatement. Because the federal government was unable to fulfill its responsibility to begin disposing of spent nuclear fuel beginning in January 1998, the federal government has been found to be in partial breach of its contract with owners of commercial nuclear power reactors and must use taxpayer dollars to pay for damages of this breach. The latest Nuclear Waste Fund Audit Report by the DOE Inspector General (DOE-OIG-24-02) notes that this partial breach has cost taxpayers $10.6 billion through September 30, 2023, and that the remaining additional liabilities will total $34.1 billion. These funds add to the federal deficit without benefit of budget or appropriations considerations. This breach also leaves communities like my own to serve as de facto interim storage sites, without their consent. The decommissioning San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS) in my district currently stores more than 3.5 million pounds of spent nuclear fuel just 100 feet from the Pacific Ocean, near active fault lines, surrounded by highly populated areas and on Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton. Since I took office in 2019, one of my top priorities has been moving the spent nuclear fuel from SONGS as quickly and safely as possible. Part of this work has included working with colleagues to secure funding for DOE to restart a federal, consent-based consolidated interim storage program. In April 2023, DOE released its comprehensive outline for a 10- to 15-year plan to successfully site and store spent fuel using a consent-based siting process. This process is designed to work with local governments that want to host a site in a way that is inclusive, community-driven, phased, and adaptive. We have seen how a lack of consent has historically stopped projects – both public and private – so I am optimistic that this new, consent-based approach can break the current stalemate on the development of federal management capacity for spent nuclear fuel. While it is encouraging that for the first time in more than a decade the government is finally progressing towards fulfilling its obligation to take title to this waste, we still have a long way to go towards a comprehensive, integrated waste management system. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has found that “a variety of actions are needed to move ahead, including authorization of a new effort to determine where a disposal facility should be located and the development of a management strategy,” and that “Congress needs to take action to break the impasse over a permanent solution for commercial spent nuclear fuel.” While we do not yet know the ultimate sites for consolidated interim storage and a permanent repository, we do know the consent-based path that we must take to successfully site these facilities. We also have the benefit of years of thought and expert development of a bipartisan path forward for how we successfully manage our nuclear future. And, we can now look to the examples set by other countries, such as Finland, Sweden, and Canada, and how their work prioritized consent and was led by single purpose organizations. It is clear to me, and I hope to you as well, that Congress must act. Particularly at a time when we are considering promoting further nuclear energy development, we must also consider the technology’s full life span, including its long-term impact and environmental risks. Anything short of addressing the spent fuel problem is irresponsible and could result in a future, preventable crisis. In the immediate term, we must continue to provide funding, on a bipartisan basis, to DOE’s integrated waste management work, and ensure that annual funding is commensurate with the Department’s needs throughout the process. We must also provide DOE with clear direction to develop a total system plan for the management of spent nuclear fuel, and to build capacity and execute upon this plan. We must also amend existing law to grant the federal government the authority to site, construct and operate a consolidated interim storage site and ultimately a new geological repository, and direct that these processes be based in consent, as agreed upon by the host communities themselves. We must also work with potential host communities and states to identify benefits they can receive in exchange for their volunteering to store this waste. Further, we ought to ensure that we make progress on siting a repository in tandem with a consolidated interim storage facility, so as to provide interim storage host communities with the assurance that they will not become permanent storage sites by default. We may even consider creating a new single-purpose, autonomous organization insulated from the political process and with access to reliable and adequate funding, to handle these tasks. Communities across the country, including my own, have waited patiently for action on this matter. It is past time that we end the continued stalemate that is wasteful of taxpayer resources. The path ahead will not be easy and will require many difficult conversations. But I am committed to seeing this through, and I hope to work with you and your staff to finally fulfill the federal government’s responsibility to manage spent nuclear fuel. Sincerely, Mike Levin United States Representative ###",Congress Progressive,"['washington today mike levin sent letter house energy commerce e c energy climate grid security subcommittee chairman

195,April 11,Mike Levin,D,Calif.-49,SEEC Clean Energy Deployment Task Force Co-Chairs Reps. Mike Levin and Sean Casten Celebrate Historic Action for Clean Energy Development on Public Lands,"Washington, D.C. — Today, the Co-Chairs of the House Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition (SEEC) Clean Energy Deployment Task Force, Reps. Mike Levin (CA-49) and Sean Casten (IL-06), released the following statement in response to the finalization of the Renewable Energy Rule from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), which will spur the responsible development of clean energy on America’s public lands.  “Today, the Biden-Harris Administration announced a historic milestone in ensuring we are maximizing the ability of our public lands to fight the climate crisis,” said Reps. Levin and Casten. “We are pleased to see that we have already surpassed the goal of permitting 25 GW of renewable energy on our public lands by 2025. Now we must build on this progress and continue to aim higher. That’s why our bill, the Clean Electricity and Transmission Acceleration (CETA) Act, sets the next goal of permitting 60 GW by 2030, while also further promoting the buildout of renewable energy on public lands in a responsible, equitable, and efficient manner. “Responsible and planned development of renewables on public lands provides certainty to developers, setting the stage for successful projects while ensuring our most treasured resources are protected. We applaud the now operational projects in California, which prove this planned approach works. But we know more permitting reforms are needed to allow for more efficient development in priority areas without sacrificing environmental protections. We must also ensure that state and local communities benefit from projects in their jurisdiction. Today’s announcement strengthens our resolve to get the necessary reforms in our bill enacted into law.” Background Reps. Levin and Casten introduced the Clean Electricity and Transmission Acceleration (CETA) Act in December 2023 to serve as a consensus House Democrat vision to address the primary permitting and transmission issues holding back the American clean energy transition. The bill is endorsed by the House Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition, the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and the New Democrat Coalition. Reps. Levin and Casten co-lead the bill with 79 of their House Democratic colleagues as cosponsors. Of particular relevance to BLM’s final rule, Title IV of CETA incorporates Rep. Levin’s Public Land Renewable Energy Deployment Act (H.R. 178). This title directs the Department of Interior to permit at least 60 gigawatts of renewable energy on public lands by 2030 and responsibly incentivizes this development on priority areas, while minimizing the adverse impacts to communities and the environment. This title also directs revenues to state and local governments-- providing parity with oil and gas development-- and to fund conservation and mitigation efforts. BLM’s announcement implements authorities that Rep. Levin has championed through the Public Land Renewable Energy Development Act and helped secure in the Energy Act of 2020.

196,April 12,Mike Levin,D,Calif.-49,Rep. Levin and House Natural Resources Committee Democrats Applaud Biden Administration’s Oil and Gas Rule to Ensure a Fairer Return for American Taxpayers,"Washington, D.C.- Rep. Mike Levin (D-Calif) joined House Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member Raúl M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.), Water, Wildlife, and Fisheries Subcommittee Ranking Member Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.), and Rep. Susie Lee (D-Nev.) to issue the following statements applauding the Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM) final rule for onshore oil and gas leasing on public lands. The rule reflects long overdue fiscal reforms that were passed in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), including increased onshore royalty rates, minimum bid amounts, and rental rates; a new fee to nominate public lands for leasing; and an end to noncompetitive leasing. The rule also strengthens bonding requirements for the first time since 1960. “I applaud the Biden Administration for issuing this final rule to promote conservation and ensure a fair financial return on the profits fossil fuel companies make off our public lands,” said Rep. Levin. “The rule ends giveaways of our public lands to fossil fuel companies, holds companies accountable for cleanup costs, and updates outdated fiscal terms for onshore oil and gas leases, all while protecting our important environmental and cultural resources. Taxpayers should never foot the bill for cleaning up after Big Oil. I’m proud to see provisions of legislation I introduced included in this rule to elevate the interests of the American people over fossil fuel companies’ profits.” “When Big Oil uses our public lands, it stands to reason that they should be giving American taxpayers a fair return for the privilege,” said Ranking Member Grijalva. “That’s why Democrats worked so hard to pass reforms in the Inflation Reduction Act to return some balance to a leasing system that has favored polluters for far too long. The Biden administration is taking an important step in moving those reforms forward with this new rule. The ultimate goal is phasing out fossil fuels for good, but these new taxpayer protections will help make sure the American people aren’t getting ripped off in the meantime.” “Democrats fought long and hard to pass reforms in the Inflation Reduction Act to stop Big Oil from abusing our public lands at the cost of our communities and our climate, and this finalized rule by the Biden-Harris administration is going to ensure those reforms are implemented,” said Rep. Huffman. “This is a huge step in putting people over polluters instead of letting fossil fuel and mining industries pad their pockets and plunder our public lands with impunity.”    “For over a century, Big Oil has paid pennies on the acre to drill on our public lands—and then left taxpayers on the hook to clean up the mess,” said Rep. Katie Porter. “In Congress, I’ve fought to get rid of Big Oil’s sweetheart deal to pollute our public lands. I’m proud my proposals to end this reckless disregard for the environment—and our taxpayer dollars—are now law, and I applaud the Biden Administration for putting these much-needed reforms into action.”  “I represent working families in southern Nevada – not Big Oil & Gas. Public lands belong in public hands, not tied up in costly and unproductive fossil fuel speculation,” said Rep. Susie Lee. “Over 80 percent of Nevada lands are public lands, and I’ve made it a top priority to protect our resources and taxpayers from the outdated and wasteful approach of our speculative leasing system. Today’s announcement is another major step toward fixing the broken elements of this system, in line with my End Speculative Oil and Gas Leasing Act. I will continue to work toward a diverse, clean, and efficient energy economy that unleashes our state’s energy potential while lowering costs and protecting our public lands.”  Background The rule

Mike Levin and San Diego Congressional Delegation Secure $39 Million in Shelter and Services Program Funding to Provide Resources to Communities Receiving Migrants,"Washington, D.C. – Today, Rep. Mike Levin (CA-49) announced that he and fellow Members of San Diego’s Congressional delegation secured over $39 million in Shelter and Services Program (SSP) funding for non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and partners in the greater San Diego region that support migrant communities seeking shelter, food, and other critical resources. San Diego County and the Catholic Diocese of San Diego County each received $19,592,554 in SSP funding to assist with migrant arrivals. “All migrants deserve to be treated humanely, and San Diego is striving to be the model for communities receiving migrants across the country. I’m proud that my colleagues and I in the San Diego delegation secured this critical funding, which will help ensure migrants are welcomed with dignity and respect,” said Rep. Levin. “This funding will help our local partners provide additional resources to meet migrants’ basic human needs and reduce the impact on the existing safety net, including on homeless shelters. While I welcome this announcement, I also know we have more work to do. Congress must pass the bipartisan border security agreement, which would in part provide additional SSP funds.” “People who seek asylum and refuge in the U.S. should be treated with respect and dignity. This funding will allow San Diego nonprofits to continue to provide desperately needed humanitarian aid to individuals and families as they await an immigration court hearing or transportation to another part of the country. I thank the Biden administration and urge Congress to pass the bipartisan border security agreement, which would provide an additional $1.4 billion in SSP funds, speed up the judicial process, and give resources to Customs and Border Protection to better manage the border,” said Rep. Scott Peters (CA-50). “The Shelter and Services Program (SSP) is one of our best tools to ensure that our country is living up to our values and treating migrants and asylum seekers with dignity and respect. That’s why I’m so proud that our San Diego congressional delegation secured another $640 million in federal funds for this program, guaranteeing millions of dollars for San Diego. As always, we will keep pushing for comprehensive immigration reform to address the root causes of migration, relieve the strain on our asylum processing system, and expand the legal pathways for people to stay and work in the U.S., but this funding will go a long way to addressing our immediate concerns regarding the housing, safety, and needs of migrants and asylum seekers in San Diego,” said Rep. Sara Jacobs (CA-51). “The San Diego area has a long tradition of welcoming individuals seeking asylum and refuge with open arms. I’m proud to have worked alongside my San Diego delegation colleagues to secure this critical funding for communities and organizations aiding migrants,” said Rep. Juan Vargas (CA-52). “This funding will help make sure they have the resources they need to continue their important work to provide migrant communities with food, shelter, and other critical services.” In February, Rep. Levin led a letter signed by fellow Members of San Diego’s Congressional delegation to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas urging DHS to release available funding for SSP under Fiscal Year 2024 (FY24) Continuing Resolutions (CR). ###",Congress Progressive,"['washington today mike levin announced fellow member san diego congressional delegation secured million

198,April 11,Jared Huffman,D,Calif.-2,Rep. Huffman Statement on 2024 Salmon Season Closure,"Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Representative Jared Huffman (CA-02), Ranking Member of the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Water, Wildlife, and Fisheries, released the following statement regarding the Pacific Fishery Management Council’s vote to cancel salmon fishing season off the California: “Last year’s California’s salmon season closure was a crushing blow for our state. And now we’re facing the unprecedented back-to-back closures of the entire California salmon fishery.  This is a new low – it’s not just devastating, it’s unacceptable,” said Rep. Huffman. “We just finished getting federal approval for last year’s California salmon disaster. I was relieved that with the reforms I’ve passed in Congress and all the political pressure we worked to build, the federal approval process was somewhat faster.  But the amount of disaster money is not nearly enough for the needs of fishermen, tribes, businesses, and families who depend on healthy salmon fisheries – and now we have to start all over again for second consecutive disaster year. “We must do better. On disaster relief, the state must speed up the process for quantifying impacts and the federal government must approve disaster funds faster and at higher levels. But we must also acknowledge that this scramble for federal fishery disaster funds is not the solution to the terrible downward spiral for California salmon fisheries. The solution is to prevent fishery disasters.  That requires confronting wrongheaded policies that are killing salmon – failing to protect cold water supplies, starving rivers and tributaries of flows salmon need to survive, and over-pumping in the Delta during sensitive times for migrating salmon,” Huffman concluded.  In February of this year, Rep. Huffman secured $20 million in relief funds through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for California’s fishing community. This followed continued pressure from the congressman to secure this relief for the 2023 Sacramento River Fall Chinook and Klamath River Fall Chinook and inland salmon fisheries disasters. In April 2023, Huffman, Padilla, and Panetta led their colleagues in an urgent letter to President Joe Biden and Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, calling for them to swiftly declare a federal fishery disaster. Earlier that month, Rep. Huffman held a press conference with Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, Representative Kevin Mullin, and fishing industry stakeholders to call attention to this disaster and highlight the people who will bear the brunt of the impacts of closing the salmon season. In addition to regular follow up with NOAA, Rep. Huffman held a call directly with NOAA Administrator Dr. Rick Spinrad to continue the pressure and encourage him to prompt action. As part of his long-standing efforts to improve disaster relief for fisheries, Congressman Huffman was able to help secure an additional $300 million for fishery disaster declarations Fiscal Year 2023 Omnibus Appropriations bill. Congress also authorized new bipartisan fishery disaster relief language based on Congressman Jared Huffman and Senator Roger Wicker’s Fishery Resource Disasters Improvement Act. This language streamlines the process for declaring a federal fishery disaster and helps to quickly provide relief to affected communities. It also extends eligibility for federal fishery disaster funds not only to commercial fisheries, but also to charter fishing businesses and impacted tribes.",Congress Progressive,"['washington today

199,April 12,Jared Huffman,D,Calif.-2,"Huffman, Committee Democrats Applaud Biden Administration’s Oil and Gas Rule to Ensure a Fairer Return for American Taxpayers","Water, Wildlife, and Fisheries Subcommittee Ranking Member Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member Raúl M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.),  Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.), Rep. Susie Lee (D-Nev.), and Mike Levin (D-Calif.) today issued the following statements applauding the Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM) final rule for onshore oil and gas leasing on public lands. The rule reflects long overdue fiscal reforms that were passed in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), including increased onshore royalty rates, minimum bid amounts, and rental rates; a new fee to nominate public lands for leasing; and an end to noncompetitive leasing. The rule also strengthens bonding requirements for the first time since 1960. “Democrats fought long and hard to pass reforms in the Inflation Reduction Act to stop Big Oil from abusing our public lands at the cost of our communities and our climate, and this finalized rule by the Biden-Harris administration is going to ensure those reforms are implemented,” said Rep. Huffman. “This is a huge step in putting people over polluters instead of letting fossil fuel and mining industries pad their pockets and plunder our public lands with impunity.”    “When Big Oil uses our public lands, it stands to reason that they should be giving American taxpayers a fair return for the privilege,” said Ranking Member Grijalva. “That’s why Democrats worked so hard to pass reforms in the Inflation Reduction Act to return some balance to a leasing system that has favored polluters for far too long. The Biden administration is taking an important step in moving those reforms forward with this new rule. The ultimate goal is phasing out fossil fuels for good, but these new taxpayer protections will help make sure the American people aren’t getting ripped off in the meantime.” “For over a century, Big Oil has paid pennies on the acre to drill on our public lands—and then left taxpayers on the hook to clean up the mess,” said Rep. Katie Porter. “In Congress, I’ve fought to get rid of Big Oil’s sweetheart deal to pollute our public lands. I’m proud my proposals to end this reckless disregard for the environment—and our taxpayer dollars—are now law, and I applaud the Biden Administration for putting these much-needed reforms into action.”  “I represent working families in southern Nevada – not Big Oil & Gas. Public lands belong in public hands, not tied up in costly and unproductive fossil fuel speculation,” said Rep. Susie Lee. “Over 80 percent of Nevada lands are public lands, and I’ve made it a top priority to protect our resources and taxpayers from the outdated and wasteful approach of our speculative leasing system. Today’s announcement is another major step toward fixing the broken elements of this system, in line with my End Speculative Oil and Gas Leasing Act. I will continue to work toward a diverse, clean, and efficient energy economy that unleashes our state’s energy potential while lowering costs and protecting our public lands.”  “I applaud the Biden Administration for issuing this final rule to promote conservation and ensure a fair financial return on the profits fossil fuel companies make off our public lands,” said Rep. Levin. “The rule ends giveaways of our public lands to fossil fuel companies, holds companies accountable for cleanup costs, and updates outdated fiscal terms for onshore oil and gas leases, all while protecting our important environmental and cultural resources. Taxpayers should never foot the bill for cleaning up after Big Oil. I’m proud to see provisions of legislation I introduced included in this rule to elevate the interests of the American people over fossil fuel companies’ profits.” Background The rule reflects legislation championed by Natural Resources Committee Democrats, including the following: 117th Congress: 118th Congress:",Congress Progressive,"['water wildlife fishery subcommittee ranking member
