Now we are seeing that plan in action, with well over 15 million jobs created since I took office, working-age women employed at a record high rate, wages rising faster than prices, and unemployment below 4 percent for a record 27 months in a row. There s more work to do. I have a plan to lower the cost of rent and homeownership by building 2 million homes; to cut taxes for middle-class families and American workers; and to continue making health care, prescription drugs, inhalers, and insulin more affordable.

They are our neighbors, classmates, and loved ones. Our nation is fortunate that America is their home. Thanks to Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), more than 800,000 Dreamers have been able to live, study, and work in the only home they have ever known while making our nation a better place. It is why I fought to defend and protect DACA as Attorney General of California and a U.S. Senator from California. Now as Vice President, I have worked alongside President Biden to take steps to preserve and fortify DACA. Today, we are building on this progress by ensuring DACA recipients also have access to affordable health care, which will improve the health of all communities. This announcement will bring relief to more than 100,000 people and help them thrive while working to achieve their aspirations. President Biden and I will continue to do everything in our power to protect DACA, but it is only a temporary solution. Congress must act to ensure Dreamers have the permanent protections they deserve.\",\n","                               \"President Biden Announces Final Rule that will Allow Eligible DACA Recipients to Enroll in Affordable Care Act Coverage Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is expanding access to affordable, quality health care coverage to Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients.  In 2012, President Obama and then Vice President Biden created the DACA policy to transform the lives of eligible Dreamers – young people who came to this country as children—allowing them to live and work lawfully in our country.  Over the last decade, DACA has brought stability, possibility, and progress to hundreds of thousands of Dreamers. While President Biden continues to call on Congress to provide a pathway to citizenship to Dreamers and others, he is committed to protecting and preserving DACA and providing Dreamers with the opportunities and support they need to succeed, including access to affordable, quality health care coverage.  Thanks to the Biden-Harris Administration s actions, today s final rule will remove the prohibition on DACA recipients  eligibility for Affordable Care Act coverage for the first time, and is projected to help more than 100,000 young people gain health insurance.  Starting in November, DACA recipients can apply for coverage through HealthCare.gov and state-based marketplaces, where they may qualify for financial assistance to help them purchase quality health insurance. Four out of five consumers have found a plan for less than $10 a month, with millions saving an average of about $800 a year on their premiums. President Biden and Vice President Harris believe that health care should be a right, not a privilege. Together, they promised to protect and strengthen the Affordable Care Act, lowering costs and expanding coverage so that every American has the peace of mind that health insurance brings.  Today s final rule delivers on the President s commitment by giving DACA recipients that same peace and opportunity. Today s rule also reinforces the President s enduring commitment to DACA recipients and Dreamers, who contribute daily to the strength and vitality of our communities and our country.  On day one of his Administration, President Biden committed to preserving and fortifying the DACA policy.  While only Congress can provide Dreamers permanent status and a pathway to citizenship, the Biden-Harris Administration has continued to vigorously defend DACA against ongoing legal challenges and strengthened DACA by codifying the 2012 policy in a final rule.\",\n","                               \"Today, my Administration is expanding affordable, quality health care coverage to Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients. Dreamers are our loved ones, our nurses, teachers, and small business owners. And they deserve the promise of health care just like all of us. Nearly twelve years ago, President Obama and I announced the DACA program to allow our young people to live and work in the only country they ve called home. Since then, DACA has provided more than 800,000 Dreamers with the ability to work lawfully, pursue an education, and contribute their immense talents to make our communities better and stronger. I m proud of the contributions of Dreamers to our country and committed to providing Dreamers the support they need to succeed. That s why I ve previously directed the Department of Homeland Security to take all appropriate actions to “preserve and fortify” DACA. And that s why today we are taking this historic step to ensure that DACA recipients have the same access to health care through the Affordable Care Act as their neighbors. On Day One of my administration, I sent a comprehensive immigration reform plan to Congress to protect Dreamers and their families. Only Congress can provide Dreamers permanent status and a pathway to citizenship. Congress must act.\",\n","                               \"The free press is an essential pillar of democracy, and the women and men worldwide who uphold it do vital work. Journalists go to great lengths to expose corruption, document wars and other urgent world events, bring to light threats to public safety, and bring citizens the information they need to participate fully in their societies. Some journalists have given their lives to this work. Others have suffered grievous injuries or lost their freedom. Journalism should not be a crime anywhere on Earth. On World Press Freedom Day, we honor the bravery and sacrifice of journalists and media workers around the world risking everything in pursuit of truth. This is especially resonant today. 2023 was one of the deadliest years for journalists in recent memory. One reason for that is the war in Gaza, where far too many journalists, the vast majority of them Palestinian, have been killed. Additionally, over 300 journalists were imprisoned around the world last year – the highest number in decades.  In Russia, American journalists Evan Gershkovich and Alsu Kurmasheva have been imprisoned in connection with their work for the Wall Street Journal and for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. And Austin Tice is still being held hostage in Syria after nearly twelve years. On World Press Freedom Day, the United States calls for the immediate and unconditional release of all journalists who have been put behind bars for simply doing their jobs. And we call for the protection of journalists everywhere, including during military operations. My Administration will continue to support free and independent media worldwide. We have brought together a coalition of countries to counter the proliferation and misuse of commercial spyware, which is often used to monitor journalists worldwide. And we re taking action to combat crimes against journalists, strengthen security for independent media outlets, and provide legal support for investigative journalists around the world. In the coming weeks, I will be taking executive action in response to the global crackdown on press freedom, as exemplified by the wrongful detention of journalists around the world. I will declare this crackdown on press freedom a grave threat to national security and will authorize measures, including sanctions and visa bans, against those who take abusive actions to silence the press. Journalists and media workers are an essential part of any democracy, because well-informed dissent is critical to building stronger and more successful societies. Today and every day, we recognize their courage, support their right to do their jobs, and stand with them for press freedom.\",\n","                               \"This evening, First Lady Jill Biden will host the first-ever “Teachers of the Year” State Dinner at the White House.

This event will honor the 2024 National Teacher of the Year, Missy Testerman from Tennessee, and the State Teachers of the Year from across the country for their excellence in teaching and commitment to students  learning.  Ahead of tonight s dinner and Teacher Appreciation Week, the Biden-Harris Administration announced new efforts to strengthen the teaching profession and support schools across the country. In an excerpt from her prepared remarks, Dr. Biden welcomes teachers to the White House, saying: “Tonight, we celebrate you, because teaching isn t just a job. It s a calling, and all of you were called to this profession for a reason. You believe that a better world is possible – and you make that world real, one student at a time. To answer the call of teaching, is in itself, an act of hope. You look at your students and don t just see who they are today – you see all the possibility of tomorrow. You help them find the light within themselves, and that light lives on in all of you.” As a classroom teacher for over 30 years, Dr. Biden continues to teach English and writing at Northern Virginia Community College, where she has been a professor since 2009. From championing teacher recruitment and retention, opportunities for career-connected learning, and more affordable options for education after high school, including free community college, Dr. Biden continues to shine a spotlight on educators and the teaching profession. This is the fourth year Dr. Biden has welcomed the National and State Teachers of the Year for a celebration at the White House. The Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO), the U.S. Department of Education, American Federation of Teachers, and the National Education Association are supporting this event. CCSSO oversees the National Teacher of the Year Program, which identifies exceptional teachers across the country, recognizes their effective work in the classroom, engages them in a year of professional learning, and amplifies their voices.

Operation Free Virginia seized over 17,000 pounds of illicit drugs and 18,000 pounds of prescription medications during the 30-day operation. “I m immensely proud of the work done by The Secretariat of Public Safety and Homeland Security and Virginia State Police,” said Governor Glenn Youngkin. “Through their tireless efforts this first-of-its-kind operation seized enough fentanyl to kill more people than the entire population of Virginia. While we still have a long way to go towards our goal of eliminating fentanyl in the Commonwealth, these results are significant, and proof of the positive work being done in our communities.” “The hard work of law enforcement, community partners and stakeholders across the Commonwealth, builds on our continued efforts to make Virginians safer and healthier,” said First Lady of Virginia Suzanne S. Youngkin. “We will continue to educate around the dangers of fentanyl — stressing that ‘It Only Takes One  pill to take a life and one important conversation to save a life.” “Through the leadership of Governor Youngkin and the success of Operation Free Virginia, our Commonwealth has become safer,” said Secretary of Public Safety and Homeland Security Terry Cole. “The Governor s operation brought 114 state, federal, county, campus, and municipal agencies together to protect our Commonwealth. It s a reminder that when we work together in an all of government approach, we can make our communities more secure. I m happy to see that Virginia is one step closer in our fight to eliminate the deadly impacts of fentanyl.” In May 2023 Governor Youngkin signed Executive Order 26 to help combat the fentanyl epidemic in Virginia. The order, amongst other things, directed the Secretary of Public Safety and Homeland Security to develop a strategic plan for law enforcement agencies across the Commonwealth to combat illicit trafficking and the sale of fentanyl in Virginia. In response, the Department of Public Safety and Homeland Security, being led by the Virginia State Police conducted a statewide fentanyl operation focusing on increased enforcement, whole of community training, education, and partnerships to reduce supply and demand across the Commonwealth. The data collected from the operation detailed clear and significant positive results in stemming fentanyl s devastating impact in in our communities.

Overdose has become the leading cause of unnatural death in the Commonwealth, with an average of five Virginians dying from fentanyl every day. The campaign seeks to increase the public s awareness that it only takes one bad decision or one counterfeit pill to end a life. “In Virginia, we ve taken critical steps to combat the fentanyl epidemic by directing a new fentanyl-fighting strategy through Executive Order 26, working to ensure parents are notified within 24 hours of an overdose, and holding the manufacturers and distributors of illicit drugs accountable,” said Governor Glenn Youngkin. “On Fentanyl Awareness Day, we are more resolved, more emboldened, more unified and more focused than ever before to ensure no more Virginians die as a result of this fentanyl epidemic.” “National Fentanyl Awareness Day presents an opportunity to remember lives lost and recommit to educating every Virginian about the dangers of this most dangerous synthetic drug,” said First Lady Suzanne S. Youngkin. “We remain focused on providing the information and support families and communities need to protect themselves and their loved ones — to save lives.” “The Governor, First Lady and I have made combating fentanyl a consistent focus of the administration,” said Secretary of Health and Human Resources John Littel. “Holding REVIVE! trainings at each of our events during Fentanyl Awareness Day increases the number of Virginians who are equipped with the knowledge needed to safeguard their well-being and the resources to save a life. We are excited to partner with coaches in talking to their teams about the dangers of fentanyl and looking forward to working with additional athletic teams.” The first event celebrated the opening of the flagship Four Truths Recovery home in Roanoke.

When adversaries seek to destabilize the globe it often falls on our armed forces to meet the gathering threats and defend freedom. Since the Commonwealth is home to national strategic assets like the Pentagon, Quantico and the largest naval base in the world – Virginians know all too well the commitment and sacrifice that comes with serving in the military. Their courage and dedication to keeping Virginia and America safe is profound. I m honored to serve as their home state governor,” said Governor Glenn Youngkin.\",\n","                                  \"RICHMOND, VA - The Virginia Board of Education today approved the establishment of six additional Lab Schools across the Commonwealth, from Southwest Virginia to Hampton Roads and Northern Virginia. The higher education partners include Emory & Henry College, George Mason University, Roanoke College, Old Dominion University – Newport News, Old Dominion University – Chesapeake, and Paul D. Camp Community College. “With the addition of these six Lab Schools, the Board has created enriching, future-focused opportunities that reach students across Virginia,” said Governor Glenn Youngkin. “These schools are establishing innovative pathways for students to explore potential careers and be better prepared for the future, with a specific focus on addressing the needs and demands of their regions. These Lab Schools are not just shaping the future of our students, they re also shaping the future of Virginia.” “I am very proud of the higher education institutions, school divisions, and community partners who have brought forth programs that prepare Virginia students for both post-secondary education and meaningful career options,” said Secretary of Education Aimee Guidera. “On behalf of the Board, I am excited to approve these six Lab Schools today and help create innovative educational programs that serve students, educators, and the communities in which they are based. It s been inspiring to see the progression of these schools, and we are looking forward to seeing the impact they make in the years to come,” said President of the Virginia Board of Education Grace Turner Creasey. “The six schools approved today are a direct result of the innovative mindset of the representatives from the higher education institutions and school divisions who transformed their vision and, with the support of their communities, made these Lab Schools a reality. I am grateful for every person who worked to create the foundation for these powerful programs, as well as the people who worked behind the scenes to make these Lab Schools a reality for Virginia students. These Lab Schools are poised to help students across the Commonwealth meet the industry demands and standards for the in-demand careers of the future,” said Superintendent of Public Instruction Lisa Coons. Virginia Lab Schools are designed to stimulate the development of innovative education programs for Virginia students from preschool through Grade 12. In partnership with local employers and community organizations, their academic programs focus on expanding opportunities for students with exposure to workplaces designed to highlight the important role success in academics plays in life. Lab schools offer unique and focused opportunities to help students understand with greater clarity the career pathways for life after high school graduation. Under the current budget in place until June 30, 2024, the Commonwealth has a statutory requirement and dedicated funding to move forward with Lab School development. The Board s approvals today continue to fulfill those requirements in partnership with Virginia s community colleges, universities, private and public schools, and local communities to give students across the Commonwealth innovative opportunities to build for future success. Below is an overview of the six Lab Schools that were approved by the Board earlier today: Emory & Henry College Emory & Henry College s proposed Lab School, the Southwest Virginia Healthcare Excellence Academy Lab School (SWVA-HEALS), is a collaborative partnership between Emory & Henry College (EMC); the school divisions of Smyth County, Wythe County, Washington County, and the City of Bristol; Virginia Highlands Community College; Wytheville Community College; the A. Linwood Holton Governor s School; and the Southwest Virginia Higher Education Center. The SWVA-HEALS program establishes a high school career academy for students in Grades 10-12 to serve as a pipeline for preparing future healthcare professionals to meet the workforce shortages in Southwest Virginia. The mission of SWVA-HEALS is to work collaboratively with regional education, healthcare, and community partners to provide a rigorous, high-quality learning environment that promotes increased awareness of potential healthcare careers and prepares college and career ready students to pursue the required college degrees and professional credentials that lead to healthcare careers and increase the number of future healthcare providers practicing in Southwest Virginia. “Emory & Henry and our collaborative partners are thrilled to move forward in implementing the HEALS program. This unique career academy program will provide high school students with the strong science and healthcare-related curriculum pathways and work-based learning experiences needed to successfully pursue a career in healthcare. We truly believe the HEALS program will provide an outstanding college and career preparation for students while also helping to reduce the healthcare workforce shortages in Southwest Virginia,” said Dr. A. Louise Fincher, Senior Vice President and Dean of Emory & Henry College s School of Health Sciences. George Mason University George Mason University s proposed Lab School, Accelerated College and Employability Skills (ACCESS) Academy Lab School, is a collaborative partnership between George Mason University (GMU), Northern Virginia Community College (NOVA), and Loudoun County Public Schools (LCPS). The mission of ACCESS Academy is to provide new innovative pathways for traditionally underserved students toward high demand, well compensated careers, while simultaneously working toward two- and four-year degrees to maximize their earning potential. ACCESS Academy is designed to support the transition of at-risk learners into college and high-demand careers, with a preliminary focus on Information Technology. In addition, ACCESS Academy will incorporate employability skills, innovative teaching and learning methods, and experiences co-designed with industry partners, researchers, and instructional faculty. ACCESS Academy is a bold step toward creating pathways for traditionally underserved students into high-demand, well-compensated careers, all while earning two- and four-year degrees. Our focus on innovative, problem-based learning, 21st Century skills, and robust wraparound support ensures that ACCESS Academy students are well-equipped to meet the evolving demands of the workforce. Our vision is to prepare adaptable, lifelong learners who can collaboratively and creatively solve complex problems, no matter how technology and work environments change. This is about more than education; it's about empowering students to build a better future for themselves and their communities,” said Dr. Ingrid Guerra-López, Dean of George Mason University s College of Education and Human Development. Roanoke College Roanoke College s proposed Lab School, Explore@RC, is a partnership between Roanoke College and Salem City Schools. Explore@RC s mission is to cultivate a diverse and inclusive learning community where all students can reach their full potential, regardless of their background or circumstances. The program features three career-oriented pathways: education/global studies, STEM/healthcare, and communications/civic engagement. The program will culminate in a senior capstone course with project-based learning and fieldwork related to the selected career pathway. These pathways tie directly into workforce needs in the Roanoke region and will set students up for success in their chosen pathway through academic preparation and real-world learning opportunities. Explore@RC students will have the unique opportunity to experience the critical exposure of class attendance on Roanoke College s campus. “Explore@RC is an exciting opportunity for Roanoke College to work closely with our community partners and a new group of students,” said Dr. Lisa Stoneman, chair of Roanoke College s Education Department. “Our team has been planning collaboratively with Salem City Schools for more than a year to prepare for the arrival of our first cohort, and now that we have official approval, we're ready to hit the ground running.” Paul D. Camp Community College Paul D. Camp Community College s proposed Lab School, the Isle of Maritime Trades Academy (IMTA), is a result of a partnership between Paul D. Camp Community College and the Isle of Wight County Public Schools. IMTA is designed to provide a high school-to-college-to-work pipeline in a partnership between Paul D. Camp Community College, Isle of Wight County Public Schools, and initial primary corporate partner, Huntington Ingalls Industries-Newport News Shipbuilding (NNS). IMTA will educate and train a significant and sustainable number of students in maritime trades annually, through innovative, integrated, experience- and project-based career technical education, so that academy graduates are workplace ready upon high school graduation. The program will have a significant impact on students, families, community, and the maritime industrial workforce by preparing students for immediate employment in high-demand skilled trades with regional maritime employers, in career pathways that provide a family-sustaining income and opportunities for additional career advancement through further education or training after high school. The overall goal of the IMTA Lab School is to graduate students who possess in-demand technical and workplace-ready skills for middle skill jobs with NNS and similar employers, and to position students in career pathways that provide options for advancement with additional education or training. “The Isle Maritime Trades Academy (IMTA) is not just an avenue to a career pathway for Lab School students from Isle of Wight and the surrounding school districts, it will also allow them to be a part of something bigger than themselves- national security. Lab School students will ultimately have the opportunity to help build Navy Ships that will ensure the nations defense and security. In addition, the IMTA will help our partners at Newport News Shipyard fill the projected 20,000 employees needed over the next five years,” said Dr. Corey L. McCray, President at Paul D. Camp Community College. Old Dominion University - Newport News Old Dominion University - Newport News  proposed Lab School, Maritime Engineering and Environmental Studies Academy (MEESA), was developed by Old Dominion University – Newport News in collaboration with Newport News Public Schools. MEESA focuses heavily on student guided learning through STEM, Experiential Learning, Guided Inquiry, Design Thinking, Career and Technical Education, as well as internships and job shadowing opportunities. MEESA will align with education, research, and innovation efforts at Old Dominion University around maritime engineering, as well as with the Virginia Digital Maritime Center, an initiative designed to enhance the region s maritime workforce. MEESA s overall vision is to be a beacon of excellence; cultivate stewards of the seas and guardians of the environment; and prepare students for a world of digital engineering, as it pioneers transformative education, research, and hands-on exploration for a brighter, more resilient maritime future. “Maritime industries are one of the key economic drivers in our region. In order to best prepare the future maritime workforce and enhance economic and workforce development in Hampton Roads, it is critical that high school students are introduced to the subject matter. Just as critical is the use of evidence-based strategies to teach those students. Working with the Newport News Public Schools district, the Maritime Engineering and Environmental Studies Academy will build on the collaborative strengths in our region and address both student and teacher development,” said Dr. Karen Sanzo, Director of the Institute for Design Thinking and Leadership Development at Old Dominion University. Old Dominion University – Chesapeake Old Dominion University - Chesapeake s Lab School, Computer Science Lab School (CSLS), was developed by Old Dominion University - Chesapeake in collaboration with Chesapeake Public Schools  Oscar Smith Middle School. CSLS s mission is to empower underrepresented middle school students through transformative opportunities and experiences in combination with an innovative focus on computer science principles. CSLS is designed to prepare students for the technology talent pipeline, have a regional focus that aligns with workforce needs, and increase the number of K-12 teachers prepared to teach Computer Science in support of students. “ODU is committed to building the next generation of computing professionals. We are excited to work with Chesapeake Public Schools and the amazing professionals at Oscar Smith Middle to create the Computer Science Lab School. Collectively we will identify, design, and implement the most effective teaching strategies to ensure that middle school students receive the foundation they need to embark on future computing pipelines,” said Dr. Sanzo.\",\n","                                  \"NORFOLK, VA – Governor Glenn Youngkin and First Lady Suzanne S. Youngkin yesterday donated a quarter of the Governors salary to The New E3 School in Norfolk, Virginia. The Governor and First Lady have pledged to donate the entirety of the gubernatorial annual salary to nonprofit organizations doing great work across Virginia and today they are preserving that promise. “I am proud to support The New E3 School in its mission to uplift Virginia's students with a strong foundation for learning,” said Governor Glenn Youngkin. E3 s commitment to early education, innovative curricula, and giving all students the opportunity for an excellent education is remarkable. This administration remains wholly committed to equipping every young Virginian with the tools they need to succeed and uplifting key partners like E3. As we build up the next generation of Virginia s families and workforce, literacy is an essential competency. The addition of the Lisa Robertson Literacy Lab and Library underscores the New E3 School s commitment to high quality education and lifting up every student,” said First Lady of Virginia Suzanne S. Youngkin. “The New E3 School is a model for all, demonstrating clearly that high quality education and social involvement makes a difference.” “Too many of Virginia s children cannot read proficiently by third grade. The first eight years are a critical time in language and literacy development. The Governor, First Lady and General Assembly have made literacy a top priority to help every child read. E3 is grateful for that commitment, and we look forward to our continued partnership.” said President and CEO of E3:Elevate Early Education and The New E3 School, Lisa Howard. The decision to donate the second-quarter gubernatorial salary to The New E3 School reinforces the Governor and First Lady s commitment to getting Virginia s youngest learners back on track. The $43,750 donation to the New E3 School will help fund the Lisa Robertson Literacy Lab and Library, support tuition costs for students in need, and help fund scholarships for students currently on The New E3 School s waitlist. Their donation was matched by the Robertson Family Foundation in honor of the late Lisa Robertson, a founding board member and active volunteer at E3:Elevate Early Education and The New E3 School, to create the Lisa Robertson Literacy Lab and Library. Together these donations will support the Youngkin s commitment to providing access to high quality early education for all children in Virginia and bridging the literacy gap exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) showed Virginia s fourth graders recording the largest declines in reading and math in the nation, and for the first time in 30 years, falling below the national average in reading and barely above the national average in math. To combat this, the Youngkin Administration made early learning a top priority, signing the Virginia Literacy Act (VLA) in 2022, one of the most comprehensive policies in the nation. Notably, the VLA ensures that teachers are trained in the science of reading by using an evidence-based curriculum and holds school systems accountable to monitor early reading progress while keeping parents aware of such assessments. In 2023, Governor Youngkin announced the ALL IN VIRGINIA campaign to complement the Virginia Literacy Act and accelerate Covid-era learning loss recovery. ALL IN VA is a three-pronged approach that implements best practice for improved attendance, literacy, and learning. As part of their ongoing personal investment to improve education opportunities for Virginia s children, last summer the Governor and First Lady donated their third quarter salary to the Life Enrichment Center in Virginia Beach, a volunteer-based nonprofit created to help young students learn to read and become adept in using technology. About E3: E3:Elevate Early Education + The New E3 School raise awareness, advocate and create innovative initiatives to give children and families equitable access to high-quality early education. Our work started in 2005 as one of the first early education initiatives in Virginia. Along with our many public-private partners, we have worked together to increase equitable access to quality for thousands of children, families and early learning programs. The early years are a critical time in language and literacy development and build a strong foundation for learning. Learn more about our early literacy initiatives, the Kids Need to Read campaign and our BIG WINS for Kids at e3va.org. Setting the standard of excellence in early education, E3 worked alongside UVA to develop the STREAMin3 curricula, training educators to focus on the five core skills (relate, regulate, think, communicate and move) and the six STREAM skills (science, technology, reading, engineering, arts and math) in the classroom. As demonstrated at the New E3 School, this unique curriculum and model of interactive learning has led to policy change and increased state investment, ensuring more children have access to quality education programs.\"\n","]\n","Youngkin['Cleaned Press Release Text'] = Youngkin['Press Release Text'].apply(clean_text)"],"metadata":{"id":"P5N4kZgx9cLL","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715637177095,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":704,"user":{"displayName":"Nico Rapallo","userId":"15385192669570713781"}}},"execution_count":36,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["Youngkin_caucus = caucus_model.predict(Youngkin['Cleaned Press Release Text'])\n","Youngkin_caucus = pd.DataFrame(Youngkin_caucus)\n","Youngkin_caucus.rename(columns = {0:'Progressive'}, inplace = True)\n","Youngkin_caucus.rename(columns = {1:'Freedom'}, inplace = True)\n","Youngkin_caucus.rename(columns = {2:'Main Street'}, inplace = True)\n","Youngkin_caucus.rename(columns = {3:'New Democrat'}, inplace = True)\n","print(\"Progressive: \", end=\"\"), print(Youngkin_caucus['Progressive'].mean())\n","print(\"New Democrat: \", end=\"\"), print(Youngkin_caucus['New Democrat'].mean())\n","print(\"Main Street: \", end=\"\"), print(Youngkin_caucus['Main Street'].mean())\n","print(\"Freedom: \", end=\"\"), print(Youngkin_caucus['Freedom'].mean())\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"6mWA6E0aaDrf","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715637178447,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":404,"user":{"displayName":"Nico Rapallo","userId":"15385192669570713781"}},"outputId":"dfa2e24e-c354-4c01-fbe0-ccedd38540fa"},"execution_count":37,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["1/1 [==============================] - 0s 32ms/step\n","Progressive: 0.3143447\n","New Democrat: 0.23294261\n","Main Street: 0.23102987\n","Freedom: 0.22168279\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["(None, None)"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":37}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["Youngkin_party = party_model.predict(Youngkin['Cleaned Press Release Text'])\n","Youngkin_party = pd.DataFrame(Youngkin_party)\n","Youngkin_party[0].mean()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"7ypr-OMza4Ga","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715636658768,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":308,"user":{"displayName":"Nico Rapallo","userId":"15385192669570713781"}},"outputId":"0218a5fb-ef2d-4fa7-9582-22eb0069051f"},"execution_count":32,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["1/1 [==============================] - 0s 130ms/step\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["0.5076688"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":32}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Trump Analysis\n","Could not find official press releases, so we used his posts to Truth Social instead\n"],"metadata":{"id":"40E5XOslYuCs"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["Trump = pd.DataFrame()\n","Trump['Press Release Text'] = ['With you at my side, we will demolish the Deep State, we will expel the warmongers from our government, we will drive out the globalists, we will cast out the Communists, Marxists, and Fascists, we will throw off the sick political class that hates our Country, we will rout the Fake News media, we will Drain the Swamp, and we will liberate our Country from these tyrants and villains once and for all.
