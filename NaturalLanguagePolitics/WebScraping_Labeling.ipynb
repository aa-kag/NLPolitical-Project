They want policy change.” “…policies that see them, center them, and serve them, and they would prefer that over bouquets, verbal or otherwise.” Video (YouTube) BOSTON\\xa0–\\xa0Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07)\\xa0marked Mother’s Day with a powerful speech on the House floor in which she called for meaningful policy change to better support mothers and caregivers, including maternal health justice, affordable childcare, universal paid leave, reproductive freedom, home and community-based services, and more. Footage from the speech can be found\\xa0here\\xa0and a transcript is below. Transcript: In Powerful Mother’s Day Speech, Ayanna Pressley Calls for Policy Change to Support Mothers & Caregivers\\xa0 March 8, 2024 U.S House of Representatives This time of year, Mr. Speaker, we wax poetic about the contributions of mothers. We call their work valued, their love endless, their role invaluable.\\xa0 Mr. Speaker, mothers across America don’t want a Hallmark card. They want policy change.\\xa0 I grew up in a small storefront church on the southside of Chicago and my grandfather was the pastor there. And even as a pastor, he would often say that he would rather see a sermon than hear one.\\xa0 Mr. Speaker, the mothers of this country are deserving of policies. Policies that see them, center them, and serve them, and they would prefer that over bouquets, verbal or otherwise.\\xa0 We tell mothers that caregiving is their greatest contribution, and then undermine them at every turn.\\xa0 We tell women that motherhood is aspirational and the greatest contribution they will ever make, while for many a safe pregnancy is a privilege and not a right.\\xa0 Then we thrust them into a broken healthcare system that denies their bodily autonomy, criminalizes pregnancy outcomes, and jeopardizes their lives.\\xa0 We tell mothers that the work of keeping that baby warm, safe and fed is the highest calling, and then we allow negligence and policy gaps to create a baby formula shortage in the midst of a pandemic as mothers panic to meet a most basic need.\\xa0 We tell mothers that they must work like they don’t have children and parent like they don’t work, while we fail to pass a universal paid leave policy thrusting mamas and caregivers back into the workplace and mere weeks after their babies are born.\\xa0 We tell mothers that it takes a village and we’re so proud to be a part of theirs, and then we fail to invest in safe, affordable childcare.\\xa0 We tell mothers that they are their children’s first teachers, and they send their little ones out into the world with a hopeful heart, and then a stark reality keeps them up at night — that policy gaps will fail to keep that child safe from a gun on the block or in the classroom.\\xa0 We tell mothers that in the twilight of their lives after they’ve poured into their babies that we will take care of them, and then we gut social programs that would help our elders age in community with dignity and the care that they need.\\xa0 Mr. Speaker, mothers don’t need empty praise. They need policy change.\\xa0 Now by the grace of God and the sheer will and brilliance and sacrifice of my mother, my shero, Sandy Pressley, may she rest in peace and power, the woman who gave me my roots and my wings.\\xa0 There are many lessons that I was afforded by her example. Chief amongst them that being a mother was, in her opinion, her greatest achievement and her superpower. But it was also not her only identity.\\xa0 And because I had a front row seat early on to her humanity, I saw the many struggles and hardships that she was confronted with on a daily basis.\\xa0 Not for a lack of good character. Not for a lack of strong work ethic. But because of an absence of policy or of policy violence. Mr. Speaker, as a nation we penalize and marginalize the very people who give us life. But yet and still, mothers and caregivers persist — persist in doing the work of community and movement building, of mothering, of nurturing, when it’s been 101 years too long, and we have yet to even enshrine gender equality in our constitution.\\xa0 We still have not passed the Equal Rights Amendment, and still we raise our voices and we rise in the halls of power navigating systems not built for us to speak out.\\xa0 Together we press day in and day out for a more just America. Because being a mom, being a mama, being a mommy, is our superpower.\\xa0 But this is not a just nation which supports us as parents, as caregivers.\\xa0 We want this to be a just nation and one that is more just and fair for the generations we are raising, and for the generations to come.\\xa0 We fight for the rights of our children and grandchildren. We move with the clarity and conviction that only caretakers can.\\xa0 Leaving a better world behind is not an abstract concept. It is grounded in the children right in front of us.\\xa0 Every society owes a debt of gratitude to those who mother and in their name we press for a world that lives up to their aspirations.\\xa0 A world that keeps their babies safe.

       " '502 Cannon HOB, Washington, DC 20515Email Me(202) 225-6435 In 2014, President Obama famously said, “I’ve got a pen and I’ve got a phone,” telling the American people he didn’t care whether Congress had provided legislative authority for his favored policies—he would go it alone whenever he felt like it. Ten years later, Obama’s then-Vice President, now-President Joe Biden has been ruling in the same fashion daily. President Biden’s executive actions don’t just ignore congressional intent; they are expensive, unwise, and unworkable. A recent report by the House Budget Committee showed President Biden’s executive actions have totaled over $2 trillion in added cost to taxpayers, all without congressional approval. From backwards economic policies to rules restricting consumer choice on everything down to gas stoves and dishwashers, the Biden administration seems intent on trading commonsense for a pricey, overbearing agenda. Among the most shortsighted are crushing energy industry mandates, another scheme to “forgive” student loans on the backs of taxpayers, and an effort which would increase pressure on nursing homes struggling to fill staffing vacancies. According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, Biden’s latest attempt to transfer student debt onto taxpayers will cost up to $1.4 trillion. Rather than putting a trillion-dollar band-aid on broken aspects of our higher education system, we should be asking hard questions about the effectiveness of universities to educate and prepare students for the workforce even as they leverage their own non-profit tax status to accrue enormous endowments all while tuition costs rise. As a cosponsor of the Student Loan Accountability Act, a bill to prohibit the mass cancellation of student loans, I am working to hold both universities and the Biden administration accountable. As our workforce shortage impacts many corners of the economy, the Biden administration also recently finalized one-size-fits-all staffing rules for long-term care facilities which 80 percent of nursing homes would not be able to comply with, according to analysis by KFF. With the extreme workforce challenges facing rural areas, arbitrary staffing mandates for long-term care facilities are sure to put more Third District communities at risk of not having access to a local facility at all. On top of this, according to the House Budget Committee, implementing this rule will cost taxpayers $17 billion. Knowing the growing problem of long-term facility closures, I have worked hard to cut red tape for nursing homes, and I am a cosponsor of the Protecting America’s Seniors’ Access to Care Act (H.R. 7513) which would block this mandate’s implementation. We voted to move this bill out of the Ways and Means Committee in March. Earlier this month, the President continued his war on American energy as the EPA handed down rules impacting fossil fuel power plants. Nearly half of Nebraska’s electricity comes from coal, and restricting affordable energy production is a one-way ticket to exorbitant costs for consumers and undermining grid reliability. At the same time, the Biden administration is making it harder for American biofuels producers to participate in the tax credit for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Even though language in the bill creating the tax credit was intentionally written to ensure American-produced biofuels could qualify for the SAF credit, the Treasury announced nonsensical new rules which demonstrate an ignorance of how sustainability practices utilized by our producers work and the supply chain through which feedstocks like corn get from the field to the refinery. With the threat of increased dependence on foreign SAF imports, we should be striving to level the playing field for our farmers, not stunting domestic biofuel supply for SAF use. Unfortunately, the unworkable policies of the Biden administration do not reflect full consideration of the impact on hard-working American families and producers battling the cost of inflation. Through legislation to strengthen our workforce, protect consumer choice from President Biden’s product bans, and embrace all-of-the-above energy flexibility, House Republicans are fighting back against the Biden administration’s counterproductive agenda. ###',\n",

Bob Latta May 9, 2024 \\xa0 \"The Biden administration has once again demonstrated it is more interested in appeasing radical environmental activists than supporting American jobs and securing North American energy independence.\\xa0 \\xa0 \"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) officially announced last month a stringent new rule that would effectively force power plants to shut down if they don’t implement expensive new carbon capture technology by the year 2032. This out-of-touch rule is neither technologically nor economically feasible.\\xa0 \\xa0 \"And while we shouldn’t turn our back on implementing common sense carbon capture technology to help lower emissions, we simply cannot force a transition overnight. The EPA’s decision will end up hurting our energy industries, cutting jobs, and forcing consumers to fork over even more of their hard-earned dollars to heat and light their homes... \\xa0 \"...In Congress, we’re already working to overturn this misguided decision. I’m proud to join my colleague on the Energy and Commerce Committee and fellow Ohioan, Rep. Troy Balderson, in cosponsoring his Congressional Review Act. If enacted, this bill would reverse the EPA’s overreaching rule and ensure power plants can remain operational for years to come.\\xa0 \\xa0 And as we look to continue pushing back on these rules and regulations flying out of the Biden administration, the House Energy and Commerce Committee has a unique role to play. As a senior member of the committee, I’ll continue working with my colleagues to advance policies that invest in an all-of-the-above energy strategy where the federal government doesn’t pick winners and losers — one that isn’t out-of-touch with the basic realities of energy production and consumption in this country.\" \\xa0 ###',\n",
       " 'It has been roughly four and a half years since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and I am determined that Congress needs to be fully informed on U.S. government funding of risky research projects, such as the research done at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), in order to make sure the same mistakes don’t happen again. During the 118th Congress, I’ve signed letters pressing the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for information and documents pertaining to risky research projects and biosecurity practices past and present, which would obviously include data concerning the origins of COVID-19. As Chair of the Energy & Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight & Investigations, I held a hearing in 2023 to review biosafety and risk research. Also, I have participated in closed-door transcribed interviews with Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Dr. Francis Collins of NIH and EcoHealth Alliance President, Dr. Peter Daszak. Daszak was a leading collaborative figure in applying for NIH grants, and was responsible for providing progress reports on EcoHealth’s research. EcoHealth is the company that received grants from NIAID which in turn gave subgrants to WIV to conduct research on Coronavirus evolution and transmission.  At a November 2023 deposition, I asked Daszak about EcoHealth’s very late year-five progress report due to be filed in September of 2019. He said he “tried” to submit the progress report on time but could not get the NIH system to work.  Recall that evidence indicates the virus broke out in November or December of 2019 in China.  The missing report would not be submitted until August of 2021. During Daszak’s November interview, after I asked him specific questions about the report and if there were any changes, he told me first there was no change, then no “significant” change between the September 2019 version he tried to submit and the August 2021 submission. After the transcribed interview, a whistleblower gave us a draft of the progress report, dated May of 2020, where EcoHealth stated that bat coronavirus spillover was a rare event in South China and Southeast Asia. However, in their August 2021 official submission of the year-five progress report, despite supposedly using the exact same data as the initial draft, EcoHealth stated that the viral transference of coronaviruses from bats to humans could affect as many as one million people in South China and Southeast Asia. To me the difference between ‘very rare’ and a ‘million’ people is a significant difference. But during the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic hearing on May 1, I asked Daszak why the change between May 2020 and August 2021. Did he have conversations with Fauci or his colleagues at NIAID? Was he pressured by outside sources? Or did they make the changes to hide potential EcoHealth liability? He claimed the science changed! But that’s not what he told me in November of 2023. And I gave him several chances. Daszak clearly did not tell the truth. He lied to me and Congress in November! There must be some reason why. A report from the Select Subcommittee recommends formal debarment of and a criminal investigation into EcoHealth and Daszak.  Unfortunately, I believe this is unlikely to happen under a Biden Department of Justice. We should let a jury of American people decide if there is a substantial difference between a ‘very rare’ occurrence and as many as one ‘million’ people coming down with a virus. But the guy who Fauci and NIAID entrusted with our taxpayer dollars claims there is no substantial difference. Further, EcoHealth did not obtain required logbooks from WIV. We will never be able to eliminate all doubt there was a lab leak at WIV because Wuhan didn’t submit crucial data to EcoHealth as required. Moreover, EcoHealth didn’t insist Wuhan provide them with the data as contractually required. And can we even trust the data we actually got?  It comes down to whether you believe ‘very rare’ or a ‘million’ cases a year are substantially the same. I don’t. I do not trust information from WIV or EcoHealth. Additionally, I find it incomprehensible that NIAID continues to fund EcoHealth research. Not to alarm you, but the government is telling us right now that bird flu transference to humans is very rare.  Sound familiar? And is NIAID doing risky research on other viruses like the animal poxes? And if so, who are they collaborating with? I will continue to dig into the facts and try to make government research projects safer.

       " 'May 3, 2024  Dear Friend,  Last Friday, I attended the grand opening of the Orange Mound Library at the renovated Melrose High School for which I secured $3 million through the annual appropriations process. This week, I announced significant grants addressing our high maternal and infant mortality rates, applauded the Drug Enforcement Administration’s (DEA) move to reschedule marijuana, spoke against the rise of antisemitism and voted to condemn it, wrote to President Biden about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and Israel’s violation of U.S. law, saw progress in the House-Senate negotiations on extending Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) programs and authorities, announced substantial funding for Christ Community Health Services, viewed the “Americans and the Holocaust” exhibit at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, welcomed a new federal rule enforcing protection of walking horses, attended an event to advocate for protection of wild horses, announced $84.9 million to replace lead pipes in Tennessee, and offered a seasonal health tip.

I secured $3 million for renovating the school through the annual appropriations process, and I’m pleased that the investment is transforming the Orange Mound community. It was gratifying to see the outpouring of support for the library, which is sure to stimulate knowledge, wonder and community engagement for generations to come.  Announcing $2 Million in Healthy Start Grants  On Monday, I announced that Shelby County and Regional One will together receive $2,016,498 from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Healthy Start initiative. I submitted a letter of support for this important project, and the funding will help eliminate disparities in communities with high maternal and infant death rates. See my release on the grants here.  Applauding Plan to Reschedule Marijuana  While long overdue, I was pleased to see the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) move ahead this week on rescheduling marijuana. I have long advocated rescheduling and urged the DEA administrator in January to expedite the process after the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services made that recommendation last August. Decriminalizing marijuana possession at the federal level and making it legal in Tennessee is the right thing to do. We seem to be making incremental progress.  Condemning the Rise in Antisemitism  On Wednesday, I participated in the floor debate on the Antisemitism Awareness Act and then voted for the measure. In my floor remarks, I noted the unfortunate rise of antisemitism, not just on college campuses, but on the internet and elsewhere, and was reminded of then-President Trump’s exasperating response to the antisemitic and deadly demonstrations in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. See my floor speech here.  Expressing Concern about the Humanitarian Situation in Gaza On Thursday, I joined my Congressional colleagues in a letter to President Biden expressing our concerns about the humanitarian situation in Gaza and suggesting that there is sufficient evidence that Israel’s restrictions on U.S.-backed humanitarian aid violate American law. The letter reads in part: “We…urge you to make clear to Prime Minister Netanyahu that so long as Israel restricts, directly or indirectly, the facilitation of humanitarian aid delivery into Gaza, the Israeli government is risking its eligibility for further offensive security assistance from the U.S.” See the text of the entire letter here.  Seeing Progress Toward an FAA Reauthorization Bill  The House and Senate appear to be converging on a compromise that will extend the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) programs and authorities for another five years. As the Ranking Member of the Aviation Subcommittee, I was particularly pleased to see several measures I have proposed made a part of the legislation, including a review of airline seat sizes and cramped conditions on airplanes for safe emergency evacuations and several consumer protection measures. I hope to be able to vote on the bill later this month.  Announcing $3.3 Million Grant to Christ Community Health Services On Wednesday, I announced that Christ Community Health Services will receive $3,354,327 for its ongoing work with the underserved in our community. I took the opportunity to call again for the expansion of Tennessee’s Medicaid program, TennCare. See my release here.  Visiting “Americans and the Holocaust” Exhibit  On Wednesday, I joined a group of Congressional colleagues to view the new “Americans and the Holocaust” exhibit at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. The exhibit attempts to answer the questions “What did the U.S. government and the American people know about the threats to the Jewish people posed by Nazi Germany? What responses were possible? And when?” The museum provides a sad and sobering assessment. Holocaust Remembrance Day this year begins at sundown on Sunday.  Welcoming Final Rule Prohibiting Horse Soring As a longtime opponent of the intentional injury to horse legs and feet called soring to create the exaggerated gait called “The Big Lick” in walking horse competitions, I applauded on Monday the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) newly strengthened horse protections. See my release and the details here.  Advocating for Protections for Wild Horses  Congressman Cohen, Diane Lane, Congresswoman Dina Titus and Director Ashley Avis On Tuesday, my friend and actress Diane Lane came to town and together we attended an event to bring awareness of the need for additional protections for wild horses and celebrating the documentary “Wild Beauty: Mustang Spirit of the West” with the film’s director Ashley Avis. The film honors the nation’s iconic wild horses that I have long advocated protecting and for which the Humane Society named me the “Humane Horseman of the Year” in 2022.  Announcing $84 Million in Lead Pipe Replacement Funding from the EPA On Thursday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced that Tennessee will be receiving $84,997,000 to identify, remove and replace lead pipes and prevent exposure to lead in drinking water in Tennessee through the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. I am the only member of the current Tennessee Congressional delegation who voted for the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and am pleased and proud that it will provide this substantial investment in identifying and replacing lead pipes and reduce exposure to lead in our drinking water. The whole state will benefit by this investment.  Applauding Extending Health Care to Dreamers Earlier today, I applauded the Biden Administration decision to publish a final rule that will expand health care for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients, also known as “Dreamers.” The decision ensures that DACA recipients can enroll in a Qualified Health Plan through the Affordable Care Act Health Insurance Marketplace or for coverage through a Basic Health Program. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) estimated the rule could lead to 100,000 previously uninsured Dreamers enrolling in health care coverage. Dreamers are our neighbors and friends, students, teachers, and people in all walks of life. Removing barriers to health care for them is the right thing to do. This rule underlines the fact that health care is a right, not a privilege, and those who have built lives and careers in the United States deserve nothing less.

Bates is best known for helping the Little Rock Nine integrate Little Rock Central High School in 1957 and for her speech at the 1963 March on Washington. The statue depicts Bates with a pen and notepad in one hand and a folded newspaper in the other, wearing an NAACP lapel pin. It was an inspiring celebration of the life of a deserving and heroic woman.  Awaiting Senate Action on FAA Reauthorization  On Wednesday, the House voted 385-24 to extend the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) programs and authorities for another week while the Senate negotiated a compromise to pass a five-year reauthorization bill. The Senate passed the five-year bill and one-week extension on Thursday night, and I look forward to voting for the updated and improved bill, which includes several consumer protection and safety provisions I authored, next week.  Announcing $15.1 Million in HUD Formula Funding for Memphis and Shelby County  On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) released formula funding for its major planning and development programs such as the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program. Memphis will receive $13,592,584 and Shelby County will receive $1,594,934 in the current fiscal year. See details in my release on the funding here.  Introducing the DOT Victim and Survivor Advocate Act On Friday, I introduced the DOT Victim and Survivor Advocate Act to create an ombudsman-like position for traffic accident victims at the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). Traffic accident victims and their families deserve an advocate in DOT listening to their ideas for improving roadway safety, especially after suffering from a traffic crash. The DOT Victim and Survivor Advocate Act will help ensure that victim-advocates have a point of contact to work with at DOT and give them a more permanent voice in DOT decision-making.\\xa0 I am pleased to partner with Senator Ben Ray Lujan on this important legislation.  Congratulating Vladimir Kara-Murza on Winning the Pulitzer Prize  As the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Parliamentary Assembly’s Special Representative on Political Prisoners, I was delighted to see my friend Vladimir Kara-Murza awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary on Monday. Vladimir continues to write about Putin, his oligarchs, and the war in Ukraine from his prison cell in Russia. I released a congratulatory statement and again demanded his immediate release.  Fighting Juvenile Crime in Covington  On Thursday evening, I went to the Boys and Girls Club of the Hatchie River Region in Covington to discuss the $100,000 I secured for the Covington Police Department to support a youth crime and violence diversion project in partnership with the Boys and Girls Club.\\xa0 I also mentioned the $202,000 I secured for renovating the Boys and Girls Club building. The funding will be used to support a monthly series of crime reducing programs taught by Covington Police officers. This will help build strong relationships with youth and law enforcement, which is critical to empowering safe communities.  Meeting with Shelby and Tipton County REALTORS  On Tuesday, I met with a group of Tipton and Shelby County real estate agents led by Frances Anderson of Crye-Leike to discuss their priorities. Those include having the VA allow veterans using VA home loans to compensate their agents, housing affordability issues, and the More Homes on the Market Act. I always value my time discussing these kinds of issues with constituents.  Announcing $1.2 Million HIV/AIDS Grant  I announced Tuesday that the Shelby County Health Department will receive $1,285,200 for its Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program supporting the thousands with HIV in our community.  Applauding Namazzi Hampton for winning the Congressional Art Competition  This week, I chose Namazzi Hampton’s colored pencil drawing “In the Paint” as this year’s winner of the Congressional Art Competition for Tennessee’s 9th Congressional District. Ms. Hampton goes to East High School in Memphis. The drawing depicts Ja Morant in his Ja 1 Christmas sneakers. Congratulations, Ms. Hampton.

       " \"Each year, Public Service Recognition Week (PSRW) honors the contributions of public servants at the local, state, and federal level tracing back to 1985. As we embark on this year’s Public Service Week, it’s an honor to spotlight the dedicated individuals who tirelessly serve our communities. With over 20 million Americans engaged in public service nationwide, part of that 20 million is working right here in our district as first responders, in public safety, and public transportation. It doesn’t stop there, you are our teachers inspiring our youth, healthcare workers healing the sick, and firefighters protecting our homes. Your impact spreads far and wide across our beautiful state. For me, a career dedicated to public service has given me the opportunity to support each one of you everyday day. From hearing and advocating for your community concerns you bring to the table as a constituent, to celebrating the successes of our local schools, businesses, and organizations; working in public service is a profound privilege. I have immense gratitude for the dedication, professionalism, and sacrifices each of you make. While working in public service comes with its many benefits, we need to take a moment to recognize some of the core challenges. From navigating bureaucratic red tape and limited resources, public servants often face heavy workloads, tight deadlines, and the constant struggle to balance competing priorities. They address complex issues such as poverty, healthcare, and infrastructure requiring collaboration across multiple stakeholders, while overcoming resistance to change within organizations. Emergency responders must be prepared to manage crises swiftly and effectively, amidst the unpredictable nature of emergencies and disasters. Despite these obstacles, you have remained dedicated to serving our communities and finding innovative solutions to the most pressing challenges. Throughout this week, take a moment to acknowledge and celebrate the often-unsung heroes among us. Whether it’s offering a friendly wave to the postal worker, extending a heartfelt thank-you to the sanitation crew, or sharing a kind word with the librarian, every act of appreciation underscores the hard work and commitment of public servants. Public Service Week isn't solely about commemorating past achievements but also about embracing the future and passing on the torch to new graduates, aspiring public servants, and our youth. We all play a role in fostering stronger, more resilient communities. Whether through volunteering, advocacy, or simple acts of kindness, each of us can contribute to positive change. To all the public servants embodying the ethos of service and compassion, thank you. Your efforts profoundly impact countless lives throughout our district and within the United States and for that, we extend our eternal gratitude.

       " \"The Hill | Taylor Giorno  May 1, 2024  “Congress can, and should, do its part to create more flexibility and invest more in federal programs such as the Housing Choice Voucher, HOME, and Homelessness Assistance Grants Program, provide strong tenants protections, and reform federal regulations that hamper our local partners’ ability to increase our affordable housing supply,” [Congresswoman Nanette] Barragán said. As\\xa0President Biden\\xa0courts young voters and bucks negative perceptions of his handling of the economy, one economic issue looms large over the upcoming election: a historic lack of affordable housing. The cost of buying a house just hit\\xa0an all-time high, and even though rental prices are down slightly from their peak in 2022, Americans in red and blue districts alike are feeling the crunch.\\xa0 A\\xa0White House report\\xa0released in March found that although incomes have doubled since 2000, housing prices have tripled, meaning the housing prices rose 50 percent faster than income over the past two decades. The median home price recently hit $383,725, a record high that’s up 5.2 percent from a year ago, according to the real estate company Redfin. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has ticked back up above 7 percent as a recent run of strong inflation and economic data delays the timeline for the Federal Reserve to cut borrowing costs. The U.S. is also short nearly 4 million homes, according\\xa0to a recent study\\xa0by Up For Growth commissioned by the American Planning Association. Casey Dawkins, professor of urban studies and planning at the University of Maryland, identified two culprits of high housing prices that date back several presidential administrations. “New housing production fell dramatically during the foreclosure crisis of 2007-2010 and has not since recovered. Several factors account for this, including rising construction costs due to supply-chain disruptions and local land use regulations that increase the time, cost, and uncertainty associated with obtaining a development permit,” Dawkins wrote. “With rising income inequality, there are more people today earning incomes below what is necessary to afford an adequate home.” In this housing market, it’s no surprise that the lack of affordable housing is weighing on the minds of voters. Just more than 53 percent of homeowners and renters say housing affordability will impact who they vote for in the upcoming presidential election,\\xa0according to a report\\xa0by Redfin released in March. “I think that just goes to show that [housing affordability] is weighing on people’s perception of who they want to vote for,” Daryl Fairweather, Redfin’s chief economist, told The Hill. Biden is battling negative perceptions on his handling of the economy as he gears up for a rematch against former President Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee. Just 34 percent of voters approve of how Biden has handled the economy while 29 percent approve of how he has handled inflation, according to\\xa0a recent CNN poll, which also found Trump has a 6-point lead over the incumbent. Shelter costs are a key sticking point for persistent inflation, which was up 3.5 percent in March from a year ago, according to the most recent data released by the Labor Department. Shelter costs, which were up 5.7 percent from a year ago, accounted for 60 percent of the total annual increase and were “the largest factor in the monthly increase in the index for all items less food and energy.” High interest rates, which the Federal Reserve hiked to a 22-year high last summer, have also pushed up borrowing costs. The central bank is not expected to cut rates Wednesday and has signaled it is delaying its timeline to cut rates, meaning the cost of buying a house will likely remain elevated longer than initially expected. The president dedicated precious time during this year’s State of the Union address to tout his administration’s efforts to make housing more affordable, “reflective of the fact that they recognize there’s growing public angst about affordability and Washington is still struggling with what to do about it,” said Jeb Mason, a partner at Mindset and a former Treasury Department official during former President George W. Bush’s administration. Biden’s budget proposal for next year, which was dead on arrival in the Republican-controlled House, included several provisions aimed at bringing down housing costs such as expanding the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, creating a New Neighborhood Homes Tax Credit, and grants to incentivize states, local governments and tribes to build more homes.\\xa0 The president also asked Congress to pass provisions directly targeting first-time homebuyers, including a Mortgage Relief Credit and funding for a down payment assistance program. Congress is considering a number of measures to alleviate high housing prices that are weighing on their districts. While some lawmakers have taken partisan swipes across the aisle during recent hearings on housing affordability, there are several bipartisan proposals this Congress. Such measures include Sens. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) and Mike Rounds’s (R-S.D.) Rural Housing Service Reform Act; Reps. Darin LaHood (R-Ill.) and Suzan DelBene’s (D-Wash.) and Sens. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) and Todd Young’s (R-Ind.) Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act; and Reps. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.) and Brian Higgins’s (D-N.Y.) and Sens. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and Young’s Neighborhood Homes Investment Act. Mason, who advises companies, policymakers and other stakeholders on housing and financial regulation issues, said “there is a bipartisan appetite to do something, I think the question is just what can realistically get done in an election year before people kind of get into full campaign mode.” Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-Calif.), who chairs the Congressional Renters Caucus, told The Hill he hears “often from people who are frustrated.” Gomez represents part of Los Angeles, which Redfin found to have the highest median housing price and the HUD report found to have the second-highest homeless population after New York City.\\xa0 “Homeownership is core to the American Dream, but it’s out of reach for so many Americans who are forced to rent instead,” said Gomez, who is working to significantly increase federal funding for rental assistance in the new government spending package. “Maintaining current federal levels is entirely inadequate and fails to meet the scope of the current housing crisis,” he said. Gomez also recently proposed new monthly tax credits specifically for middle-class renters “to help close the gap between income and rent, with tax credits that put money directly into the pockets of working people.” But Fairweather said that “a lot of the stuff that seems comprehensive like homebuyer credits, down payment assistance, those kinds of things, don’t solve the problem either.” “Really we have to solve supply problems,” she said. Angela Brooks, president of the American Planning Association, the membership organization for planning professionals such as urban planners, told The Hill that increasing the housing supply “is a national challenge, and it demands a national response.” “In many cases, localities are hamstrung by the local opponents afraid of change. And while housing action is a priority across many states, they’re not moving fast enough in the way we need to alleviate supply challenges. That’s where federal partners can play a big role. Housing supply and zoning reform is one of the few issues in Congress gaining bipartisan traction right now,” Brooks said. Rep. Nanette Diaz Barragán (D-Calif.), who co-chairs the Congressional Caucus on Homelessness and also represents parts of Los Angeles, told The Hill that “congressional action is needed to deliver the critical investments and protections to our communities that will provide more affordable housing and keep families housed.” State and local governments have been struggling to manage the increasing number of homeless individuals in their communities. More than 653,000 people were experiencing homelessness last year, an\\xa0all-time high\\xa0as a result of rising housing prices and the end of pandemic-era assistance, according to a report released in December by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). “Congress can, and should, do its part to create more flexibility and invest more in federal programs such as the Housing Choice Voucher, HOME, and Homelessness Assistance Grants Program, provide strong tenants protections, and reform federal regulations that hamper our local partners’ ability to increase our affordable housing supply,” Barragán said. But some cities and states have turned to more punitive measures, including fines and arrest, and the Supreme Court last week heard a controversial case that could strengthen their authority to enforce anti-vagrancy and anti-encampment laws. Dawkins was doubtful that cracking down on the homeless population will solve the nation’s housing crisis. “Penalizing unhoused people for sleeping in public spaces will do nothing to alleviate the national homelessness problem; it will only change the geography of the problem by forcing those without shelter to relocate to other communities,” Dawkins said. “To get more people into homes, we need to build more housing.” Stay up-to-date on District 44's latest news, updates and more! \\nWashington D.C.

       " 'May 9, 2024 For Immediate Release Contact: Taylor Haulsee \\xa0 \\xa0 WASHINGTON\\xa0—\\xa0Yesterday, Speaker Johnson, joined by Congressional leadership, the Arkansas delegation, and Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders, hosted an unveiling ceremony for a new statue in the National Statuary Hall Collection. The statue, depicting Mrs. Daisy Lee Gatson Bates, will be displayed in Statuary Hall for decades to come. Mrs. Bates was a civil rights activist who mentored and protected the Little Rock Nine as they integrated Central High School in 1957. Read more about Mrs. Bates here. \\xa0 Watch the Speaker’s remarks here \\xa0 Read Speaker Johnson’s remarks below: \\xa0 Well, we assured you this would be a great event and you’ve heard some great comments. I want to thank everyone again for being here today. I feel right at home. I’m from Shreveport, Louisiana, and I live in Benton, which is the far northwest corner of the state. And because of that as sometimes accused by the other members of the Louisiana delegation of being a South Arkansan, and I’m okay with that. I’m okay with it. It’s fine. Great people.  \\xa0 I just want to say very quickly to the HBCU alumni choir. We’ve been in a lot of ceremonies here, Hakeem, I don’t know if anybody’s ever made the acoustics of this hall sound that good. We were just about to have church in here, okay? \\xa0 \\xa0 I want to give a special thanks to the Arkansas State Committee, Governor Sanders, Former Governor Hutchinson, and the Daisy Bates Home Museum Foundation Board for going through this lengthy process in making today possible, finally possible.  \\xa0 And of course, we want to thank Benjamin Victor. He is the sculptor of this magnificent statute.\\nIn case you didn’t know that, this is his fourth statue here in Statuary Hall. And I, that may be a record, I’m not sure, but it’s amazing. We’re really grateful for his artistic contributions.  \\xa0 And I know most of you haven’t been able to see the statue up close yet. But when you do, you’ll, you’ll admire a lot of things about it. One of the things I like, I noticed right off the the bat is you’ll notice a lot of the great citizens who are memorialized here have a grimace on their face. She’s got a big, beautiful smile. And you know what that is? That’s the facial expression of someone who is an overcomer. That’s what that says to me. That’s right. Mrs. Bates was many things, and she did many things to move our country forward. And what another thing you’ll notice, we noticed earlier, is that the heel of her right shoe is lifted off the ground. And that’s to, I think, to symbolize she’s continuing. She, she advanced that move forward for the country. That’s something that’s really remarkable as well. Of course, she was a, certainly a storyteller and she was a, a journalist. And in the statue, you’ll also see her holding a copy of the Arkansas States press, and that’s the, the statewide paper that we’ve heard she created to tell the stories of Black Americans. Now by joining Statuary Hall, Mrs. Bates is now joining the Storybook of America. And as you know, that story begins with our nation’s birth certificate, the Declaration of Independence.  \\xa0 GK Chesterson was the famous British philosopher and statesman, and he said one time, famously, America is the only nation in the world that is founded upon a creed. And he said, the creed is listed with almost theological lucidity or clarity in the Declaration of Independence. We all know the creed well. We hold these truths to be self-evident.  \\xa0 When I’m talking to young people, students, groups, I sometimes say, wait, what is a self-evident truth? Something that’s obvious, right? We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal, and that they’re endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights. That among those the rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. There are some really important truths embedded in that creed. One of them is that we all know and believe that we are made in the image of that creator. We are made in God’s image. And because of that, it means that every single person has inestimable dignity and value. And your value is not related in any way to the color of your skin or what zip code you live in or where you went to school. Your value’s inherent ’cause it is given to you by your creator. And no one can take that away. That’s right. So, throughout her years Daisy Gatson Bates helped America realize those universal truths that are set forth in our nation’s birth certificate. And she had a way of doing that, as we’ve heard. Sometimes she pulled out a gun, Hakeem, I didn’t know that part of the story, but you know, whatever’s required. One of her biographers noted that Mrs. Bates was often criticized for being pushy or ambitious or aggressive. But I think in hindsight, we all know that back in the 1950s, some people needed some pushing, right? They needed somebody with a little bit of ambition who is willing to push everyone in the right direction– from moderate bystanders to the most prejudiced people. And I like what the assistant principal of Central High said about her one time, he said, the devil himself could not have been more ab poured by the segregationist than Daisy Bates. Indeed, Mrs. Bates endured the cross burnings on her front yard, as we heard, and the death threats flying through her window. And she, she endured that because she was dedicated to the truth, that great truth that all of us are created equal. And she was remarkably brave. And she knew that what is popular isn’t always right, and what is right isn’t always popular, but if you do the right thing, eventually it’ll all catch up. And, and she did that. And because she did that, America is a more perfect union than it was when she began. I’m especially grateful because Mrs. Bates’s leadership had effects in my home state of Louisiana. Had Mrs. Bates not helped organize the Little Rock Nine and desegregate Central High, Ruby Bridges could not have walked into the William France Elementary School in New Orleans. But because Mrs. Bates organized those nine students, Ruby and minority boys and girls of Louisiana began to be treated equally in the eyes of the law as well. I do hope that you all appreciate where Mrs. Bates is situated. This is one room over from President Eisenhower. He sent the National Guard to Central High to protect the Little Rock Nine. In that same room is Dr. King and across from Mrs. Bates is Rosa Parks. And these three spoke at the March on Washington in 1963. And at that march, they fought for the right to vote and to live freely from blatant racial animus. Today, because Mrs. Bates held fast to her dream and used her life to force us to stare at the opening words of America’s story, all three of these great Americans are now honored with greatest esteem here in our nation’s capital. It really is hallowed ground. And this is an amazing feat, and it’s one that I’m sure they never expected, but they certainly, certainly deserve. So, we want to thank you all again for coming. Thank you to everybody who made this day possible. It is a time for great celebration. It truly is. So please stick around, take photos, and and help us celebrate the great legacy of Mrs. Bates. Thank you. \\xa0 ### \\n\\nTags: \\n Tweet\\n Share\\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tH-232, The Capitol\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWashington, D.C. 20515\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t202-225-4000\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t ©2024 U.S. House of Representatives.

       " 'May 9, 2024 WASHINGTON\\xa0– Today ahead of Mother’s Day,\\xa0Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07), alongside Representatives Gwen Moore (W-04I), Lauren Underwood (IL-14), Alma Adams (NC-12) and Debbie Dingell (MI-06), and Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Bob Casey (D-PA)\\xa0announced the re-introduction of the\\xa0Mamas First Act, legislation that directly and meaningfully addresses the maternal mortality crisis by expanding Medicaid to include doula and midwifery care.\\xa0 “Maternal health justice is racial justice. While we work to confront the Black maternal morbidity crisis in America, the\\xa0Mamas First Actwould save lives by ensuring pregnancy-related care includes expansive and comprehensive health care coverage for doulas and midwifery services – including prenatal, delivery, and postpartum services,”\\xa0said Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, co-founder of the Black Maternal Health Caucus. “Comprehensive, culturally-congruent care should be a reality for all, not just some, and I am proud to reintroduce this vital legislation alongside Rep. Moore and my colleagues. Congress must pass this bill without delay.” “America’s ongoing maternal health crisis magnifies the need for federal interventions that can save lives. The Mamas First Act is an important effort because it will expand access to providers who can offer emotional and physical support during and after the birthing process – comprehensive beyond the hospital setting where nearly all U.S. births occur. Our legislation is an opportunity to empower more mothers with doulas and midwives – perinatal professionals who advocate for a mother’s needs. I am thrilled to join my amazing House and Senate maternal health champions in re-introducing this vital legislation,” saidCongresswoman Gwen Moore. “As we’re seeing today at the state level in North Carolina, Medicaid expansion continues to improve outcomes for mothers, babies, and all Americans,” said\\xa0Congresswoman Alma S. Adams, Ph.D., co-founder and co-chair of the Black Maternal Health Caucus. “That’s why I’m proud to support the reintroduction of Congresswoman Moore’s Mamas First Act. Maternal mortality remains significantly higher in the United States than in other comparable countries, especially for Black mothers. This legislation addresses the maternal mortality crisis by expanding Medicaid to include doula and midwifery care, because having trusted partners in the birthing process saves lives. Mothers are less than half of the population, but we give birth to 100% of it – Congress needs to put Mamas First because our Mamas can’t wait.” “Good care and support from a doula or midwife can make the difference between a positive and healthy pregnancy outcome, and a devastating one. Every mom should be able to access this critically important care,”\\xa0said Congresswoman Lauren Underwood, co-founder and co-chair of the Black Maternal Health Caucus..\\xa0“As Co-Founder and Co-Chair of the Black Maternal Health Caucus, I’m proud to join Congresswoman Gwen Moore to introduce the Mamas First Act, a bold step to address our country’s maternal mortality crisis by expanding Medicaid coverage to include doula and midwife care. Together, we can, and must, take decisive action to save lives and end disparities.” “The quality of care a pregnant woman receives should not depend on the color of her skin, where she lives, or her ability to pay. Each childbirth is different, and women and their doctors should be empowered to decide what care is best. By providing access to adequate and proper maternal services, including doulas and midwives, we will help end the maternal mortality crisis in our country and ensure our children start their lives out healthy and strong,”\\xa0said\\xa0Congresswoman Debbie Dingell. “The United States has a terrible track record when it comes to maternal mortality, and it’s costing women their lives,” said\\xa0Senator Elizabeth Warren. “Now is the time to use all available tools to combat the maternal health crisis, including by expanding Medicaid to cover access to doulas, midwives, and tribal midwives. The Mama’s First Act will take care of our mommas and babies and will help us root out the deep disparities and systemic racism in our health care system.” “Expanding Medicaid to include doula and midwifery care is imperative to combating the maternal mortality crisis disproportionately impacting Black and indigenous mothers,”\\xa0said Senator Cory Booker.\\xa0“Doula-assisted mothers are less likely to experience complications at birth, and midwife-led care is associated with healthier outcomes for mothers and their babies. All mothers deserve support and care throughout their pregnancy and postpartum journeys, and this legislation is a critical step toward ensuring more equitable access to quality maternal health care.” “Every mother deserves support and care before, during, and after birth,” said\\xa0Senator Bob Casey.\\xa0“This legislation will help address the maternal health crisis in this country by ensuring that Medicaid covers the full spectrum of care that mothers and infants need.” America is facing a maternal mortality crisis, with the\\xa0highest maternal mortality rate\\xa0among wealthy nations.\\xa0 According to a study conducted by the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), maternal mortality rates have\\xa0doubled between the years of 1999 and 2019 while decreasing in other similar wealthy nations.\\xa0 Black and Native mothers have maternal mortality rates that are two to three times the rate of white mothers. There is also a lack of access to maternity health care providers in communities across the country, also called maternity care deserts, impacting nearly 7 million women and nearly 500,000 births nationwide, according to the March of Dimes. The\\xa0Mamas First Act\\xa0amends the\\xa0Social Security Actto allow doulas, midwives, and tribal midwives to be reimbursed by Medicaid. The\\xa0Mamas First\\xa0Act is endorsed by: Black Mamas Matter Alliance (BMMA), March of Dimes, The Association of Maternal & Child Health Programs (AMCHP), National Birth Equity Collaborative, Common Sense Childbirth Inc., American College of Nurse Midwives (ACNM), Centers for Reproductive Rights, What to Expect Project, Futures Without Violence, Seattle Indian Health Board, African American Breastfeeding Network, Momsrising, and Ujima. “The African American Breastfeeding Network supports and fully endorses the Mammas First Act because it is essential that Wisconsin provides Medicaid reimbursement coverage so that doulas and birth workers can earn equitable pay without having to work multiple jobs,”\\xa0said\\xa0Dalvery Blackwell, Executive Director, Co-Founder of the African American Breastfeeding\\xa0Network. “Every mom deserves the respectful, responsive, nurturing and empowering care she needs to deliver a healthy beginning and a healthy future to herself and the baby she loves. Research shows that midwives and doulas deliver that care best – along with lower rates of complications, c-sections and epidurals, perinatal mood and anxiety disorders and birth trauma, higher rates of breastfeeding success…and lower healthcare costs. The Mamas First Act delivers that care where it’s needed most to the moms who need it most, by ensuring Medicaid coverage of doulas, midwives and tribal midwives. That’s why the What to Expect Project and I are proud to endorse this critical bill,”\\xa0saidHeidi Murkoff, author of What to Expect When You’re Expecting and founder of the What to Expect Project. “Across the country, African American, American Indian, and Alaskan Native mothers are dying at rates three to four times that of white mothers. In addition, we are seeing expanding maternity care deserts in cities and rural areas across the U.S. where seven million women live, and nearly 150,000 babies are being born, who have no or limited access to maternity care. Expanding access to care, by increasing access to doulas and midwives, is a key component to reversing these alarming trends.\\xa0With 42% of pregnant women utilizing Medicaid for coverage, the Mamas First Act would take a major step in the right direction in getting pregnant women the access to care they need and ensure that their infants have the best start to life possible,”\\xa0saidStacey Y. Brayboy, Sr. Vice President, Public Policy & Government Affairs. “As a Mama, OB/Gyn and the Founder and President of the National Birth Equity Collaborative, I am so excited about the opportunity we have to improve birth outcomes for all by passing the Mamas First Act in 2024. As we look for solutions to ensure Black Mamas, babies and their villages thrive, Doula support must be covered by all State Medicaid Plans,”\\xa0said\\xa0Joia Crear Perry, MD, Founder & President of the National Birth Equity Collaborative.\\xa0 “BMMA applauds the continued efforts of Representative Gwen Moore and all the co-sponsors of the Mamas First Act as it will allow for Midwifery and Doula services to be reimbursable through Medicaid. Many states, especially in the southern region of the U.S., are in significant need of high-quality, holistic, and comprehensive maternity care. Passage of the Mamas First Act can help strengthen maternity care workforce efforts,”\\xa0said\\xa0Angela D. Aina, Executive Director, Black Mamas Matter Alliance, Inc (BMMA). “Ujima celebrates Congresswoman Moore’s reintroduction of the Mama First Act and her continued fight to ensure equitable and comprehensive maternal health options for all. Doulas and Midwives not only provide expansive perinatal care, but also have proven to be a valuable asset to combat maternal mortality and morbidity. Medicaid coverage for these services removes barriers for parents, particularly the 65% of Black birthing people who rely on Medicaid for pregnancy and postpartum assistance. The Mama First Act demonstrates actionable steps toward disparate \\xa0maternal care. Ujima applauds Representative Moore, Senator Elizabeth Warren and all the co-sponsors for their commitment to holistic maternal care for women,”\\xa0said\\xa0Karma Cottman, CEO, Ujima, The National Center on Violence Against Women in the Black Community.\\xa0 As a founding member of the Black Maternal Health Caucus, Congresswoman Pressley has been a longtime champion of maternal health and reproductive justice. ### Washington DC Office 402 Cannon HOB\\r\\nWashington, DC 20515 Phone (202) 225-5111\\r\\nFax (202) 225-9322 District Office 1295 River Street\\r\\nHyde Park, MA 02136 Phone (617) 850-0040\\r\\nFax (202) 225-9322',\n",
       " \"More than 80 lawmakers sent Biden some concrete ideas as his administration considers executive actions to address U.S. border crossings. NBC News | Julie Tsirkin May 8th, 2024  WASHINGTON — Immigration advocates and Democratic lawmakers are urging President Joe Biden to prioritize long-term undocumented immigrants as his administration\\xa0weighs executive actions\\xa0to curb record crossings along the southern border. In a\\xa0letter\\xa0signed by more than 80 lawmakers, including members of the Congressional Hispanic and Progressive caucuses, the Democrats ask Biden to “take all available actions to streamline pathways to lawful status for undocumented immigrants” ahead of the November election. “Deporting all such individuals — as former President Donald Trump has threatened to do if reelected — would devastate the American economy and destroy American families,” they added. The letter offers concrete steps they say the White House could take, including streamlining the process by which DACA recipients, or immigrants brought to the country illegally as children, can seek to change to a nonimmigrant status. Lawmakers also ask Biden to unify families by allowing undocumented migrants married to U.S. citizens to seek parole on a case-by-case basis and reduce processing times for green card cases so that those migrants could be eligible to work. The chair of the Hispanic Caucus, Rep. Nanette Barragan, D-Calif., said in a statement that Biden “should seize this critical moment by exercising his Executive Authority to rebuild our broken immigration system.” “We urge him to provide pathways to citizenship and protections for the millions of long-term undocumented residents who have contributed to the rich fabric of the United States,” she said. The new push follows a\\xa0letter in March\\xa0from Senate Democrats, led by Judiciary Committee Chair Dick Durbin, of Illinois, and Immigration Subcommittee Chair Alex Padilla, of California, outlining the same call to action. ”As the Biden administration considers executive actions on immigration, we must not return to failed Trump-era policies aimed at banning asylum and moving us backwards,” Padilla told NBC News in a statement. On Monday,\\xa0NBC News reported\\xa0that Biden is considering using his executive authority in the coming weeks to potentially restrict the number of migrants who can enter the U.S.\\xa0 The administration has been in touch with immigration advocacy groups ahead of any executive order. A Department of Homeland Security official with knowledge of the discussions said the White House would most likely invoke power reserved for the president in Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows a president discretion over who is admitted into the U.S. Under that authority, Customs and Border Protection would be directed to block the entry of migrants crossing over from Mexico if daily border crossings passed a certain threshold. It’s similar to a provision of\\xa0the border bill\\xa0negotiated by a bipartisan group of senators earlier this year, which was\\xa0killed by Republicans, in part, at\\xa0Trump’s urging. Advocates are worried that the policy would be too restrictive on asylum, as are some Democrats who opposed the bill in February and called for a legal pathway to citizenship for undocumented people in the U.S. to be included in the text. Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus lobbied the administration over months to no avail, with Democratic leadership eventually giving up its long-held red line on immigration reform to unlock aid to Ukraine amid a Republican blockade. The GOP rejected the bipartisan compromise regardless, effectively sinking all near-term prospects for Congress to tackle an issue that has plagued the U.S. government for years. Nonetheless, Padilla said this is Biden’s “opportunity” to “provide relief for the long-term immigrants of this nation.” Padilla is leading a news conference Wednesday afternoon with lawmakers and advocates from FWD.us, American Families United, UnidosUS and CASA to spotlight the letter to Biden. The president of FWD.us, an immigration advocacy group, said in a statement that most Americans “don’t have the opportunity to improve the lives of hundreds of thousands of American families — but President Biden does.” ”He has the legal authority to provide affirmative relief to the spouses of U.S. citizens, and other longtime undocumented community members,” Todd Schulte said. “We hope, and believe, he will act soon to protect these American families.” Stay up-to-date on District 44's latest news, updates and more! \\nWashington D.C.

       " 'May 8, 2024 For Immediate Release Contact: Taylor Haulsee \\xa0 WASHINGTON\\xa0—\\xa0Today, Speaker Johnson, Congressman Chip Roy (TX), and Senator Mike Lee (UT) held a press conference to announce the introduction of the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act. Amid the worst border crisis in American history, the SAVE Act would ensure that onlyU.S. citizens vote in federal elections by requiring proof of citizenship to register. \\xa0 Click here to watch Speaker Johnson’s remarks \\xa0 “Some have noted that it’s already a crime for noncitizens to vote in a federal election, and that is true. But here are four things that are also true,” Speaker Johnson said. “(1) It is true that there is no mechanism to ensure only those registering or voting are actually citizens… (2) It is true that Biden has welcomed millions and millions of illegal aliens, including sophisticated criminal syndicates and agents of adversarial governments, into our borders and even on humanitarian parole… (3) It is true that a growing number of localities are blurring the lines for noncitizens by allowing them to vote in municipal elections… (4) It is true that Democrats have expressed a desire to turn non-citizens into voters.” \\xa0 The event also featured remarks from: \\xa0 Below is the transcript of Speaker Johnson’s remarks \\xa0 We are we are here this morning for a very important reason, as you all know, because there is currently an unprecedented and a clear and present danger to the integrity of our election system. And that is the threat of non-citizens and illegal aliens voting in our elections. In last five and a half months or so, I’ve been to over 101 cities doing events all around the country in more than half the states. The first or second question that I’m asked in every public forum is about election security. Americans are deeply concerned about this. And it doesn’t matter where you live or whether you’re in a blue state or a red state, everyone’s concerned. \\xa0 And due to the wide-open border that the Biden administration has refused to close – in fact that they engineered to open – we now have so many non-citizens in the country that if only one out of 100 of those voted, they would cast hundreds of thousands of votes. And since our elections are so razor thin in these days that we’re in, just a few precincts in a few states decide the makeup of Congress and who is elected to the White House. This is a dangerously high number, and it’s a great concern to millions and millions of Americans. It could obviously change the outcome of our elections, and this is not an empty threat or concern. \\xa0 I’ll let my colleague Chip Roy here in a moment get into the specifics of the SAVE Act, but I want to address why we need this legislation. Some have noted that it’s already a crime for non-citizens to vote in a federal election and that is true. But here are four things that are also true. Number one, it’s true that no current mechanism to ensure only those registering or voting are actually citizens. There’s no mechanism that exist to make sure that that’s correct. If a nefarious actor wants to intervene in our elections, all they have to do is check a box on a form and sign their name. That’s it. That’s all that’s required. And there’s a very small chance that illegal would get caught. Because here’s the other thing: our states do not have the election infrastructure in place to confirm what they’ve said. Number two. It’s true that Joe Biden has welcomed millions and millions of illegal aliens. We think the number I believe the number is close to probably at this point 16 million illegals who have come into this country since Joe Biden walked into the Oval Office. That includes sophisticated criminal syndicates and agents of adversarial governments, here in our borders and even on humanitarian parole. \\xa0 And that means the millions that had been paroled can simply go to their local welfare office or the DMV and register to vote there. And please understand this, states are currently prohibited from asking someone to prove that they’re a citizen when they use the federal voter registration form. Third truth it is also true that a growing number of localities are blurring the lines for non-citizens by allowing them to vote in municipal local elections. In cities and towns in California and Maryland, Vermont, and even right here in DC. You might not know this, but non-citizens are voting. Number four: it’s true that Democrats have expressed a desire to turn on citizens and voters. That’s what this open border has been all about. \\xa0 Former Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler admitted that to me, expressly stated to me in a committee hearing in a in a video that’s gone viral, just last year, a year and a half ago. Stacey Abrams said it in 2018 on the campaign trail. In their rare moments of candor, they will tell you the truth that this is something they are for. Two months ago, every Senate Democrat voted to count illegal aliens in the census to help them shore up more seats in Congress and more votes in the Electoral College. And this week, House Democrats will also have an opportunity to go on record on the same issue. \\xa0 In recent days, we’ve seen a growing number of folks on student visas show their willingness to break the law and utterly disrupt our way of life and threatened law-abiding students who are actually American citizens. If they’re willing to take over buildings and physically terrorize their fellow students, why would they not be willing to lie on a voter registration form? \\xa0 It’s clear that our election process is worth protecting. It is our responsibility as members of Congress and concerned leaders of citizens groups and organizations who care about the integrity of our system and our elections. It is our duty to ensure that this is done. Even if you weren’t concerned about the drop boxes and the ballot harvesting and the mail in ballots and 2020, you definitely should be concerned that illegal aliens might be voting in 2024. And that’s why it is critical that we pass the SAVE act to safeguard our federal elections and ensure that only Americans get to decide American elections. \\xa0 ### \\n\\nTags: \\n Tweet\\n Share\\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tH-232, The Capitol\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWashington, D.C. 20515\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t202-225-4000\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t ©2024 U.S. House of Representatives.

       " 'May 8, 2024 Contact:\\xa0Taylor Haulsee \\xa0 \\xa0 WASHINGTON\\xa0—\\xa0Today, Speaker Johnson and Leader McConnell sent a letter to President Biden urging that congressionally appropriated security assistance to Israel should be expedited immediately. \\xa0 The letter demands answers from the Biden Administration as to why the Administration had delayed the delivery of a variety of weapons shipments bound for Israel. \\xa0 Full text of the letter: \\xa0 Dear Mr. President: \\xa0 Having recently worked on a bipartisan basis to pass an emergency national security supplemental appropriations bill that included urgent assistance to Israel, we were alarmed by media reports that your Administration had delayed the delivery of a variety of weapons shipments bound for Israel. This news flies in the face of assurances provided regarding the timely delivery of security assistance to Israel. \\xa0 While we appreciate recent clarifications that assistance funded by the supplemental appropriations bill will not be impacted, we believe that security assistance to Israel is an urgent priority that must not be delayed. These recent press reports and pauses in critical weapons shipments call into question your pledge that your commitment to Israel’s security will remain ironclad. Despite regular engagement on security assistance to Israel, and repeated assurances from the most senior officials over the past several months, it was only after public press reports and subsequent engagement by our offices that we learned from your staff that “a review of a specific weapons shipment” was underway. The American public deserves to understand the nature, timing, and scope of these reviews. \\xa0 Additionally, we have not been able to obtain pertinent information from the Department of State or from the Department of Defense regarding the ongoing review. Israel faces an existential and multi-front threat as recently demonstrated by the direct attack by Iran and Iranian-backed terrorists, and daylight between the United States and Israel at this dangerous time risks emboldening Israel’s enemies and undermining the trust that other allies and partners have in the United States. \\xa0 We believe security assistance to Israel, Ukraine, and vulnerable partners in the Indo-Pacific should be expedited to the fullest extent possible. We expect your Administration will push departments, agencies, and industry to expedite contracting, production, and delivery of weapons and munitions critical to the defense of the United States and the free world in accordance with Congressional intent. We ask that you provide relevant responses by the end of the week on the timing of this “review,” if any other shipments will be similarly paused, what office is responsible for conducting the review(s), and most importantly when the review is anticipated to end to allow this vital assistance to move forward. \\xa0 Sincerely, \\xa0 Mike Johnson Speaker of the House\\xa0 \\xa0 Mitch McConnell Senate Republican Leader \\xa0 ### \\n\\nTags: \\n Tweet\\n Share\\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tH-232, The Capitol\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWashington, D.C. 20515\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t202-225-4000\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t ©2024 U.S. House of Representatives.

There are a lot of things to fix.  \\xa0 Last week, we announced a House-wide effort to crackdown on antisemitism on campus This morning, we introduced legislation to fortify American elections and ensure that only American citizens can vote.  \\xa0 I am glad this distraction will not inhibit that important work and all the other things on the table and on the agenda for us right now.  \\xa0 Hopefully, this is the end of the personality politics and the frivolous character assassination that has defined the 118th Congress. It’s regrettable and it’s not who we are as Americans. We’re better than this. We need to get beyond it.  \\xa0 The Speaker of the House serves the whole House, that’s the job. But I am a lifelong, movement conservative Republican and I intend to continue to govern in accordance with those core principles. \\xa0 We believe in the core principles, I call them the 7 Core Principles of American Conservatism, but they’re also the core principles of America itself. \\xa0 I believe in individual freedom, limited government, the rule of law, peace through strength, fiscal responsibility, free markets, and human dignity.  \\xa0 Those are the guiding principles that inform our work and that we work for every day here to pursue, to ensure that all Americans have more liberty and opportunity and security.  \\xa0 And those foundations are in jeopardy right now. We need steady hands at the wheel. We need people who understand what made America the strongest, the most powerful, the most free, the most successful, and the most benevolent nation in the history of the world. \\xa0 We have to fight for that every day, because we’re in a battle between two competing visions for what America is and what it’s going to be. And that’s what I’m about every day here, and I’ll continue that.  \\xa0 We have important work, not only to keep the house majority, but to grow the majority, because that will be necessary to help save this country. And the work that we have to elect a Republican president, we’re on that as well.  \\xa0 In this moment, the country desperately needs a functioning Congress, and that’s what the overwhelming majority of the members in this body demonstrated today.  \\xa0 I’m proud to serve in this position. It’s not one that I aspired to. It’s not one that I ever expected to have or planned for, but it is the honor of my life and career to do this. And I will do it so long as this body will have me do that.  \\xa0 We have a great vision for the country. We’re not deterred. We have many problems to fix. \\xa0 And I’m going to tell you what you all have heard me say many times: I believe in the goodness of America. I believe in the future of this country. I believe, as Reagan said, as he reminded us what Lincoln originally said, we are the last best hope of man on Earth. And by God’s grace, we’ll save this country, and I’ll keep fighting every day to make sure that happens. \\xa0 ### \\n\\nTags: \\n Tweet\\n Share\\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tH-232, The Capitol\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWashington, D.C. 20515\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t202-225-4000\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t ©2024 U.S. House of Representatives.

Here’s what I have to do every day: I have to do my job; I have to do what I know to be right. We advance our conservative policies and principles as far as we can here every single day up the field, in spite of the fact that we have the smallest majority in U.S. history. We can’t get 100% of what we want. And sometimes a handful of my colleagues demand that. It’s just not possible right now, but we’re fighting. We’re going to get this job done. And I think that’s leadership. Leadership in very difficult times.” \\xa0 On Biden’s abandonment of Israel: \\xa0 “He’s defying the will of Congress and he’s defying what his own top officials in the White House assured me in writing and verbally before that supplemental was passed and even in the days since. This idea of withholding weapons to Israel as a condition of somehow, you know, Joe Biden wanting to micromanage their war effort over their, defensive effort, is catastrophic policy. It would be devastating to our closest ally in the region, and it would go directly against the will of what the members of this body voted on just several days ago, so they have got to answer the American people in answer to us and we’re on that right now.” \\xa0 On news reports Biden is considering executive action at the border: \\xa0 “It’s window dressing. He could use section 212F of the Immigration and Nationality Act today and close the border entirely. He knows he has that authority, I even read it to President Biden myself. First, he refused to accept that it was actually the law, which is nonsense. And then he refused to use it. If he really wanted to close the border he would reinstate remain in Mexico. That’s what the border patrol says would reduce the flow by 70%.” \\xa0 ### \\n\\nTags: \\n Tweet\\n Share\\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tH-232, The Capitol\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWashington, D.C. 20515\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t202-225-4000\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t ©2024 U.S. House of Representatives.

       " 'May 9, 2024 For Immediate Release Contact: Taylor Haulsee \\xa0 WASHINGTON\\xa0—\\xa0This morning, Speaker Johnson joined Squawk Box to discuss President Biden abandoning Israel, antisemitism on college campuses, and the SAVE Act: \\xa0 Click here to watch to the full interview \\xa0 On President Biden abandoning Israel: \\xa0 “What the President is doing here is not only defying the will of Congress, to your point, we just voted on this several days ago. But he’s also trying to dictate, I guess, and micromanage the war, the defense effort in Israel, as a condition of supplying the weapons that we all know that they desperately need. I spoke with Prime Minister Netanyahu myself less than 48 hours ago about this situation, because I wanted to hear it directly from him. And what they’re withholding is precision weapons that are desperately needed. Here’s another irony: the precision weapons are needed to try to protect civilian lives and Rafah. These are the things that they need to do to do the job that must be done to eradicate the threat of Hamas who is still lurking there. And so, for Joe Biden to do this, he is he is going against what he told Congress, what his top officials in the White House specifically told me that they would do, and it’s just catastrophic policy. \\xa0 “I believe it’s 100% a political calculation. I think we can all see that. It’s the same reason that he’s making the political calculation not to call out antisemitism on the campuses, not to call out and speak without equivocation about the good versus evil here, the right versus the wrong. I mean, he has the largest bully pulpit in America. He’s the Commander in Chief, he’s the top elected official in our country. We desperately need him to look right into the camera and say, to speak with moral clarity to say what is right and what is wrong, and he is unable and unwilling to do that because he doesn’t want to offend a big segment of his base now, his party. There’s an actual pro-Hamas, pro-Palestinian wing of the Democratic Party.” \\xa0 On antisemitism on college campuses: \\xa0 “As you know, last week, we launched the whole of the House, whole of Congress effort. We have six committees of jurisdiction, everything from Ways and Means to the Science, Space and Technology Committee, that are looking at every angle of that. We are deeply concerned about this idea that the Ivy League and these other universities receive billions of dollars of taxpayer funds every year. This is the precious treasure of American taxpayers, and they don’t deserve it if they can’t uphold the basic constitutional rights and the security and safety of their students. And some of them were unwilling to do that. They have demonstrated that. \\xa0 “They are kowtowing to the violent protest, and they are ignoring the rights and the civil rights of their students who pay tuition and deserve and have the freedom and the right to go to class unimpeded and unafraid. And so that’s the problem. So, Congress is looking at that, we’re looking at the funding streams, we’re looking at the generous tax benefits that their endowments enjoy, these big universities. And these foreign student visas. If you come over here and you’re an aspiring terrorist, you don’t deserve to be on an American campus. You don’t deserve to be there threatening your Jewish classmates and peers just because of who they are, and we’ve got to get down to the bottom of that. I think there’s a big appetite on both sides of the aisle here to address that. And I think that’s something the American people will stand and applaud.” \\xa0 On the SAVE Act: \\xa0 “I mean, this sounds like a conspiracy theory, but it’s the only theory that makes sense, that Joe Biden and Mayorkas engineered the wide-open border. They’ve allowed, by our count and my estimate is about 16 million illegals since Joe Biden walked into the Oval Office three and a half years ago. And they did this because they ultimately, some in that party and some who engineered this, wanted to turn them into voters and they wanted to affect the outcome of the next census by spreading them around the country. We’re going to work on both of those issues. But that first one is right. It is a violation of federal law right now, it’s against statutory law for an illegal to vote in an election and in a federal election. But there’s no way for the states to ask someone if they check the box and say I’m a citizen, when they do the motor voter registration, if that’s actually true. There’s no mechanism to prove it, believe it or not. And so, we’re going to fix that, we’re bringing a bill, The SAVE Act that will solve that problem. I think it’s common sense. \\xa0 “…It will be stunning if [Democrats] vote against that, some will, but they’ll have to explain why they’re opposing existing federal law and why they want illegals to vote in US elections. Good luck with that one. They can’t say the quiet part out loud. We’re about to find out. 76% of the American people understand that’s a priority and by some polls 86% of the American people want only US citizens to vote in US elections. What a concept, right? We’re trying to advance common sense here. We certainly hope that everybody gets on board with that.” \\xa0 ### \\n\\nTags: \\n Tweet\\n Share\\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tH-232, The Capitol\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWashington, D.C. 20515\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t202-225-4000\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t ©2024 U.S. House of Representatives.

       " 'FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE |\\xa0Contact: Olivia Porcaro 202-225-6165 Over the past few months, we have watched violent, antisemitic, un-American, and pro-terrorist mobs take over college campuses across the country, endangering Jewish students and other innocent bystanders. Yet, for months, many Democrats have refused to speak out against the protests.  Sadly, this is no surprise. Antisemitism is a disease that the Far-Left, along with liberal university leaders, has allowed to spread.  In fact, over the past year, we have watched Democrats spread anti-Israel rhetoric time and time again. Some have called for Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to be replaced, one said it was an “honor” to visit with the pro-Hamas protestors at Columbia University, one defended the phrase “from the river to the sea”, which implies the destruction of Israel, one denounced Israel as a “racist state,” and more.  In addition, Far-Left Democrats in the House of Representatives have repeatedly voted against legislation supporting Israel. Back in October, immediately following Hamas’ barbaric October 7th attack on Israel, nine Democrats voted against a resolution to stand with Israel as it defended itself from the terrorist group. Then, again, just a few weeks ago, thirteen Democrats voted against condemning Iran’s missile attack on Israel.  The recent actions of the Democrats with respect to Israel are both outrageous and inappropriate. They truly seem to have lost all sense of moral and political clarity and have made it very clear - the Far-Left has a serious anti-Israel problem.  I couldn’t disagree with their views of Israel more.  Israel is our closest friend and ally in the Middle East, and the only democracy in the region. They are under assault by Iran, the largest state sponsor of terrorism and a deadly enemy to both Israel and the United States, and Hamas, a terrorist group who not only ruthlessly murdered over 1,200 Israelis on October 7, 2023, but also still holds over one hundred hostages, including five Americans.  These attacks on Israel are defining moments. Yet, instead of leading through strength and proving to the rest of the world that the United States remains steadfast in our commitment to Israel’s security, many Democrats have publicly criticized our democratic ally. This is both unthinkable and unprecedented, as their actions are driving a rift between the United States and its closest ally, playing into the objectives of the terrorists.   Although I have no faith that they will, I am calling on all of them, as well as the morally bankrupt university leaders who are allowing pro-terrorist protests on their campuses, to stand with our great ally, Israel, at this critical moment.   As the Leader of the Free World, we must support our allies, work together, and lead through with strength. To do anything else is a public betrayal to our friends in Israel and effectively supports an enemy to civilized people around the world. E-mail Me',\n",

       " \"May is Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) Heritage Month. I’m honored to join communities across the country in celebrating the history, immeasurable contributions, and achievements of the Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander communities.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nThis observance originally began as “Asian/Pacific American Heritage Week,” which was established through a joint Congressional resolution in 1978 and was later designated as “Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month” in section 102 of title 36, United States Code. The month of May was chosen due to two important milestones in AANHPI history: May 7, 1843, when the first Japanese immigrants arrived in the United States, and May 10, 1869, when the first transcontinental railroad was completed with substantial contributions from Chinese immigrant workers.\\n\\xa0\\nAANHPI Month is about paying tribute to the generations of Asian and Pacific Islanders who have enriched America's history and are instrumental in our future success. We must also do all we can to stop anti-Asian hate, whenever and wherever it occurs. A\\xa0new report\\xa0shows 32% of Asian Americans nationwide were called a slur over the past 12 months, and 29% were verbally harassed or abused. More than a quarter of Asian Americans say they feel unsafe on public transportation, and 41% think they will be the victim of a physical attack in the next five years.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nAwareness is key – we need to do more to keep all Americans safe from bigotry and discrimination. One of the best ways to fight ignorance and hatred is by learning about other communities and cultures.\\xa0 That’s why this month is so important. It gives us the \\xa0opportunity to learn more about our neighbors and their contributions to our country. Let’s make sure AANHPI stories are told at every level and AANHPI voices are represented – in books, media, entertainment, and in government.\\xa0 \\xa0 Are you part of the AANHPI community? How are you celebrating this month, and what do you want the public to know about your community? Click to take my survey \\n\\xa0BREAKING: Economy Update\\n\\xa0\\nThe unemployment rate has been under 4% for the longest stretch of time since the 1960s. The U.S. added 175,000 new jobs last month. This is progress – but we have more to do, we must continue to make sure these jobs pay a livable minimum wage.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nThat’s why I’m proud to support the Raise the Wage Act to increase the minimum wage to $17 an hour by 2028. Americans deserve to be fairly compensated for their hard work. Hoosiers shouldn’t have to work two or three jobs to feed their families or keep their homes.\\xa0 \\xa0 That’s why I’m also working to lower the high cost of goods and services. Democrats’ work has resulted in a cap on the price of insulin – no senior on Medicare pays more than $35 a month for this lifesaving medication, thanks to our work. I’ll keep fighting for you – the hardworking, middle-class Americans who make our country so great.\\xa0\\n\\xa0Success Story of the Week:\\xa0\\xa0\\nLast month, my office was honored to present Clifton Morlan of American Legion Post 360 with his official Korean Defense Medal.

       " 'May 8, 2024 Lawmakers Continue Calls for Extending TPS for Haiti, Halting Deportations, Disrupting Arms Trafficking, Providing Humanitarian & Economic Assistance, and More Press Conference (Twitter) | Photos (Dropbox) WASHINGTON\\xa0– Haiti Caucus Co-Chairs Congresswomen Ayanna Pressley (MA-07), Yvette D. Clarke (NY-09) and Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick (FL-20), along with Congresswoman Cori Bush (MO-01), Congresswoman Frederica Wilson (FL-24), and Congresswoman Barbara Lee (CA-13), held a Capitol Hill press conference with colleagues and advocates to renew their calls for urgent federal action to address the growing crisis in Haiti. The press conference comes at a time when the humanitarian, political, economic, and security crises in Haiti are becoming increasingly dire.\\xa0 The policies called for by the lawmakers and advocates include: extending and redesignating TPS for Haiti; halting all deportations to Haiti; disrupting arms trafficking to the island; providing urgent humanitarian relief; preventing the transfer of Haitian nationals to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; passing a new economic assistance package that creates jobs and rebuilds Haiti’s infrastructure; facilitating the establishment of a representative transitional government led by Haitian civil society; and more. “Our Haitian siblings on the island and throughout the diaspora should know that we have not forgotten them and we will never stop fighting for the just and equitable future the Haitian people need and deserve,” said Congresswoman Pressley, Co-Chair of the House Haiti Caucus. “Congress and the Biden Administration have a moral obligation to take action to stabilize Haiti and to save lives, including by providing humanitarian and economic assistance, extending TPS for Haiti, halting deportations, supporting a democratic transition led by Haitian civil society, and more. If we truly believe Black lives matter, then that must include Haitian lives.” “Our nation owes a debt to Haiti. Repayment begins by helping ensure that a Haitian-led democracy rings true in their communities, in the United States, and across the globe. We must take every action necessary to secure a democratic transition led by Haiti’s civil society, and that includes providing vital humanitarian and economic aid, expediting visa processing, cracking down on illegal arms trafficking, and extending TPS and halting deportations. Congress has a responsibility to support Haitian stability and the safety of all its people, and it holds the power to deliver the progress our Haitian neighbors at home and abroad are counting on. In this dire moment where the future of our beloved Caribbean ally is at risk and millions of lives remain imperiled, inaction is inexcusable,” said Congresswoman Yvette D. Clarke, Co-Chair of the House Haiti Caucus. “In the face of the crisis in Haiti, our moral compass and international duty compel us to step forward, not just to alleviate the immediate suffering of the Haitian people, but to address the systemic problems forcing Haitians to flee their homeland. The extension and re-designation of Temporary Protected Status (TPS), alongside an expedited parole program and an immediate halt to deportations, are critical first steps. But our responsibility does not end there. We must confront the root causes of migration by: (1) ensuring that Haitians can live safely and peacefully within their own borders; (2) taking a firm stand against the trafficking of firearms from places like Florida to Haiti; (3) holding those who perpetuate violence and instability accountable,” said Congresswoman Sheila Cherfilus McCormick, Co-Chair of the House Haiti Caucus. “As a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I have a pulse on the challenges facing our allies around the world. Just as we have extended our support to them during their time of need, Haiti deserves the same treatment. The time for action is now – to protect lives, foster security, and promote stability where Haitians can thrive in their own country.” “To deport people back to Haiti is a cause and kiss of death,” said Congresswoman Frederica Wilson. “There is nothing in Haiti but suffering, so we have to say to the President of the United States, ‘Stop the deportation.’ Not only expand TPS but stop the deportation and support the new government that we are putting together in Haiti. This government is being supported by the international community, the United States government, and the Caribbean community; it is Haitian-led. We must fund them—fund them just as we do other countries. Fund them! Fund them just like you fund other countries.” The lawmakers were joined by Guerline Jozef, Executive Director of Haitian Bridge Alliance, Patrice Lawrence,\\xa0Executive Director of UndocuBlack\\xa0Network, Mary Estimé-Irvin, Chairwoman of National Haitian American Elected Officials Network, Tessa Petit, Executive Director of Florida Immigrant Coalition, and impacted families and TPS recipients. “It’s urgent for President Biden to re-designate and extend TPS for Haiti,” said Guerline Jozef, Co-Founder and Executive Director, Haitian Bridge Alliance. “Equally vital is for the United States Congress to pass an economic package supporting job creation and key infrastructure projects. Additionally, the Biden administration must immediately cease the deportation of Haitian nationals. Sending people to a country plagued by insecurity and humanitarian crises is\\xa0 unconscionable. The disparate treatment of Black immigrants must come to an end!” “UndocuBlack Network calls on the Biden- Harris administration to end the cruelty against Haitians. It is cruel to deport Haitian nationals while arranging for evacuation of American nationals at the same time. Our ask is simple, honor the dignity of Haitian people. If Secretary Mayorkas leads by these values, he will release Haitians from detention, extend and redesignate TPS for Haiti and stop the deportations now. To be the change President Biden claimed to be, he must act differently from his predecessors especially as it relates to Black immigrants,” said Patrice Lawrence, Executive Director, UndocuBlack Network. “The painful reality of the Haitian people is complex and multi-layered.\\xa0 However, the immediate steps that need to be taken can happen with the stroke of a pen. It is time for the Administration to redesignate and extend TPS for Haiti. It is also crucial that all deportation of Haitians be immediately halted,” said Tessa Petit, Executive Director, Florida Immigrant Coalition. “Haitians need security, justice, understanding and acceptance.\\xa0 That will only be possible with the will from the administration to support Haiti by addressing its root causes, through a comprehensive humanitarian and economic support that will change the future of the Haitian people.” “An economic plan akin to the Marshall Plan is essential to aid Haiti, which is located less than 90 miles from our shores, in addition to humanitarian assistance and the reconsideration of TPS,” said Mary Estimé-Irvin, Chairwoman, National Haitian American Elected Officials Network. “Like Israel, Ukraine, and Taiwan, Haiti is a sovereign nation that requires support.” Footage from the press conference can be found here, and photos can be found here. As Representative for the Massachusetts 7th\\xa0Congressional District, Congresswoman Pressley serves as Co-Chair for the House Haiti Caucus and represents one of the largest Haitian diaspora communities in the country, with approximately 46,000 Haitians and Haitian-Americans living across the state and over half in the Boston metropolitan area. Additionally, Massachusetts is home to more than 4,700 Haitians with Temporary Protected Status. ### Washington DC Office 402 Cannon HOB\\r\\nWashington, DC 20515 Phone (202) 225-5111\\r\\nFax (202) 225-9322 District Office 1295 River Street\\r\\nHyde Park, MA 02136 Phone (617) 850-0040\\r\\nFax (202) 225-9322',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, Representative Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.-07), along with U.S. Senators Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, and Border Safety, Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), and Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), and Representative Nanette Barragán (D-Calif.-44), joined advocates from FWD.us, American Families United, UnidosUS, CASA, and others to call on President Biden to protect long-term undocumented immigrants in the United States. The members and advocates urged the Biden Administration to take urgent action, reportedly under consideration, to provide protections and relief for long-term undocumented individuals, including people who have been in the United States for decades, contributing in countless ways to our communities. Specifically, they called on President Biden to expand Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and to streamline pathways to lawful status for undocumented spouses of U.S. citizens, family caregivers, and other long-term residents. Padilla, Durbin, Booker, Cortez Masto, Luján, and Markey previously\\xa0provided their\\xa0recommendations\\xa0to the Administration for executive actions to streamline immigration relief for the undocumented population and\\xa0DACA recipients in the\\xa0United States. “As the Biden Administration considers executive actions on immigration, we must not return to failed Trump-era policies aimed at banning asylum and moving us backwards,” said Senator Padilla. “I urge President Biden to embrace our values as a nation of immigrants and use this opportunity to instead provide relief for the long-term immigrants of this nation.” “Our hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee made clear: Dreamers are American in every way but their paperwork. They contribute to our economy and are foundational to our communities. While Republicans peddle extremist anti-immigrant rhetoric and block bipartisan reform, we need solutions now. That’s why I’m urging President Biden to use his executive authority to provide relief for long-term undocumented immigrants and ensure that families can stay together and live free of fear of deportation,” said Senator Durbin. “I’m proud to stand with advocates and my fellow legislators to reaffirm our commitment to protecting undocumented people, many of whom have been a part of our nation for decades,” said Senator Booker. “These Americans and their families remain ensnared in a dysfunctional system that offers them no path to lawful status. We call on President Biden to take decisive executive action now to provide relief to millions of people and safeguard American families at risk of being torn apart.” “There are hundreds of thousands of Nevadans who live with at least one family member who is an undocumented, long-term resident of the U.S. The President must help protect these hardworking families through executive action so they don’t pay the price for Republicans’ political games,” said Senator Cortez Masto. “The time to act is now, and I’ll keep fighting to fix our immigration system and strengthen our border security—we have to do both.” “There are thousands of immigrants who risked their life to travel to America for a better life. They’ve built lives here, and are now part of the fabric of this nation. They are deserving of a dignified path to citizenship. Both Democrats and Republicans know it’s time for us to fix our broken immigration system,” said Senator Luján. “I urge President Biden to continue working to solve our immigration challenges for our brothers and sisters who already call America home.” “With millions of undocumented immigrants currently living in fear of separation from their families, we need a more streamlined process for undocumented immigrant spouses of U.S. citizens, family caregivers, and other long-term residents to move through administrative obstacles. I will continue to advocate on behalf of DACA recipients and immigrants across this country for an immigration system that prioritizes fairness, humanity, and hope,” said Senator Markey. “President Biden should seize this critical moment by exercising his Executive Authority to rebuild our broken immigration system. We urge him to provide pathways to citizenship and protections for the millions of long-term undocumented residents who have contributed to the rich fabric of the United States,” said Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chair Nanette Barragán. “These are our uncles, aunts, parents, friends, and loved ones, who have raised their own families right here in our neighborhoods. They call America their permanent home, they deserve the chance to come out of the shadows.” “I am proud to be an immigrant, one of just two dozen naturalized citizens to serve in the United States Congress. I know—and the vast majority of the American people know—that America is fueled by the creativity, inspiration and hard work of immigrant families. Harsh, enforcement-only policies that separate families have never worked and will not work. In the meantime, the Biden Administration’s greatest successes have been in using its legal authority to provide more legal pathways through the kinds of actions we are advocating for today. We can boost our economy, enrich our communities, and actually make life better for America families across this country,” said Representative Jayapal. “Immigration relief would be a win-win for immigrant families and our nation. If given access to legal status and work permits, the long-residing undocumented would fill gaps in our workforce, increase productivity, and fuel economic growth,” said Janet Murguía, President and CEO of UnidosUS. “Polls consistently show Americans support relief for the undocumented and it’s the #1 immigration priority of Latino voters. We urge President Biden to act to protect immigrants in American families and with deep roots in the U.S., and we’ll work tirelessly to ensure immigrants sign up for the protection, so they contribute even more to our society, tax base and the economy.” “I know first hand what life in this country is as an undocumented immigrant. I also know the transformational impact of affirmative relief, and the significance of adjusting from temporary status to permanent residence. So I’m here today to urge President Biden in the strongest possible terms to provide affirmative relief via executive action. He could offer legal pathways that would allow as many of 3 million people, including Dreamers, daily caregivers, and other long-settled immigrants to continue working and contributing to their families and communities,” said Maria Praeli, Deputy Director of Government Relations & Coalitions, FWD.us. “DACA has been a lifeline for me, but thousands of DACA recipients like me could also benefit from parole in place – allowing us to adjust our status without having to leave the only country we know as home,” said\\xa0Foday Turay, a DACA recipient, Assistant District Attorney for Pennsylvania, and\\xa0an American Families United member.\\xa0“I want to say directly to President Biden: please grant affirmative relief to protect American families like mine. Parole in place would be a beacon of hope for my family — an answered prayer that would allow me to continue to work as an attorney, contributing to my community by doing what I love. Most importantly, it would provide long-overdue relief to my son and wife, who would no longer have to worry that daddy could be taken away.” “Doing what we thought we needed to do to live our American Dream has become our nightmare. Our family was forced to separate. Our U.S. born children were forced to leave their country to be closer to their mother, and I’ve been living apart from my family for 2 years — our entire family’s mental health, my children’s opportunities, have all been deeply hurt by this separation,” said Gerardo Diaz, a U.S. citizen and an American Families United member who has had to live apart from his family for more than 2 years already. “Two years of not kissing my kids goodnight before they go to sleep and missing out on endless milestones in their young lives. President Biden, please listen to us: we know that you can use your authority to protect and reunite American families like mine. We’ve already seen you reunite families — and there are many more of us who need relief urgently, right now.” \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIssues: Immigration  \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWashington, DC Office\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t2346 Rayburn House Office Building\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWashington.

Clarke, Co-Chair of the House Haiti Caucus. “Our Haitian siblings on the island and throughout the diaspora should know that we have not forgotten them and we will never stop fighting for the just and equitable future the Haitian people need and deserve,”\\xa0said Congresswoman Pressley, Co-Chair of the House Haiti Caucus.\\xa0“Congress and the Biden Administration have a moral obligation to take action to stabilize Haiti and to save lives, including by providing humanitarian and economic assistance, extending TPS for Haiti, halting deportations, supporting a democratic transition led by Haitian civil society, and more. If we truly believe Black lives matter, then that must include Haitian lives.” “In the face of the crisis in Haiti, our moral compass and international duty compel us to step forward, not just to alleviate the immediate suffering of the Haitian people, but to address the systemic problems forcing Haitians to flee their homeland. The extension and re-designation of Temporary Protected Status (TPS), alongside an expedited parole program and an immediate halt to deportations, are critical first steps. But our responsibility does not end there. We must confront the root causes of migration by: (1) ensuring that Haitians can live safely and peacefully within their own borders; (2) taking a firm stand against the trafficking of firearms from places like Florida to Haiti; (3) holding those who perpetuate violence and instability accountable,”\\xa0said Congresswoman Sheila Cherfilus McCormick, Co-Chair of the House Haiti Caucus.\\xa0“As a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I have a pulse on the challenges facing our allies around the world. Just as we have extended our support to them during their time of need, Haiti deserves the same treatment. The time for action is now – to protect lives, foster security, and promote stability where Haitians can thrive in their own country.” “To deport people back to Haiti is a cause and kiss of death,”\\xa0said Congresswoman Frederica Wilson.\\xa0“There is nothing in Haiti but suffering, so we have to say to the President of the United States, ‘Stop the deportation.’ Not only expand TPS but stop the deportation and support the new government that we are putting together in Haiti. This government is being supported by the international community, the United States government, and the Caribbean community; it is Haitian-led. We must fund them—fund them just as we do other countries. Fund them! Fund them just like you fund other countries.” The lawmakers were joined by Guerline Jozef, Executive Director of Haitian Bridge Alliance, Patrice Lawrence, Executive Director of UndocuBlack Network, Mary Estimé-Irvin, Chairwoman of National Haitian American Elected Officials Network, Tessa Petit, Executive Director of Florida Immigrant Coalition, and impacted families and TPS recipients. “It’s urgent for President Biden to re-designate and extend TPS for Haiti,”\\xa0said Guerline Jozef, Co-Founder and Executive Director, Haitian Bridge Alliance.\\xa0“Equally vital is for the United States Congress to pass an economic package supporting job creation and key infrastructure projects. Additionally, the Biden administration must immediately cease the deportation of Haitian nationals. Sending people to a country plagued by insecurity and humanitarian crises is unconscionable. The disparate treatment of Black immigrants must come to an end!” “UndocuBlack Network calls on the Biden- Harris administration to end the cruelty against Haitians. It is cruel to deport Haitian nationals while arranging for evacuation of American nationals at the same time. Our ask is simple, honor the dignity of Haitian people. If Secretary Mayorkas leads by these values, he will release Haitians from detention, extend and redesignate TPS for Haiti and stop the deportations now. To be the change President Biden claimed to be, he must act differently from his predecessors especially as it relates to Black immigrants,”\\xa0said Patrice Lawrence, Executive Director, UndocuBlack Network. “The painful reality of the Haitian people is complex and multi-layered. However, the immediate steps that need to be taken can happen with the stroke of a pen. It is time for the Administration to redesignate and extend TPS for Haiti. It is also crucial that all deportation of Haitians be immediately halted,”\\xa0said Tessa Petit, Executive Director, Florida Immigrant Coalition.\\xa0“Haitians need security, justice, understanding and acceptance. That will only be possible with the will from the administration to support Haiti by addressing its root causes, through a comprehensive humanitarian and economic support that will change the future of the Haitian people.” “An economic plan akin to the Marshall Plan is essential to aid Haiti, which is located less than 90 miles from our shores, in addition to humanitarian assistance and the reconsideration of TPS,”\\xa0said Mary Estimé-Irvin, Chairwoman, National Haitian American Elected Officials Network.\\xa0“Like Israel, Ukraine, and Taiwan, Haiti is a sovereign nation that requires support.” Footage from the press conference can be found\\xa0here, and photos can be found\\xa0here. ### \\n Sign Up for email updates from Congresswoman Yvette Clarke.',\n",

       " \"Ever since Hamas unleashed itself on Israel in October, far-left Democrats and corrupt university leaders have allowed antisemitism to overrun America's once great higher education institutions. All law and order and academic integrity have been thrown out the window as elitist, pro-Hamas student protest groups continue setting up 'Gaza Solidarity' encampments at their schools to protest Israel's right to protect itself from terrorism. In some states, law enforcement has acted swiftly to shut down the mobs; in others, university leaders have protected the protesters, allowing them to continue their hateful demonstrations. The First Amendment protects Americans' rights to assemble and express our views through peaceful protest. It does not, however, protect entitled students who try to wrongfully evoke those rights through aggressive protests promoting terrorism.\\xa0 The scenes from these protests are downright despicable. Protesters are ransacking academic buildings, they're blocking anyone who refuses to condemn Israel from attending class, and Jewish students no longer feel safe to walk through campus. Enough is enough. Antisemitism has no place in America, especially at our colleges and universities. We must bring back moral decency to our higher education institutions. House Republicans, under the leadership of Speaker Mike Johnson, have launched a House-wide probe into campus antisemitism. This probe will not stop until Jewish students can feel safe again on campus and those who have been compliant in this hatred are held accountable. This week, as part of that effort, I voted to pass the Antisemitism Awareness Act, bipartisan legislation that will be a critical step in taking action to protect Jewish students nationwide. Our Jewish brothers and sisters are looking to us to stand up against hatred. I will continue to work with my House Republican colleagues to lead in this effort where university presidents and far-left Democrats have failed.\",\n",
       " \"Washington, DC – Today, Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries spoke on the House Floor in opposition to the Hands Off Our Home Appliances Act. He emphasized that while extreme MAGA Republicans are focused on liberty for laundry and dignity for dishwashers, House Democrats are fighting for lower costs, safer communities and reproductive freedom.\\xa0 LEADER JEFFRIES:\\xa0Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you to the distinguished gentleman from the great state of New Jersey for yielding and for his tremendous leadership.The House of Representatives, of course, is the institution the framers designed to be the closest to the American people, the first institution mentioned in the United States Constitution, the People’s House, the place where President Abraham Lincoln declared that America is the last best hope of Earth, the place where FDR made clear the importance of defending democracy against the tyranny of Nazi fascism. It’s the place where President Lyndon Baines Johnson talked about the importance of the Voting Rights Act, and made clear to America that we shall overcome.The House of Representatives is a special place. And so earlier today I was told you need to get to the House Floor to deal with the signature piece of legislation from the extreme MAGA Republicans in this 118th Congress. And so, I wondered to myself, is it going to be about inflation, lower costs, housing affordability, public safety, dealing with the challenges at the border, Social Security, Medicare, what is it going to be about? And it turns out the signature piece of legislation for the extreme MAGA Republicans this week, this month, this year is Hands Off Our Home Appliances Act. This is what we are dealing with? On this magical House Floor, with all of the challenges that the American people are confronting. Liberty for laundry? Defending the dignity of dishwashers? Fighting for freedom of refrigerators? This is what we’re doing? You can’t make it up. You can’t make it up.As House Democrats, we are going to defend democracy. Extreme MAGA Republicans are working on defending the dignity of dishwashers. As House Democrats, we are going to protect and strengthen Social Security. Extreme MAGA Republicans are apparently interested in protecting gas stoves against phony accusations of oppression. House Democrats are going to defend reproductive freedom. Extreme MAGA Republicans focus on the freedom for refrigerators. We believe in a woman’s freedom to make her own reproductive healthcare decisions. Period. Full stop. And women’s health care and protecting the women of America against extreme MAGA Republican overreach. And instead of leaning into the protection of reproductive freedom, instead of trying to strengthen Social Security and Medicare, you want to criminalize abortion care. You want to impose a nationwide ban and then waste time on the House Floor as it relates to the liberty of laundry. You can’t make this up.And so, I just urge my Republican colleagues to partner with us. If you want to push back against overreach, push back against the pro-Putin, extreme overreach on your side of the aisle that doesn’t want to defend democracy and freedom here and abroad. It’s undermining it. And we extend the hand of partnership, as we’ve repeatedly done, to solve real problems for the American people. But those problems have nothing to do with the dignity of dishwashers, the freedom of refrigerators or the liberty of laundry. Let’s get back to doing the real business of the American people. Vote no against this legislation.

       " \"Washington, DC –\\xa0Today, Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries delivered remarks at the Holocaust Days of Remembrance ceremony to honor the survivors, remember the victims and make clear our commitment to fighting antisemitism in all its forms.\\xa0 Leader Jeffries: President Biden, Speaker Johnson, Speaker Emerita Pelosi, Ambassador Eizenstat, Director Bloomfield, all of my colleagues in Congress, honorable ambassadors. To Frank, Abe, Manny, Rae, Alfred, all those survivors whose lives we honor and to all those assembled for this incredibly important event, thank you for your presence here today.Let me begin by making clear our commitment to doing everything that we can, with the positions of authority that we have, in the times when it matters the most, to ensure that never again, unequivocally, means never again.More than 40 years ago, Congress established the Days of Remembrance and enshrined into law the moral necessity to gather in commemoration of the 6 million Jews who were brutally murdered during the Shoah.Holocaust survivor, author and noted humanitarian, Elie Wiesel, when accepting his Nobel Peace Prize in 1986, said that “action is the only remedy to indifference” and he made clear that indifference is “the most insidious danger of all.”This is a day for remembrance and action. A day to honor the memory of all those murdered by the evil Nazi regime. It’s a day to honor the Holocaust survivors, like Eva Cooper from New York City, and so many others who endured and escaped unconscionable atrocities. It’s a day to recommit to the struggle against indifference. As the\\xa0El Maleh Rahamim prayer that will be heard today so beautifully and hauntingly pleads, we gather to ask God to protect and elevate the souls of those taken from our world too soon.We are also here exactly seven months to the day of the horrific atrocities committed by Hamas on 10/7, the largest loss of Jewish life on a single day since the Holocaust. There are families whose loved ones were slaughtered. There are hostages still being held in horrific conditions.And we are witnessing a deeply disturbing rise in antisemitism on campuses throughout the country and in the world. This is a very searing time for the Jewish community. Systematic oppression has been a reality of Jewish life for thousands of years, having to endure expulsions, pain, pogroms, persecution, prejudice and the horrors of the Holocaust, a previously unthinkable crime against humanity.Last Sabbath, Jewish communities across the world read the Torah portion which followed the tragic deaths of Aaron’s two sons, Nadav and Avihu. During this moment of great vulnerability, Aaron receives instructions from God that he, as the High Priest, must carry out during the Yom Kippur service.We learned from God and Aaron that Jewish life, practice and community must continue in the face of horrific tragedy. Aaron embodies what it means to be resilient when confronting immense pain. Today, in partnership with the Jewish community, we recommit to carrying on with strength and resilience. We recommit to the remembrance of the Holocaust. We recommit to the principle of never again. And we recommit to eradicating antisemitism whenever and wherever it rears its ugly head.As we lift up the spirit and memory of all who perished during the Holocaust and honor the survivors with us today, let us always place irreversible determination over indifference. The effort to combat antisemitism is not a Democratic issue or a Republican issue, it’s an American issue. We must crush antisemitism – along with racism, sexism, Islamophobia, xenophobia, homophobia and all other forms of hatred – together.That’s the American way –\\xa0together. And together, we will defeat antisemitism with the fierce urgency of now. That’s a moral necessity.God bless each and every one of you. God bless the survivors. May God bless the United States of America.Full remarks are available here.\\xa0  ### Subscribe to our e-newsletter that provides updates\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ton important issues, my work in the Congress and what's\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thappening in our district.\",\n",
       " \"\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0At a congressional hearing chaired by Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ) today, two renowned journalists and a top tech executive shared extensive evidence of widespread censorship and persecution in Brazil used to stifle opposition to President Lula, raising alarming concerns over the future of democracy and rule of law in the largest country in Latin America. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 “Since late 2022, Brazilians have been subject to human rights violations committed by Brazilian officials on a large scale,” said Rep. Smith, the Chairman of the House Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations Subcommittee. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 “Friends don’t let friends commit human rights abuses,” said Smith. “The Government of Brazil has pursued Brazilian journalists and even people it considers to be political opponents in the United States. It has used Interpol Red Notices, social intimidation, threats of legal action and extradition, and according to one credible victim of its transnational repression, has sought to use the FBI as a carrier or conduit of its intimidation.” \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0In addition to Rumble Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Chris Pavlovski, Smith’s hearing featured testimony from two renowned journalists, including Michael Shellenberger—who documents the systematic, far-reaching efforts of Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes to ban and punish political opponents of the Lula government—and prominent Brazilian journalist Paulo Figueiredo.\\n\\n\\n \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0“Today, Brazil is no longer a liberal democracy,” said Shellenberger. “It is an illiberal one where people fear speaking their minds for fear of punishment…The censorship in Brazil is the worst I have seen in any Western democracy.” \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0Figueiredo shared his harrowing personal account of abuses by the Brazilian government, which locked him from all social network platforms—including YouTube and X (Twitter)—froze his assets, and subjected him to exorbitant fines. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 “On December 30, 2022, therefore 2 months after Lula's victorious election, I felt the full force of this repression,” said Figueiredo, who was on vacation with his family when he received a call from an acquaintance at a social media company. “She warned me that they had received an order from Alexandre de Moraes himself determining that my networks should be blocked for Brazilians within a maximum of two hours, under penalty of severe fines in case of non-compliance. And that all social network platforms had received the same order.” \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0“I would disappear for my entire audience,” Figueiredo said. “This is the modern equivalent of being sent to a dungeon.” \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0Rumble CEO Chris Pavlovski shared details surrounding the requests he received from the Brazilian government to remove individuals from the platform, even though they did not violate Rumble’s terms and conditions. Instead of complying with the government’s orders, Rumble chose to disable access for users in Brazil while challenging the legality of the demands. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0“Today it is Rumble, yesterday it was X, but tomorrow it could be the New York Times,” Pavlovski said. “The platform shouldn’t matter; the universal right to freedom of speech and expression—the core of Western democracy—is at stake. America needs to step up and take a leading role.” \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Smith, who chaired a historic hearing in 2006 on the complicity of Yahoo, Google, Microsoft, and Cisco in China’s regime of internet censorship and surveillance, noted how Elon Musk has now become a target of the Brazilian government for refusing to comply with what Musk said was “aggressive censorship” that “appears to violate the law and will of the people of Brazil.” \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0“Confirming everything Paulo, and Michael Shellenberger have been saying about Brazil, Alexandre de Moraes added Musk to his ‘fake news’ investigation, and opened an inquiry on Musk for what he called an obstruction of justice,” Smith said. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 “Free speech and media freedom are becoming two of the most important human rights issues of our time,” said Smith. “Without freedoms of expression, we are unable to defend against any other human rights abuses.” ### Chris has three offices dedicated to constituent services.

       " 'Nearly fifteen years ago, I introduced a House resolution recognizing the Winston Churchill Memorial and Library on the campus of Westminster College in Fulton, as\\xa0America’s National Churchill Museum. I was excited for the opportunity to recognize this history right here in central Missouri. Last week, I had the pleasure of revisiting the campus and museum to engage in conversations with current students and staff. This was truly a full circle moment as I returned to the very place I visited as a freshman member of Congress more than a decade ago.  In 1946, Winston Churchill delivered his famous “Iron Curtain Speech” on campus. Churchill was an instrumental figure in bringing an end to World War II and displayed resounding dedication to protecting liberty for all people.\\xa0 As one of the greatest figures of the 20th\\xa0Century, Sir Winston Churchill, a man with a literary bent and a deep devotion to public affairs; remains a political icon to many, even in 2024. Churchill did not merely hate tyranny, he despised it.\\xa0And he reviled communism. The contempt he breathed for dictators -- renewed in his Iron Curtain speech, at the outset of the cold war -- strengthened the West’s faith in the moral superiority of democracy and the inevitability of its triumph. And while much has changed since the times of the speech back in 1946, many of the core principles are still applicable. As Winston Churchill said, “Learn all you can about the history of the past, for how else can one even make a guess what is going to happen in the future.”\\xa0A statement has never rung truer. At the time of his speech, the Cold War was at its height and the U.S. was actively combatting the spread of the red curtain. More than 75 years later, keeping communism out of our borders is still an uphill battle; we are just challenged with doing it in different ways. Our adversaries advance day by day infiltrating our communities, economy, and citizens’ lives. While history isn’t fully replicating itself, knowing and understanding the past has allowed us to prepare for the current day and how we can best assist our allies in their fight against mutual adversaries – I’ll save this deep dive for another day.  Throughout his life, Churchill had many incredible quotes. He once said, “We shape our buildings; thereafter they shape us”. On campus, one the many beautiful pieces of history you will find is the St. Mary the Virgin, Aldermanbury Church, which serves as the campus chapel. The church is a symbol for historical inspiration for many and is a sacred place of worship for students. In 1961, with the support from Winston Churchill himself, Westminster College President, Dr. Robert L.D. Davidson, wanted a unique way to memorialize Churchill’s contributions. After much thought and consultation from his peers, he decided to import a war-ravaged church from England. Yes, you read that correctly, he imported a church! Four years, many permissions, and thousands of bricks later, the St. Mary the Virgin, Aldermanbury Church was built and dedicated on campus. All of this to say, in rebuilding this beautiful structure, ravaged by war, and slated for demolition, it found a new purpose as it was rebuilt on the soil of Fulton, MO. \\xa0The St. Mary the Virgin, Aldermanbury Church is not just a place for worship, but a memorial of Winston Churchill – a man who had a nation’s best interest in mind.  \\r\\nIf you haven’t already, I recommend making a trip out to Fulton to see the Churchill Museum. Whether you find beauty in history, architecture, or being able to piece together Churchill’s thoughts through seeing actual papers, correspondence, and memorabilia; its time well spent, and I couldn’t be prouder it’s in the Third District of Missouri.\\n CONTACT US:\\xa0I encourage you to visit my official\\xa0website\\xa0or call my offices in Jefferson City (573-635-7232) or Cottleville (636-327-7055) with your questions and concerns.

       " \"Washington, DC – Today, Congresswoman Julia Brownley (D-CA) announced the introduction of the VA Marriage and Family Therapists Equity Act, legislation which would expand access to professional therapists for veterans and their families. Specifically, this bill would remove an onerous regulation that limits the practice of nearly half of all the Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists (LMFTs) employed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).\\xa0 Currently, VA hires LMFTs who are licensed through a variety of organizations, including the Commission on Accreditation for Marriage and Family Therapy Education (COAMFTE) program and the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy (AAMFT). On average, 30% of LMFTs do not graduate from COAMFTE programs across the nation, and in California that number rises to 95%. Despite these rates, VA’s current regulations state that only those licensed through COAMFTE may be promoted to supervisory positions. Given the limited pay and career development, this regulation discourages qualified LMFTs from wanting to work for VA.\\xa0 “The current regulations for licensed marriage and family therapists at VA are overly rigorous and are not in line with industry standards, which results in nearly half of all the therapists at the VA to be extremely restricted,” said Congresswoman Brownley. “The varied needs of our nation’s veterans and their families must be addressed through the recruitment and retention of highly-qualified professionals. My bill ensures that VA can significantly expand veterans’ access to therapists and that the delivery of quality and timely care continues to be the standard, not the exception.”\\xa0 “The VA hires licensed marriage and family therapists to serve as providers of essential behavioral health services to our Veterans,” said Christine Michaels, Chief Executive Officer of the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy. “However, VA policy significantly restricts the ability of these MFTs to be promoted to supervisory positions within the VA, a restriction which does nothing to improve care for Veterans while encouraging MFTs working for the VA to leave for other opportunities. This legislation will remove this restriction and encourage employee retention and continuity of care by allowing many more MFTs serving in the VA the opportunity to be promoted to supervisory positions.” “America’s veterans deserve timely access to mental health care, here in California and across our nation. CAMFT wants to thank Representative Brownley for authoring key legislation that will make it easier for more Marriage and Family Therapists to provide care within the VA system, reducing wait times for needed services and ensuring our veterans are supported,” said Joy Alafia Executive Director of the California Association of Marriage & Family Therapists. LMFTs assist individuals and couples through interpersonal conflicts, major life changes, and work to develop appropriate coping mechanisms for a variety of challenges. The unique challenges that our nation’s military and veteran families face need to be addressed through robust, wrap-around services, quality caretakers, and holistic treatment, regardless of location.\\xa0 Read the full text of the VA Marriage and Family Therapists Equity Act, here. ### \\r\\n                            Issues: 118th Congress, Veterans' Affairs  2262 Rayburn House Office Building\\nWashington, DC 20515\\nPhone: (202) 225-5811\\nFax: (202) 225-1100\\nHours: Monday – Friday 9:00am-6:00pm Eastern 223 E.

Clarke (NY-09) and Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick (FL-20), led a group of 50 lawmakers urging the Biden Administration to redesignate Haiti for Temporary Protected Status (TPS), pause on deportations back to Haiti, extend humanitarian parole to any Haitians currently detained in Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s detention centers, end detention of Haitian migrants intercepted at sea, and provide additional humanitarian assistance for Haiti. “We urge the Administration to redesignate Haiti for Temporary Protected Status (TPS), halt deportations back to Haiti, and extend humanitarian parole to any Haitians currently detained in Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) detention centers. Additionally, we request your administration’s end to the detention of Haitian migrants who were interdicted at sea. The possibility of transferring them to Guantánamo Bay naval base and other offshore migrant detention centers is concerning and must not be explored. In addition, we are asking that you provide humanitarian assistance to help Haitians navigate these tragically traumatic and difficult times,” the lawmakers wrote in a letter to the Administration.

       " \"Brooklyn, NY – In case you missed it, Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries appeared on CBS 60 Minutes with Norah O’Donnell where he emphasized that House Democrats remain committed to supporting our allies, defending freedom and delivering results for hardworking American taxpayers, while extreme MAGA Republicans continue to bend the knee to Donald Trump.\\xa0 Norah O’Donnell:\\xa0The United States Congress is not particularly popular these days and look no further than the current session to understand why. It will likely be the least productive Congress since the Civil War. One lawmaker who’s figured out a way to get a few things done is Congressman Hakeem Jeffries. He replaced Nancy Pelosi as the leader of the Democrats in the House over a year ago and the 53-year-old has built a reputation as a consensus builder in his own Caucus and as a tough but respectful opponent of the Republican Party. Minority Leader Jeffries could potentially become the first Black Speaker of the House, though to hear him tell it, the Democrats are already in charge.\\xa0 Leader Jeffries:\\xa0Even though we’re in the minority, we effectively have been governing as if we were in the majority because we continue to provide a majority of the votes necessary to get things done. Those are just the facts.Norah O’Donnell:\\xa0The fact is, Republicans in the House are a majority in name only. With just two votes to spare, infighting has crippled their Conference. Even some Republican members are at their wits’ end.Rep. Troy Nehls\\xa0(R-Texas, on April 9): The Lord Jesus himself could not manage this Conference.Leader Jeffries:\\xa0It’s a difficult situation on the other side of the aisle, because many of my Republican colleagues are more interested in creating chaos, dysfunction and extremism.Norah O’Donnell:\\xa0For what purpose?Leader Jeffries:\\xa0That’s a good question that has to be asked of them.\\xa0We were sent by the American people, to get things done, to solve problems.\\xa0At the end of the day, some people don’t have that view of the job.Norah O’Donnell:\\xa0Nine months after getting the job of speaker, Republican Kevin McCarthy of California got dumped by the far-right wing of his party. Following three weeks of paralysis, Mike Johnson of Louisiana took his place. After he worked with Democrats to pass the foreign aid bill that included $61 billion for Ukraine, Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who opposed it, said she will follow through with a threat to oust him. Jeffries told us he works to find common ground with the other side of the aisle and at least one Republican who might be happy about that is Speaker Johnson. This past week Democrats said they would vote against Congresswoman Greene’s effort to remove him.Norah O’Donnell:\\xa0Has Speaker Johnson asked for your help?Leader Jeffries:\\xa0He has not. And our view would traditionally be, “Let the other side work its own mess out.”\\xa0But when that mess starts to impact the ability to do the job on behalf of the American people, then the responsible thing at that moment might be for us to make clear that we will not allow the extremists to throw the Congress and the country into chaos.Norah O’Donnell:\\xa0As chaos spreads across college campuses nationwide over Israel and Gaza, some far left members of Jeffries’ own party have shown support for protestors…\\xa0Leader Jeffries, whose district is 11% Jewish, spoke about the protests at his weekly press conference this past Wednesday.Leader\\xa0Jeffries\\xa0(on May 1): Peaceful protest is an important part of the fabric of America but we shouldn’t see any protest ever veer into threatening the safety and security of others, into antisemitism, or racism or xenophobia.Norah O’Donnell:\\xa0In all, 37 House Democrats recently voted against sending more military aid to Israel.\\xa0The divisive issue will follow Leader Jeffries and President Biden into the election this November, where control of the White House and Congress looks like a coin flip.Norah O’Donnell:\\xa0What do you think about how Israel has been waging this war against Hamas in Gaza?Leader Jeffries:\\xa0Israel was put in a very difficult situation when it comes to the horrific events of 10/7– a brutal terrorist attack by Hamas, which is an entity that has sworn to wipe Israel off the face of the Earth. So Israel was in a position where of course it had to respond, to decisively defeat Hamas.\\xa0At the same time, my view has been that we have to do everything possible to get the hostages out\\xa0and to surge humanitarian assistance into Gaza.\\xa0Norah O’Donnell:\\xa0But isn’t it also true that while retaliating and going after Hamas terrorists, that Israel has been indiscriminate in its bombing?Leader Jeffries:\\xa0I would not say that they’ve been indiscriminate. I do think what we’d like to see moving forward is the execution of the new phases of this conflict with surgical precision.Norah O’Donnell:\\xa0You can still be a strong supporter of Israel and Americans’ defense of Israel and be critical of their approach, about how they waged this war in Gaza.Leader Jeffries:\\xa0That’s correct.Norah O’Donnell:\\xa0But you seem reluctant to criticize Israel at all.Hakeem Jeffries:\\xa0I’m dealing with the facts– on the ground.\\xa0Norah O’Donnell:\\xa0The facts are there are – according to the UN – half of Gaza’s 2.2 million people are on the verge of famine. Ha– has Israel done enough to get food and aid into Gaza?Leader Jeffries:\\xa0Israel clearly– needs to do more, as– as they have recently acknowledged through their actions to surge humanitarian assistance– into Gaza. The other thing that I think– is important–Norah O’Donnell:\\xa0Only after they killed seven aid workers from World Central Kitchen–Leader Jeffries:\\xa0Correct. And that was– that– that was horrific, including one American. Now in terms of the loss of innocent Palestinian life in this tough theater of war, that is deeply disturbing, tragic\\xa0and should be painful for anyone who has a shred of humanity in their body.\\xa0Norah O’Donnell:\\xa0In March, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a staunch supporter of Israel, spoke out against the way it’s waging war in Gaza.Sen. Chuck Schumer\\xa0(in March): The fourth major obstacle to peace is Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Norah O’Donnell:\\xa0Was Leader Schumer’s speech a turning point?Leader Jeffries:\\xa0Anything that Chuck Schumer has to say on the subject is gonna be incredibly important and received. But at the same time, every single member of Congress has the responsibility of answering to their constituency. That’s the beauty of American democracy. So what Leader Schumer has to say on a given issue, what Mitch McConnell has to say on a given issue, yeah, there’s some importance connected to it in Congress inside the Beltway.Norah O’Donnell:\\xa0That was a very long answer without answering my question. (laugh)Leader Jeffries:\\xa0Well, it– it was– it–Norah O’Donnell:\\xa0I mean, come on.Leader Jeffries:\\xa0Yeah.Norah O’Donnell:\\xa0Chuck Schumer criticizing the Prime Minister of Israel, calling for him to be replaced, that’s a big deal.Leader Jeffries:\\xa0Chuck Schumer’s words speak for themselves. But I think that trying to suggest that Leader Schumer is somehow undermining the U.S.-Israel relationship is ridiculous.\\xa0Norah O’Donnell:\\xa0How worried are you that voters’ frustration with President Biden over the war in Gaza could hurt Democrats’ chances in this election year?Leader Jeffries:\\xa0We can’t take any vote for granted. But I also believe that, at the end of the day, voters are gonna look at the totality of circumstances.\\xa0Who is fighting to deliver for everyday Americans, and who is simply fighting for himself?\\xa0Norah O’Donnell:\\xa0Hakeem Jeffries says he learned about fighting for everyday Americans from his parents. His father was a substance abuse counselor. His mother, a social worker, who Jeffries says taught him and his brother, a college professor, to work hard and be good to people. Jeffries attended NYU Law School, worked for a prestigious law firm, then spent a few years as an attorney for 60 Minutes’ parent company, CBS, before entering politics in 2006.Norah O’Donnell:\\xa0You are the first Black leader for either party in either house ever. What does that say about America?Leader Jeffries:\\xa0Government of the people, by the people\\xa0and for the people isn’t just a theoretical concept. Like, it actually exists in America.Norah O’Donnell:\\xa0He was raised in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, a few blocks away from his district…where Sundays were for church. At 12 years old, he became an usher, and says it taught him how to talk to people…\\xa0Jeffries says he visited more than 60 churches in Brooklyn last year.\\xa0One of Jeffries’ allies told us his ability to connect to both young and old Black voters makes him an important surrogate for President Biden this fall.Norah O’Donnell:\\xa0Black voters are a core Democratic constituency. Why do you think support for President Biden has decreased among Black voters?Leader Jeffries:\\xa0I think that tremendous progress has been made– for African Americans under the leadership of Joe Biden that’s quantifiable. But the reality is, there’s still real challenges.Norah O’Donnell:\\xa0One new challenge in communities in New York City and in many others around the country is the influx of migrants. Shelters to house thousands of them have gone up in and around Jeffries’ district.Norah O’Donnell:\\xa0What do you say to voters who not only see migrants streaming into the U.S. not just from Mexico and Latin America, but also from China and other countries and wonder, “What’s Congress doing about this?”Leader Jeffries:\\xa0We have a broken immigration system and we have clear challenges at the border that we have to confront decisively and in a bipartisan way.\\xa0And the American people are crying out for us to do something about the situation at the border in a manner consistent with our values.\\xa0Norah O’Donnell:\\xa0How big of an issue will abortion rights be this election year?Leader Jeffries:\\xa0It’s gonna be an incredibly significant issue because on its own, it’s about freedom. And the extreme MAGA Republicans have set in motion the erosion of reproductive freedom. We’re gonna fight for it with everything that we’ve got at our disposal.\\xa0If Roe v. Wade can fall, anything can fall. Social Security can fall. Medicare can fall. Voting rights can fall. And God help us all, but democracy itself can fall. If Roe v. Wade can fall, then anything can fall.Norah O’Donnell:\\xa0Leader Jeffries says Democrats have a story to tell beyond what voters have to lose in November, and pointed to legislative wins for gun safety, and the billions invested in American manufacturing and infrastructure.Leader Jeffries:\\xa0Those are real results.\\xa0Norah O’Donnell:\\xa0But two-thirds of voters think the economy was better under President Trump.Leader Jeffries:\\xa0Well, that’s just not the case. And we have to do a better job of laying out the facts that the economy has dramatically improved under the leadership of President Joe Biden.\\xa0Norah O’Donnell:\\xa0But if– if those are the facts, why don’t voters believe it? Is that a communication problem?Leader Jeffries:\\xa0Voters understand that more needs to be done, that there are challenges that remain. We understand we have to lower costs. We have to end price gouging. We have to grow the middle class. We have to keep our communities safe. We have to solve the problems and challenges at the border.\\xa0We’re on the right side of those issues. And we just have to make sure we make that case in a compelling, a clear and a comprehensive way to the American people.Norah O’Donnell:\\xa0You admit you haven’t done that yet?Leader Jeffries:\\xa0It’s a work in progress.Full interview can be watched\\xa0here. ### Subscribe to our e-newsletter that provides updates\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ton important issues, my work in the Congress and what's\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thappening in our district.\",\n",

       " 'FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: May 6, 2024 MEDIA CONTACT:\\xa0 e: brian.phillips@mail.house.gov c: 202.913.0126 New York, NY\\xa0— Today, Congresswoman Yvette D. Clarke (NY-09) and U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) held a joint press conference to announce the reintroduction of their bicameral Affordable Housing and Area Median Income Fairness Act. While many factors contribute to the housing crisis, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) calculation known as Area Median Income (AMI), used to determine rent prices and income limits for affordable units, disadvantages actual low-income families seeking the affordable housing intended for them. Currently, AMI is informed by income data from the entire metropolitan area – which means data from the wealthiest areas of Westchester and Rockland County is being used when determining who qualifies for housing in low-income communities across the New York City region. This bill takes a multipronged approach to addressing some of the core challenges that have led to a severe lack of affordable housing in our nation’s urban areas. It would create over 350,000 new units of affordable housing with a $15 billion annual investment and directs HUD to assess alternative calculation methods for AMI to better include eligible low-income families in affordable housing determinations. “Soaring rent prices and a severe shortage of affordable housing units are displacing low-income communities nationwide, including my hometown of Brooklyn. This makes basic housing unattainable for those who need it most,”\\xa0said Rep. Yvette Clarke.\\xa0“In Brooklyn, finding affordable housing is extremely difficult. When units do become available, they often go to applicants with the strongest applications, not necessarily the families in greatest need. To combat this widespread crisis, Senator Gillibrand and I are re-introducing the Affordable Housing and Area Median Income Fairness Act. This legislation addresses how the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) calculates Area Median Income (AMI), a statistic that determines income caps and rent levels for affordable housing. I am confident in our ability to bring much needed change, so that we can ensure every person has access to this fundamental right. Because housing is a right for all.” “The affordable housing crisis in this country today is truly out of control. We are seeing the most vulnerable in our communities continue to be priced out of their homes and apartments at the same time that vacancy rates across the city are at historic lows, especially affordable units,”\\xa0said U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand.\\xa0“The Affordable Housing and Area Median Income Fairness Act would reexamine our approach to calculating AMI and invest $15 billion annually to help make housing more affordable for low-income and middle-class families in New York. No hard-working American should have to go bankrupt simply for trying to live in a safe, accessible home, and I look forward to fighting for this bill in the Senate.” “We’ve been working hard to ensure that the State of New York takes decisive action to address the interrelated crises of homelessness, housing instability, and unaffordability, but we know that we need government at all levels to work collaboratively on these enormous challenges. That’s why I applaud my friends Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and Representative Yvette Clarke for their very ambitious proposal to dramatically increase federal funding for production of affordable housing, and to ensure that the housing we do produce and support is truly affordable for New Yorkers who need it. I will do everything I can to support Senator Gillibrand’s and Rep. Clarke’s efforts to win passage of this important legislation, get these resources allocated, and finally ensure that all New Yorkers have the opportunity to live in high-quality, safe, affordable, and accessible housing,”\\xa0said\\xa0State Senator Brian Kavanagh, chair of the NYS Senate Housing Committee. “One in three New Yorkers now spends half their monthly income on rent, a clear indication of the growing affordable housing crisis,”\\xa0said New York State Assemblymember Linda B. Rosenthal (D/WF – Manhattan), Chair of the Assembly Committee on Housing.\\xa0“Rents are rising nationwide, yet wages have remained stagnant, leaving people with fewer housing options than ever before. Reexamining the calculation of the Area Median Income metric, which is relied upon to determine eligibility for affordable housing, would make affordable housing more accessible to those with the greatest need. The Affordable Housing and Area Median Income Fairness Act would also make a $15 billion investment in vital programs that will spur the creation of affordable housing in communities statewide. I applaud Senator Gillibrand for introducing this legislation and look forward to collaborating on solutions to address New York’s affordable housing crisis.” More than one-third of New York City households spend at least half of their incomes on rent, and one-half of households can’t afford basic necessities due to the high cost of living in NYC. In recent years, homelessness in New York City has reached its highest levels since the Great Depression. The Affordable Housing and AMI Fairness Act would: ### \\n Sign Up for email updates from Congresswoman Yvette Clarke.',\n",
       " \"Random Lengths News  May 5, 2024  By Daniel Rivera, Reporter On May 3, Habitat for Humanity Los Angeles announced a new eight-townhouse project in Long Beach and celebrated a $500,000 grant from Rep. Nanette Barragan’s office. The new Habitat for Humanity project will be sited on Orange Avenue in North Long Beach.\\xa0 Barragan requested funding from the House Committee on Appropriations in March 2023.\\xa0 In the letter, she called the project an appropriate use of taxpayer funds due to its support for constructing new homes with affordable mortgages for low-income families. “I have had the opportunity to go on their build sites, to help build homes for communities in need, for families in need of housing, so when we saw this opportunity to bring more housing to Long Beach, we said, ‘Let’s do it.’” Barragan and Habitats have been working together for years, with the representative volunteering with them before her time as a congresswoman. She and the rest of the Habitats Team see it as a crucial part of providing homes to Long Beach while also building generation wealth so that those families can stay in their homes. “We currently have 36 homes in construction like this in Downtown Long Beach. We have built over 100 homes in the city of Long Beach,” Darrell Simien, Habitat for Humanity’s Senior Vice President of Community Development told\\xa0Random Lengths News.\\xa0 “It’s very lucky it passed because we didn’t know if this was going to be a budget to pass in the congress,” Congresswomen Barragan said, referring to the budgetary impasse that caused by the debt ceiling crisis in 2023. The complete federal budget was passed on April 23 and signed into law by President Joe Biden the next day.\\xa0\\xa0 She explained that it’s difficult to get budget items earmarked in Congress due to a change in the rules for earmarking proposals that prohibit non-profits from receiving community development grants from the federal government. And that the request for the housing grant was made before this change happened back in April, any future grants from the federal government will be more difficult to get if not impossible depending on the classification of the organization. Barragan explained that ownership interest was prioritized in order to help low income families be able to attain the goal of generational wealth with an affordable mortgage that go toward financing the building of\\xa0 homes.” Habitat for Humanity uses traditional contractors, volunteer labor, and the labor of prospective homeowners to build the homes.\\xa0 The townhouses will be modular and fabricated off-site in a factory. The modules will then get transported to and assembled on-site with the help of contractors and volunteers.\\xa0 The president and CEO of Habitats for Humanity Los Angeles Erin Rank told\\xa0Random Lengths News\\xa0that this approach will speed up the building process and make it possible to build the homes even faster while keeping costs down.\\xa0 Each townhouse has a 1,300 square-foot floor plan, including two bedrooms, two baths, and a two-car garage along the alleyway in the back.\\xa0The\\xa0site used to be the North Long Beach Library, which closed in 2016 when the Michelle Obama Library on Atlantic Avenue, between Lime and East 59th Street, opened.\\xa0 An acquisition loan provided the land for Long Beach Community Investment Company amounting to\\xa0 $717,000. LBCIC works on behalf of the city and facilitates new homes being built in Long Beach to help address the housing shortages.\\xa0 During the conference, Rank said that a “lemming library” will be installed on-site during construction to honor the history of the library that once stood there.\\xa0 Stay up-to-date on District 44's latest news, updates and more! \\nWashington D.C.

Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL) and Michael Waltz (R-FL), led a bipartisan group of members of Congress in urging the House Appropriations Committee to support the U.S. Department of Energy’s work to advance critical minerals and materials (CMM) innovation in Fiscal Year 2025 appropriations legislation. In a letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, the lawmakers underscored the importance of advancing CMM innovation to support domestic supply chains and reduce the United States’ reliance on CMMs from adversarial nations like China. “Rising demand for critical minerals in the U.S. is leading to increasing dependence on foreign sources of critical minerals and their downstream products. Crucially, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) controls most of the market for processing and refining cobalt, lithium, rare earth elements, and other critical minerals. The PRC’s dominance of these supply chains, according to a White House interagency report, stems from Beijing’s aggressive deployment of industrial policies, including research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) investments and strategic international partnerships, and market manipulation,” the lawmakers wrote. The lawmakers continued, “The Fiscal Year 2025 Appropriations bill creates an important opportunity for Congress to advance CMM innovation and develop next-generation industries free from CCP influence. The Subcommittee, we believe, should fund the essential work of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to develop reliable, resilient, affordable, diverse, sustainable, and secure domestic critical mineral and material supply chains.” “Critical minerals and materials are fundamental to our modern society, quietly powering the technologies and innovations that shape our daily lives. Because U.S. reliance on the PRC and other foreign sources for these materials places our national and economic security at risk, CMM innovation is a bipartisan imperative. Congress must support DOE in taking impactful and wide-ranging actions to address this challenge and secure our domestic supply chains. We look forward to working with the Subcommittee on this matter,” the lawmakers concluded. The letter was signed by Representatives Kathy Castor (D-FL), Rob Wittman (R-VA), Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL), Michael Waltz (R-FL), Chrissy Houlahan (D-PA), Dusty Johnson (R-SD), (André Carson (D-IN), Andy Barr (R-KY), Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ), and Haley Stevens (D-MI).

I’m grateful to the Healey-Driscoll Administration for prioritizing an orderly transfer of ownership that protects our patients and providers, and I won’t stop fighting to hold Steward executives accountable for their gross incompetence that has put lives in the Massachusetts 7th at risk.” In January 2024, Rep.

       " \"Dear Friend, I hope you have had a good week. I wanted to share an update on the work I did this week in Congress. On Thursday, I joined a bipartisan group of Appropriations Committee members in a visit to Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse. We visited the site by boat, were briefed at the U.S. Coast Guard Command Center, and met with local officials to discuss the role of the federal government in assisting with the recovery. Visiting the site in person made it clear just how important the rebuilding of this critical land and sea thoroughfare is. It also highlighted the need for local, state and federal partners to work together on this project. As the lead Democrat on the Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the Department of Transportation, I am committed to ensuring that our country is not only able to address emergencies like this one but also taking preemptive steps to repair damaged bridges and roads that could lead to our next disaster. The Bipartisan Infrastructure bill took critical steps to address this need and Congress must now work to fill any remaining gaps. I will continue working with my colleagues on both side of the aisle and in both chambers until our tunnels, bridges, and roads are the envy of the world. Thanks to funding provided by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Environmental Protection Agency announced the dedication of $3 billion to identify and replace lead service lines in states and territories to prevent lead exposure in drinking water and protect public health. I was pleased to see that $240 million of that funding will go directly towards our great state of Illinois. No matter where you live, everyone should have access to clean, safe drinking water. Today’s announcement is another win in the fight to see this mission through and replace dangerous lead service lines in Illinois. With efforts like these, we can build a future in which access to safe drinking water is a right, not a privilege. As the Ranking Member on the Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development (THUD) Appropriations Subcommittee, I met with the Secretary of Transportation, Pete Buttigieg and the Acting Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Adrianne Todman to discuss their respective department's funding requests for the 2025 fiscal year. In my hearing with Secretary Buttigieg, we discussed protecting the safety of our transportation workers and the department's emergency relief fund in light of the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse. During my questioning of Secretary Todman, I asked if they anticipate additional funding needs for the Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery program and how the department is addressing rising homelessness. Both hearings provided critical insight to developing a THUD appropriations bill that will effectively address our nation's transit and housing needs. Don't forget, our office is always here to help.

These five members led a letter along with 95 of their colleagues\\xa0last July\\xa0calling for the swift finalization of the strongest possible carbon pollution standards for power plants by early 2024. “We are glad to see that EPA heeded our call to finalize a strong rule to cut pollution from dirty power plants and ensure that generations of Americans can breathe clean air and live on a habitable planet. Our power sector is the second largest source of climate pollution in our nation, driving poor air quality in local neighborhoods and accelerating the climate crisis for the entire planet. Time and time again, Congress has reaffirmed EPA’s authority and obligation under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act to protect Americans from sources of dangerous air pollution, including our power plants. “EPA’s power plant carbon pollution standards are an important part of our efforts to achieve our goal of halving America’s planet-warming pollution by 2030. Our most polluting power plants will utilize proven and readily available control technologies to upgrade their facilities to deliver cost-effective and clean electricity to the American people. As a result, these carbon emission standards will slash pollution by 83% below 2005 levels and deliver $370 billion in cumulative climate and health benefits over the next two decades, with almost no impact on electricity rates. “Paired with our historic climate investments, the Biden Administration’s pollution standards only further solidify our path to a clean energy future. While we would have preferred this rule include standards for existing gas power plants, we stand ready to work with the EPA to finalize a subsequent strong rule focused on incorporating a larger percentage of the existing gas fleet than the original proposed rule. Time is of the essence, and we look forward to finishing the job in cleaning up our power sector and closing the gap on our climate and environmental justice goals.” Background\",\n",

WASHINGTON—Idaho Congressman Mike Simpson cosponsored the bipartisan Not Just a Number Act, legislation to require the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to take a more comprehensive look at the factors that best prevent veteran suicide. “Behind every veteran suicide lies a heartbreaking story, a silent struggle, and an irreplaceable loss,” said Rep. Simpson.\\xa0“Through expanding suicide prevention research and a thorough analysis of factors behind veteran suicide, the Not Just a Number Act would provide a better understanding how we can help veterans in their time of need. Supporting our veterans and ensuring they have the resources they need has always been one of my top priorities.\\xa0Our veterans fulfilled their duty to serve us, and now, it's our responsibility to serve them.” The Not Just a Number Act would require the VA to examine benefits usage in their annual suicide prevention report to evaluate the relationship between VA benefits and veteran suicide. Additionally, this legislation would have the VA analyze which benefits have the most significant impact on preventing suicide and require the Department to issue recommendations for the expansion of those benefits in their fight to combat veteran suicides. Lastly, the bill would include a study on upstream veteran suicide prevention, create a toolkit for state and local medical examiners to improve reporting on veteran suicide and a feasibility and advisability study on elevating the VA’s suicide prevention office to the Office of the Secretary level.

       " 'SEATTLE, WA – U.S. Representative Pramila Jayapal applauds the Biden Administration’s decision to cancel $6 billion in student loan debt for former students of the Art Institutes, a system of predatory, for-profit colleges, including the Art Institute of Seattle. “Predatory, for-profit institutions, like the Art Institutes, prey on disadvantaged students striving for a better future,” said Jayapal. “I personally met with students from the Art Institute of Seattle in 2019, the same year they closed their doors with more than 600 students unable to finish the semester. These students were left with crushing debt, incomplete degrees, and few options for recourse. I am grateful to the administration for taking this step to bring justice to students.” This step from the administration is part of the $160 billion in student debt cancellation the Biden administration has authorized, more than 10 percent of all federal student loan debt.\\xa0 After meeting with students from the Art Institute in Seattle, Jayapal introduced the Students Not Profits Act to protect students from the predatory practices of for-profit colleges by ending taxpayer subsidies to these schools. Jayapal is also the lead sponsor of the College for All Act, which would eliminate tuition and fees at public colleges and universities for single-parent families making up to $125,000 and married families making up to $250,000, while also making trade school and community college free for every person across the country. \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIssues: Arts & Education  \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWashington, DC Office\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t2346 Rayburn House Office Building\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWashington.

       " ' Ms. McCollum: Mr. Speaker, I rise to address my vote against H.R. 6090, the Antisemitism Awareness Act.  This bill would require the Department of Education to utilize the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism when interpreting whether an action or practice violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964.   To be clear: I condemn antisemitism in all its forms and stand with the Jewish community as they mourn the losses sustained in the October 7 terrorist attack by Hamas and the subsequent increase in antisemitic incidents in the U.S. and around the world.   But requiring the Department of Education to use the IHRA definition would stifle free speech and curtail legitimate criticisms of the Israeli government’s actions.  I concur with J Street, which noted: “On its own, the IHRA Working Definition, coupled with its contemporary examples, is broad and can label legitimate political speech and critique of Israel as inherently antisemitic. We are concerned that this concerted campaign to require the use of the IHRA definition and its examples by law and regulation creates significant opportunities for abuse and politicization, including by future MAGA-aligned administrations.”  This bill violates First Amendment rights to share and debate ideas and express peaceful dissent. It is too broad and could lead to colleges and universities banning student groups that aim to provide safe refuge, community, and space to discuss issues that are important to them based on the opinion or statement of one student.   Thank you, and I yield back. ',\n",
       " '502 Cannon HOB, Washington, DC 20515Email Me(202) 225-6435 The historic tornadoes which pummeled the eastern and central portions of our state last week were devastating, and supporting the ongoing recovery efforts for Nebraskans remains top of mind. The Nebraska Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) has reported damage to homes, farm equipment and buildings, power lines, other infrastructure, vehicles, and trees across many counties in the Third District. Fortunately, despite the destruction of hundreds of homes, no Nebraskans lost their lives. We owe such great thanks to the hard work of meteorologists, broadcasters, emergency responders, and countless volunteers who have donated time and resources to those affected. Less than 24 hours after the tornadoes went through, Kearney-based Hot Meals USA—founded by in 2019 by Dick Cochran—mobilized to serve thousands of meals to emergency workers, volunteers, and storm victims in Elkhorn, Bennington, Blair and elsewhere. Nebraskans are keenly aware we are in this together and consider it a hallowed opportunity to lend a hand. Yet the recovery efforts will continue for months to come, so we must continue providing necessary support and coordination. I’m grateful Governor Pillen’s dedication of state resources has been prompt. Throughout damage assessments, my team has been in touch with the governor’s team, and I have been working with our full congressional delegation, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to facilitate federal response and claims for disaster relief. My offices in Nebraska City, Grand Island, and Scottsbluff stand ready to assist individuals, families, and businesses who need help navigating government agencies or other relief resources. In addition, I am pleased to offer support to Nebraska’s county and local officials. To ensure damage estimates reflect the needs in the Third District, it is necessary to get an accurate valuation of the cost. Nebraskans who suffered damage are urged to report it to their county emergency management agencies and utilize available federal assistance through Farm Service Agency, Natural Resources Conservation Service, and Rural Development programs. Nebraskans have substantial experience with severe weather, and our geography indicates we will continue to deal with the associated risks. While we cannot control when storms come, what matters is our preparedness and response. I encourage Third District Nebraskans to remain prepared and maintain access to emergency alerts. Taking appropriate precautions can help us be prepared for the event of extreme weather. Thanks to modern communication tools, there are many ways to remain informed about approaching severe weather today such as television, radio, online alerts, weather radios, and early warning systems. Additionally, it’s wise to maintain an emergency kit, including essentials such as water, a flashlight with extra batteries, a battery-operated radio, non-perishable food, and a first aid kit. It is also important to make sure you store copies of important documents, such as property deeds and personal medical records in a secure, waterproof location. The disaster preparedness checklists and information at www.Ready.gov are helpful resources assembled by the Department of Homeland Security. While Arbor Day 2024 was marked by the violent storms which hit communities in Nebraska and other states, it has been wonderfully encouraging to witness the fast-acting kindness of Americans to care for one another. By coming together, we demonstrate the Nebraska value of looking out for our neighbors and gain the strength to overcome whatever comes our way. ###',\n",

During my time at home, I had the opportunity of visiting five of the many great companies that are standout organizations in our area.  I’m grateful to my friend Jen Phillips, who welcomed me to Keshet’s new facilities in Highland Park. Keshet Disabilities & Inclusion provides educational, recreational, vocational and social programs for individuals with intellectual disabilities, operating according to traditional Jewish values.   At the Kindercare facility in Round Lake I visited the different classrooms and talked with the management team about some of the challenges facing childcare providers. I enjoyed my time meeting the “students” ranging in age from six weeks to five years old, especially having the chance to read to one of the groups.\\xa0  Thanks to the team at ARCOA for showing me around their facilities in Waukegan and Gurnee. ARCOA works with clients to securely recycle and remanufacture technology like computers, copiers and more). They serve clients around the world, including the U.S. government.  I also toured Handi-Foil’s Antioch facility, learning how they combine innovation and attention to detail to provide high-quality, American-made foil products to familiar names like Costco, Sam’s Club and Chipotle.  I visited Von Bergen Farm in Hebron to talk with Mike Von Bergen and other members of the Conserve FS and Growmark family. We talked about some of the challenges farmers face and the importance of passing the Farm Bill before the end of the year. We also shared some of Mike’s mother’s delicious apple pie. I love welcoming people to our Lincolnshire office to talk about policy, share ideas, or help tackle challenges people face in dealing with our federal agencies. Remember, if you would like to meet with me, you don’t have to travel to Washington;\\xa0you can always request a meeting here at home.  The executive board of the Ukrainian Congress of America came to update me on the war in Ukraine and reinforce the importance of the House passing the essential aid bill that will help the people of Ukraine defeat Russia’s illegal invasion.  I enjoyed catching up with representatives from New York Life to talk about the important work they do serving their client's financial security needs.  Allan Navaro, Facility Administrator at DaVita’s center in Lake Villa, and Kiyomi Hamilton, Regional Director, came to our office to share the work DeVita is doing to provide for people in Lake County and across the country who are dealing with kidney disease.  Lake County Administrator Patrice Sutton and I met to discuss how we can work together to serve Lake County residents. Administrator Sutton was elected to her current position in October of 2023. WHAT’S HAPPENING IN WASHINGTON  One of the early signs of spring is the annual visit with representatives from our local Garden Clubs. This year, I welcomed guests from Lake Forest, Winnetka and Wilmette to discuss their legislative priorities for the year.  Dr. Tom Shanley (President and CEO), Susan Hayes Gordon (SVP, Chief External Affairs Officer) and Fatema Zanzi (EVP, Chief Administrative and Legal Officer) of Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital in Chicago stopped by to discuss federal policies impacting child health and issues specifically important to Lurie.  American companies play an important role in Egypt’s economy. Members of the American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt visited Washington to highlight their work and the importance of a strong U.S.-Egypt relationship.  The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum hosted a group of college-age immigrant students from Paris who traveled to the U.S. to learn more about the Holocaust and fighting hate. As a Trustee of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, I was happy to welcome them to my office and discuss my work combatting antisemitism.  My good friend Ted Deutch, a former colleague and CEO of the American Jewish Committee, sat down with members of the House Bipartisan Task Force for Combating Antisemitism to discuss the ongoing battle against antisemitism in America.  I was honored to address the ANC of Illinois during their annual visit to the Capitol to discuss the ongoing situation in Artsakh (Ngorno Karabakh) and the future of Armenian–U.S. relations.  The Asian American Hotel Owners Association met on Capitol Hill to discuss their industry with legislators and how their businesses impact their communities. I was happy to stop by and express my appreciation for their work, especially to connect with friends from home.  My dear friend David Lega, a member of the European Parliament in Brussels, and Magnus Berntsson, a member of the Swedish Parliament, dropped by to discuss shared interests between the European Union, Sweden and the United States. David is also a founder and fellow member of the Inter-Parliamentary Task Force Combating Online Antisemitism.  I met with student leaders of Olami, a worldwide outreach organization for Jewish students, leading a grassroots initiative empowering students to take a stand against antisemitism. I’ve been clear that we must call out antisemitism and all prejudice and hate wherever and whenever it rears its ugly head.

       " \"Maybe, just maybe we will vote this weekend on the essential national security and foreign assistance funding bill. More on that in a moment, but first, I want to reflect on a local story.  Dax with partner, Deputy John ForlenzaSource: Lake County Sheriff All of Lake County joins with the Lake County Sheriff’s Office in mourning the passing of K-9 Dax two days after the often-decorated police dog retired from service. Books could be written about the important contributions Dax made to the sheriff’s office and our community--and likely will be. Just as significant as his heroic deeds, however, was the role Dax played in connecting the community. Anyone who ever met him will remember Dax as a kind soul.\\xa0\\nIn a fitting tribute to Dax, virtually every local news outlet ran a story about Dax’s life and loss (ABC,\\xa0CBS,\\xa0Fox 32,\\xa0NBC,\\xa0WGN,\\xa0Daily Herald,\\xa0Sun-Times,\\xa0Chicago Tribune). May Dax’s memory live in the hearts of everyone he touched.\\xa0\\nBack in Washington, Congress returned to work after a short but eventful weekend. The world tensely watched Iran’s unprecedented attack on Israel last Saturday night—for the first time launching their attack from Iranian territory and involving more than 170 suicide attack drones, 30 cruise missiles, and 120 ballistic missiles. Iran’s salvo was joined with rockets fired at Israel by Hezbollah in Lebanon, militias in Syria, and the Houthis in Yemen. Thankfully, a truly remarkable alliance comprising Israel, the United States, the\\xa0United Kingdom, the\\xa0Kingdom of Jordan, and others coordinated to defeat 99 percent of the missiles and drones before they were able to reach their intended targets.\\nFollowing the attack, House leadership changed its original plans for the week and will now, finally, focus on the critically important national security and foreign aid funding legislation requested by the White House late last year and passed by the Senate more than two months ago. Unfortunately, rather than simply passing the single, comprehensive Senate bill, which would then immediately go to President Biden for his signature, Speaker Johnson is trying to appease the extremists in his party with a jerry-rigged set of separate bills that will at best, delay the essential aid and humanitarian assistance desperately needed by our allies in Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan. Worse yet, it’s not clear Speaker Johnson will even be able to convince the extremists to allow the bills to come to the floor for a vote.\\nI’m remaining in Washington into the weekend as we move toward a vote on this important legislation. I’m hopeful we will finally pass this crucial national security aid and that the Senate will quickly approve it, at long last sending it to President Biden to sign. Please keep reading to learn more about happenings here at home and in Washington.  If you or your student is interested in Military Academy Service, please join me on Wednesday, April 24th from 6:00 pm to 7:30 pm for Service Academy Night. We will discuss how to apply for military academies and what you need to know throughout the nomination process.\\xa0Click here to RSVP.\\nAfter the program concludes, students and parents will visit the tables to talk one-on-one with the academy representatives. Students, parents, guidance counselors and school officials are welcome to attend.\\nQuestions? Call my office at (847) 383-4870.  It was a pleasure to speak at and attend the Thomas W. Doig Chapter of the Credit Unions’ Legislative Breakfast in Vernon Hills. We were joined by leaders of over 19 credit unions in their Chapter, serving over 275,000 members. I enjoyed being on a panel with Sen. Dan McConchie, State Rep. Rita Mayfield, Rep. Mark Walker, and Rep. Kevin Olickal.  The Prime Minister of Japan, Fumio Kishida, addressed a joint session of Congress last Thursday as part of his week-long visit to Washington. The Prime Minister’s address served as a reminder of the\\xa0important\\xa0role the US has played as a global leader and the need to set aside any doubt about what our role in the world should be. Our allies, such as Japan, count on us to help foster a secure and prosperous world and deter the threats of nefarious actors.\\xa0\\xa0  Last week, I also worked with my colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee to set the stage for work that will happen on tax policy in 2025. In 2017, my Republican colleagues passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act through a cynical, partisan process that was a far cry from the bipartisan, long-lasting tax policy we should be focused on. I’m looking forward to working with my colleagues on tax legislation that will bring relief and lasting change for Illinoisans, including an expanded Child Tax Credit and a Sustainable Aviation Fuel tax credit that will accelerate cleaner air and skies for us all.\\xa0 You can watch my remarks\\xa0here.  Today marks the 194th day that more than 130 hostages, including 8 Americans, are being held in Gaza. Last week, as family members of the American hostages sat in the House Gallery, I was honored to lead a bipartisan group of colleagues on the House floor in a call for Hamas to accept the six-week ceasefire proposal brokered by the United States, Egypt, and Qatar and accepted by Israel. The agreement would immediately release all women, children, and those needing medical assistance, opening the door to a more long-term resolution to the fighting. Sadly, as of yesterday, Hamas is still refusing to accept a ceasefire deal. You can watch my remarks\\xa0here.  I was happy to welcome Keeping Families Covered and Cradles to Crayons Chicago to my office in Washington, DC, to discuss diaper banks' important role in supporting families. Did you know that 1 in 2 families nationwide struggle to afford diapers? On April 3rd, Keeping Families Covered held a mobile distribution event at Warren Library in Gurnee, where they distributed:\\xa0 Overall, they served 362 children and 291 families in just two hours; I applaud their work ensuring no family is left without these essential items.  Illinois TRIO helps first-generation, low-income students and students with disabilities enter and complete college. I greeted them on their visit to the Capitol, and we discussed the impacts the federal TRIO program has on Illinois students.  The Regional Transit Authority oversees the Metra, PACE, and the CTA. I welcomed their leadership team to my office to discuss their funding and planning priorities for the next fiscal year.

Did you know that when Ukraine was under Soviet rule, Matzah baking was a criminal activity? Today, Ukraine is the largest exporter of Matzah outside of Israel!

Schneider\\nMember of Congress\",\n",
       " 'For all of those observing, I hope you are having a meaningful Passover! The big news of the week was that on Saturday, the House finally passed critical national security funding that will help our allies Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan counter threats from Russia, Hamas, and China. I was proud to join with House Democratic leadership to insist that, in addition to the security aid for our allies, the legislative package had to also include significant humanitarian assistance, in particular for civilians in Gaza caught in the middle of the fighting between Hamas and Israel.  With Senate passage on Tuesday and President Biden’s signature on Wednesday, the U.S. can now deliver desperately needed military aid to soldiers in Ukraine and humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza and around the world. I’m proud to be part of the bipartisan coalition that advanced this crucial legislation to help our allies – and America’s interests, as well.  I’m also proud to join many others in our community in commending a local hero – Lake County sheriff’s 911 dispatcher Christy O’Dette. Last weekend, Christy calmly and expertly helped save the life of a man attempting suicide in Green Oaks. Please read more about Christy’s great work\\xa0here. Please keep reading to learn more about happenings in Washington and here at home.  Because of the extended week in Washington to pass the foreign aid bills, I had to cancel many events and meetings at home on Friday and Saturday. Luckily, I was able to get home in time to attend the Lake Forest College Public Policy Analysis Challenge. The Public Policy Challenge is a year-long program where 16 teams, each working with a faculty mentor, developed and presented public policy ideas on how to reduce violence in America. On Sunday, the three teams that had earlier advanced to the final round formally presented their proposals to a panel for four judges. I was honored to be able to provide remarks at the start of the evening.  Last week, on the heels of Iran’s recent attack on Israel, the House passed H.R. 6408, a commonsense, bipartisan bill I introduced with Congressman David Kustoff to revoke the tax-exempt status of non-profits that have provided material support to specially designated terror groups (STDGs) or foreign terrorist organizations (FTOs). Put simply, groups giving support to terrorism should not have the privilege of advantaged tax status. You can watch my remarks on the bill\\xa0here.  US Trade Representative Katherine Tai testified before the House Ways and Means Committee about the Administration’s trade priorities. During my time to ask questions of Trade Representative Tai, I highlighted our district’s researchers and innovators, all of whom depend on intellectual property protections. I am grateful for the Biden Administration’s tireless work in protecting US innovation. We also spoke about the importance of strengthening medical-related supply chains and working with trusted trade partners, rather than duplicitous actors like China. You can watch my remarks on the bill\\xa0here.  Prior to passage of the foreign aid bills last Saturday, the House Foreign Affairs Committee held a hearing on the threat posed to U.S. interests by Russo–Iranian cooperation. I asked each of the three witnesses what they considered the most important action for Congress to take to address the growing threat posed by the growing alliance between two of our country’s greatest adversaries. The witnesses all agreed that there is nothing more important than passing the national security funding bills for Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan. Speaker Johnson should have brought to a vote the Senate-passed bill long ago—I’m glad the House was able to deliver that vote over the weekend. You can watch my remarks\\xa0here.  Representatives of the Illinois Health and Hospital Association were in Washington to discuss the SAVE Act, which would create legal penalties for individuals who knowingly and intentionally assault hospital employees. Hospital employees are a cornerstone of our healthcare system; as a proud cosponsor of the SAVE Act, I remain committed to keeping hospitals a safe place for healthcare workers.   Our district is home to a wonderful variety of wildlife. I had the opportunity to meet with representatives of Openlands, an organization dedicated to preserving this wildlife and connecting people throughout Illinois to the outdoors. I appreciate their efforts to expand Hackmatack National Wildlife Refuge in McHenry County, and I look forward to continuing to support the first federal wildlife refuge within 100 miles of Chicago.   As we raced toward the final passage of funding for Ukraine last week, I had the opportunity meeting with UA-Resistance, a charity fund that helps Ukrainians defend against Putin’s continued invasion. And, in anticipation of Passover, they brought a box of special matzah made in Ukraine. I was surprised to learn that Ukraine exports matzahs around the world.   As a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, one of my most important responsibilities is building stronger relationships with leaders from around the globe. Last week, I had a robust conversation with Youssef Amrani, the Ambassador of Morocco. Especially in times like these, we must continue to strengthen the US-Morocco partnership and work toward a Middle East that is peaceful, prosperous, and secure.  I also met with Ekaterini Nassika, the Ambassador of Greece. We discussed cooperation on energy security amid global conflicts and opportunities to continue the longstanding partnership between the United States and Greece.

In case you missed it, the Washington Post\\xa0opined\\xa0last week that, while traditional thinking has always held that humanity tamed dogs, it might be that dogs were the key to our advancement all along. As the author puts it: “Dogs enabled humans to settle down and stop their endless wandering. Dogs protected humans at this vulnerable transition from nomadic to settled life.” While I do not claim to be a biology expert, I can say from personal experience that dogs truly are humanity’s greatest partners. As I enjoy my time in the district—alongside my trusted canine companion, JoJo—I hope this article brings levity and joy into your day, just as it did mine. \\nSincerely,\\nBradley S. Schneider\\nMember of Congress',\n",
       " \"It sure was nice to be home last week, especially after two long weeks and a rare Saturday session in Washington. As always, I enjoyed traveling around the district, with visits to Northfield, Wheeling, Deerfield, Highland Park, Waukegan, Libertyville, and more. Each week at home is distinct, but last week was special—I had the chance to meet with many students, including through student town halls at Caruso and Edgewood Middle Schools, a lunch and learn session with the Together Towards Peace Roundtable and our annual Service Academy/ROTC Information Night with representatives from the Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force and Coast Guard, this year at Vernon Hills High School.\\nBefore I share highlights of my week at home, I want to provide expanded thoughts on a trip I took this weekend, as well as some thoughts about the protests we are seeing on campuses around the country. This past weekend, I had a very special opportunity. I was invited to be a guest speaker at the\\xa0World Economic Forum’s Special Meeting on Global Collaboration, Growth and Energy for Development\\xa0in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. This event brought together nearly 1,000 senior leaders in government, business and NGOs from across the globe for discussions about topics ranging from climate change and clean energy to global trade policy to the future prospects for Middle East peace and development. In addition to my specific session on “Homeland Trade,” I had an opportunity to meet with high-level officials from Saudi Arabia, the United States and other countries to discuss the situation in Gaza and possibilities for a new direction for the entire Middle East. We talked about hopes for a ceasefire with the release of the hostages and a surge in aid into Gaza. I heard about continued plans for pursuing further normalization agreements with Israel, and everyone I met wanted my opinion about the upcoming election in the United States.\\nI returned early to Washington for votes in the House and so I left the conference early Monday morning, before Secretary of State Blinken arrived later in the day. I wish I could have heard Secretary Blinken’s remarks, but I share his and President Biden’s view that we are at an inflection point in the Middle East. I also agree that, while U.S. leadership is critically important, we cannot meet the challenges around the world without strong partners and allies.\\nPerhaps the biggest surprise from my short visit to Riyadh is that I left the conference feeling that there is hope for the future. Based on all I heard, I believe that peace between Saudi Arabia and Israel is within reach – something that creates an unprecedented opportunity to change the trajectory of relations in the region and prove Hamas’s barbaric attacks on October 7 were a fatal strategic error. You can read my official statement about my visit\\xa0here, and if you are interested, you can watch my panel session\\xa0here. As I write this, the world is waiting for Hamas to respond to the latest ceasefire proposal brokered by Egypt, Qatar and the United States. Secretary Blinken, speaking in Riyadh, called the deal “extraordinarily generous on the part of Israel.” \\xa0Unfortunately, the Secretary left the region on Wednesday without a response from Hamas leadership.\\nMeanwhile, I’ve been closely watching, with growing concern, the protests on college campuses around the country, including my alma mater Northwestern. And I\\xa0am aware the protests are spreading to high schools as well.\\nI am and will always be a fierce advocate for and defender of free speech. I believe everyone has the right to have their say and speak their minds, no matter how vehemently I may disagree with their point of view. Freedom of speech does not, however, include the right to harass, isolate or threaten others. Nor does it allow for the violation of university rules and vandalism of campus property.\\xa0\\nI fully recognize and appreciate the immense sadness and pain felt and strong views held by students that identify with both sides of the conflict in Gaza. I understand that pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel advocates are deeply passionate and want their perspectives to be heard and their positions wholly adopted. And I believe there should be no better place than the college to have a robust and thoughtful debate. Sadly, instead of dialogue, we have seen too much of each side trying to drown out the other, as well as outside groups and individuals entering campus grounds to feed the flames.\\nI have been particularly appalled by images of many anti-Israel protestors holding rabidly antisemitic signs, chanting slogans celebrating terrorism and violence, and physically threatening and even assaulting other students. It is the responsibility of school leadership to ensure the safety and security of all students at their universities and colleges.\\nI’ve been extremely disappointed by the responses of many university leaders that have failed to adequately, or even minimally, protect the well-being of all students. Some schools have in fact conceded to the demands of people spewing vile, hateful, demeaning and too often antisemitic rhetoric. We need university leaders to step up and speak out against hate and discrimination, enforce their school’s rules of time, place and manner and do everything in their power to ensure healthy academic communities that allow every student to thrive, irrespective of from where they hail, to what god they pray or how they choose to identify themselves. As for those that cause physical harm to others or intentionally damage school property—schools and their leaders must make sure these individuals are held fully accountable for their behaviors. \\xa0I joined MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell Reports this week to discuss my recent trips to both Saudi Arabia and Israel, as well as campus protests – you can watch that interview\\xa0here.\\xa0Please keep reading to learn more about happenings in Washington and here at home. I started my week in the district by grabbing lunch at Brunch Café with Village of Deerfield Mayor Dan Shapiro and village officials Kent Street and Andrew Lichterman. I appreciated the updates on the village's economic development projects. The pain of losing a loved one to gun violence never fades. Sadly, this is a pain shared by many in our community, from Highland Park to Waukegan. I joined Lake County Leaders and victims of gun violence in Waukegan to discuss the work of the Gun Violence Prevention Initiative. The work being carried out is making a real impact in our community and serving as a model for the rest of the country. I thank the Lake County State's Attorney for helping us invest in bettering our community's safety. I was thrilled to join the Housing Opportunity Development Corporation, State Senator Julie Morrison, State Representative Bob Morgan and community members to break ground on the Zion Woods Affordable Housing Complex. This is a meaningful step toward increasing Deerfield’s affordable housing supply. Mental health is crucial for the well-being of our communities. I joined the Josselyn team in Northbrook to celebrate the kickoff of their annual capital campaign. I'm proud to support their success and work with them to eliminate barriers to mental health services. Last year, I was pleased to successfully advocate for $1 million in federal funding for the center’s new headquarters. I’m always glad to have the opportunity to visit with students and hear about what’s on their mind. I am always amazed at how tuned in to the world they are and how insightful their questions are. At the risk of being boastful, I was invited by my nephew Brady (with my niece Mia) to a town hall conversation with the entire 7th grade at Caruso Middle School. The students asked some of the smartest questions and fully engaged in a vibrant discussion. After a full hour, we all only wished we had more time together. Different day, different school-- this time at Edgewood Middle School. Once again, I was blown away by the questions and tried my best to meet the students’ high expectations. The big surprise was the last question at the end, when a student asked how I order my burritos. Based on the cheers, I am not the only one who likes brown rice, chicken, peppers, onions, lots of veggies, lettuce and cheese. Every year my office hosts students and parents from across the 10th District to learn about the application and nomination process for the five U.S. Military Service Academies, as well as opportunities for ROTC. This year we were graciously hosted by Vernon Hills High School and were honored to be joined via Zoom by Midshipman Andrew Bacilek, who I had the honor of nominating to the US Naval Academy in 2020. Andrew is a member of 13th Company and is a proud member of the class of 2024. As a Navy Dad, it is always encouraging to see so many promising and talented young people interested in serving and protecting their country, and I commend both these students and their families for their hard work and commitment. Each semester, our district and DC offices are joined by a select group of talented and enthusiastic interns who are interested in careers in public service. This semester was no exception. Throughout their time with us, Colin, Liz and Johanna all became important parts of our district team. While we will miss them at the district office, I know they are destined for bright futures ahead. I once again had the opportunity to attend the annual Lake County Mikva Challenge Issues-To-Action Showcase in Waukegan. This year’s event featured civics action projects from schools across our district. The students effectively identified issues that they are passionate about and assessed ways to have an impact around that issue. I enjoyed hearing about each of their projects, and I look forward to seeing them put their strategies into action. I ended my week in the district meeting with students from Highland Park High School and Baker College Prep at a Together Towards Peace Event at Rosewood Beach Interpretive Center.\\xa0 I joined a panel discussion with Majority Leader for the IL House of Representatives Robyn Gabel, State Rep. Bob Morgan, and Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering for a broad discussion on gun violence and its impact on these students’ communities. I appreciated the opportunity to hear about their personal experiences and perspective, as well as their ideas on advocating for safe gun legislation. As we continue our work in Congress to pass gun control reform, I will for sure keep these students’ ideas in mind. \\xa0\\xa0 I welcomed (ret.) Henry P. (Hank) Krakowski to my office. Captain Krakowski has over forty years of aviation experience including three years as Chief Operating Officer of the Federal Aviation Administration and served in numerous positions at United Airlines. We had a great conversation on the rapidly developing zero-emission Advance Air Mobility industry and sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). I had a great time with Allendale President Jason Keeler and new team member Amir Bastanipour. We discussed Allendale’s STAR Program (Shelter & Transitional Adolescent Resources program) for runaway locked-out and homeless youth. I appreciate the work they do to support vulnerable youth; and I’m also very grateful for the plant he gifted my office. Nancy Richman, a constituent of Highland Park, dropped by to advocate for The Medicare Home Health Accessibility Act (H.R.7148). I met with Carole Rosen and other members of the Going Home Coalition and The Arc of Illinois to discuss what more can be done at the federal level to bring more awareness to disability issues. Please visit\\xa0my website\\xa0to find resources available for everything from saving money on your internet bill to locating your local food bank, and various help lines.

If you want to schedule a meeting with me,\\xa0you can do so here. It’s NBA playoff time, but sadly the Bulls are no longer in the mix. Nevertheless, I have a basketball related story I thought might be of interest. Actually, not so much a story as an interesting comparison: Did you know that a full-grown adult blue whale, the largest animal ever to live on Planet Earth, is longer than a basketball court?! \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0Source: Dana Wharf Blog Blue whales are listed as endangered, with an estimated remaining population of between 5,000 and 15,000.\\xa0 That’s why I was so excited to see a\\xa0story about blue whales returning to the Seychelles. So many species around the world are threatened with extinction, either directly by human activities or indirectly by effects of climate change (caused by human activities). The good news is that we are learning how to successfully help many species begin to recover.\\nHave a wonderful weekend. Sincerely, Bradley S. Schneider\\nMember of Congress\",\n",

WASHINGTON— This week, the United States House of Representatives passed the Western Economic Security Today (WEST) Act. Idaho Congressman Mike Simpson—a cosponsor of the WEST Act—voted in favor of this legislation. This bill withdraws the Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM) recently finalized “Public Lands Rule” and would prevent future issuance of a substantially similar rule. The BLM’s rule is a seismic shift in public land management that upends the agency’s multiple use mandate, which has guided land management practices across the West for 50 years. “This rule will significantly impact how Idahoans interact and enjoy the 12 million acres of BLM land across the state,” said Rep. Simpson. “For decades, Idahoans have cherished the concept of multiple use on public lands and have proven to be responsible stewards. The rule jeopardizes years of successful management and collaboration by the very people who rely on our federal lands for ranching, grazing, recreation, and more. As Chairman of the House Interior and Environment Appropriations Subcommittee—which has jurisdiction over the BLM—I will continue to push back against this misguided rule.” The measure was approved with a vote of 212-202.',\n",

       " 'Our country is experiencing a massive shift in technology. Our daily activities often revolve around computers and smartphones. \\xa0 Our Information Technology (IT) infrastructure grows daily. But so do the threats of cyberattacks. \\xa0 This week, the Energy & Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight & Investigations, which I chair, held a hearing focused on the fallout from the February 2024 cyberattack on Change Healthcare.  \\xa0 Change Healthcare (Change), a UnitedHealth subsidiary that was acquired by them in 2022, operates the largest Electronic Data Interchange clearinghouse in the nation, transmitting more than 15 billion transactions every year.  \\xa0 When the hack was discovered, UnitedHealth shut down its Change Healthcare networks. This action had profound consequences for providers and patients. \\xa0 According to the American Hospital Association, 94 percent of hospitals reported being financially impacted by the cyberattack. Hospitals, clinics, medical practices and pharmacies across the country were prevented from getting paid and could not submit claims. Stopping all payments on claims made it difficult for providers and patients. An unknown number of patients had their care delayed.  \\xa0 These consequences were widely discussed on a bipartisan basis during the hearing, which featured UnitedHealth CEO, Sir Andrew Witty.  \\xa0 Patients reeled from this cutoff, prompting them to either walk away, pay large sums of money out of pocket for their medications or borrow money. I am sure some had to use credit cards with high interest rates. \\xa0 NBC News reported patients not being able to afford their medication without copay assistance cards, such as patients at the Marion Family Pharmacy in Marion, Virginia. \\xa0 One individual was forced to pay $1,100 for medication because the Marion pharmacy was unable to process her copay assistance card. \\xa0 When I raised this issue to Mr. Witty, I asked how were this lady and other people similarly situated going to be made whole for their loss. He seemed empathetic. \\xa0 But it was clear to me that UnitedHealth did not have a plan on how to take care of patients who had been harmed. \\xa0 He had no answer as to how much paperwork would be requested from a patient in order to be fully reimbursed. It is not just the $1,100. It’s the interest on that money that UnitedHealth got to keep and receive interest on while the patient was possibly paying interest to a lender.  \\xa0 There is also the possibility of increased medical attention needed for patients that were denied medicine or services because their insurance could not be processed. \\xa0 I hope in the coming weeks UnitedHealth will formulate a plan for making patients whole. \\xa0 Another problem is how does UnitedHealth take care of healthcare providers.  \\xa0 Providers were kept in the dark when claims were not being processed and sparked fears of closures. Congresswoman Schrier (D-WA) told Witty a private practitioner in her district had to mortgage their home to make office rent and payroll.  \\xa0 UnitedHealth “helped” them out by giving them a $70 first-round loan. Big help! \\xa0 It is true the hackers were the bad guys, but as I said in my opening statement, UnitedHealth’s Change did not have Multi Factor Authentication (MFA), which is a standard cyber protection tool. The criminals exploited this weakness allowing them access into the system. \\xa0 Mr. Witty attributed the technology failure to Change’s outdated system. \\xa0 As the largest health care conglomerate in the United States, this response was concerning. \\xa0 Over 50 percent of U.S. medical claims are processed through Change’s EDI clearinghouse. UnitedHealth Group’s vast network encompasses Optum, Optum Rx pharmacies, urgent care centers, United Healthcare Medicare and Retirement plans, including AARP Medicare plans, 10,000 doctors and other subsidiaries. \\xa0 Given UnitedHealth’s sweeping consolidation of medical companies, the company stands as a prime target for bad actors. \\xa0 It begs the question whether one company should be able to control a market share of this magnitude in the healthcare arena. \\xa0 I do not claim to know the answer, but the question must be asked. \\xa0 UnitedHealth had an obligation to protect their customers. They failed! And they failed to have a secure backup plan.  \\xa0 Small medical practices and hospitals are hurting. But the most vulnerable to this incident were the people showing up at their healthcare provider needing care and at their pharmacy needing to get their medicine. \\xa0 UnitedHealth has a big mess to clean up. Going forward, my Subcommittee will examine their actions and then we can determine if UnitedHealth is truly committed to rectifying their mistake.  \\xa0 If you have questions, concerns, or comments, feel free to contact my office.\\xa0 You can call my Abingdon office at 276-525-1405 or my Christiansburg office at 540-381-5671.\\xa0 To reach my office via email, please visit my website at https://morgangriffith.house.gov.\\xa0  \\xa0 ### Enter your email address to get the latest updates straight to your inbox.

       " 'U.S. Congressman Washington, D.C. -\\xa0Congressman Michael C. Burgess, M.D. (R-TX), Chairman of the Rules Committee, testified at the\\xa0Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee on what Congress can do to address the severe shortage of minority health care professionals and the maternal health crisis.\\xa0 Click\\xa0HERE\\xa0for video. Remarks as prepared, below: Chair Sanders, Ranking Member Cassidy, and members of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, thank you for the opportunity to speak at today’s hearing. I am Representative Michael C. Burgess from Texas’ 26th District. Before coming to Congress, I dedicated nearly three decades to practicing medicine in Texas. Between myself, my grandfather, and my father combined we have practiced medicine for nearly the whole of the twentieth century. Practicing medicine can be very complex. However, I chose obstetrics since there is almost always a satisfactory result. I spent time in residency as an OB-GYN at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, Texas. Statistically, Parkland had some of the best outcomes in the country due to its emphasis on proper care and attention of patients. At the time, I remember the Chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology pointed out that the practice of obstetrics is unique in medicine, and those privileged enough to continue were going to be charged with taking care of two patients with a combined life expectancy of 100 years. Nowhere else in medicine does one have the ability to do that.\\xa0 The patient population near Parkland often came from both rural and urban communities in Dallas. In my time, the clientele was multi-ethnic, largely uninsured, or underinsured. Throughout my career, I have delivered over 3,000 babies and treated patients who had suffered from miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies, stillbirths, sickle cell, and other life-threatening conditions. Whether my responsibility was to step in and deliver a baby, or save a life, it was done without hesitation. For this reason, I’ve spent my career trying to increase access to quality health care for patients, both through my experience as a physician and as a legislator.\\xa0 In 2005, I became aware of the rising infant mortality rates in Southeast Fort Worth. Despite the challenges, it took several years of concerted effort, but eventually, I successfully established a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) with a pediatric unit. Remarkably, the center was opened through a longstanding collaboration with the Democratic County Commissioner and Mayor of Fort Worth. It was my experience, expertise, and passion in maternal health care that led me to championing this issue in Congress as well as other health issues aimed at improving health disparities.\\xa0 The alarming trend in our country’s rate of maternal mortality first came to my attention in September of 2018, when I was reading my copy of the Green Journal. The original research cited in the journal stated that maternal mortality rates increased in Texas between 2011 and 2012. The new study found that the number of maternal deaths in Texas in 2012 was less than half the number previously reported.\\xa0 The peer-reviewed research, published in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology, determined there were 56 maternal deaths among Texas residents compared with 147 reported in national statistics. Later on, it was released that the state overcounted the deaths due to a new method of how Texas was reporting data that was different than other states. This retraction of the study made disputes over the statistics the subject of national news coverage as opposed to the lives that need saving.\\xa0\\xa0 I believe that any maternal death is one too many. It is important that we capture these deaths accurately to understand the scope of maternal mortality in the United States and have a better understanding of how to address them. In combination, we cannot legislate good practice, but we can provide the tools to be able to come up with best practices and increase access to maternity care. These critical points have influenced my policy work during my time as a legislator.\\xa0 Throughout the years, I have worked across the aisle on several pieces of legislation that became law, including H.R. 315 The Improving Access to Maternity Care Act and H.R. 4387 The Maternal Health Quality Improvement Act. Additionally, I am currently a lead sponsor of H.R. 3838 The Preventing Maternal Deaths Reauthorization Act, H.R. 7432 The Sickle Disease Comprehensive Care Act, and H.R. 3226 The PREEMIE Reauthorization Act of 2023. In the past, I have led critical reauthorizations of Title VII Health Professional Education and Training Programs to increase access to health care in underserved areas and diversify the health care workforce. I also worked on H.R. 5395 The Expanding Connectivity for Health Outcomes Act (ECHO) Act, which promoted connection between primary care providers and specialists, increasing access to specialty care for underserved communities.\\xa0 Part of the goal of H.R. 3838 was to establish Maternal Mortality Review Committees (MMRCs). These multidisciplinary committees review the causes of maternal deaths in their state or other localities and make recommendations based on their findings to prevent future deaths and improve maternal health outcomes during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period. Through my work on this legislation, Maternal Mortality Review Committees were able to discover that 53% of pregnancy-related deaths happen between seven days and one-year post-partum, leading to the critical extension of the state plan amendment for Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) 12-month post-partum coverage. This year, effective March 1st, 2024, Texas extended postpartum coverage to the full 12 months for eligible Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) recipients through the Texas Health and Human Services Commission.\\xa0 I cannot stress enough the importance of continuing bipartisan work to reduce disparities and improve outcomes, as well as bolster our public health workforce. Throughout the years, I’ve developed great working relationships with members such as Reps. Lisa Blunt Rochester, Robin Kelly, and Danny Davis. It is through these great partnerships that we influence and expand our understanding of health care policy in the nation. With that knowledge, it is my belief that Congress should examine the effectiveness of our existing programs and determine what changes may be necessary to achieve these goals. Congress has an important role, but so do community/physician-led efforts. The work of Congress should be informed by what’s happening on the ground. It is our passion and work that define who we are and leave a lasting imprint on Capitol Hill, shaping policies, building relationships, and fostering change that impacts the lives of countless American patients.\\xa0 Thank you for having me today and for holding this hearing on such important topics. It has been a privilege to discuss my work and experience with you. \\xa0\\xa0 ### Get the most up to date news from me on Twitter.',\n",

       " 'May 2, 2024 Finalized HHS Rules Advances Equity, Bolsters Protections For People With Disabilities Under Section 504 Of The Rehabilitation Act Pressley Has Long Urged Admin. to Improve Access to Healthcare for Folks with Disabilities WASHINGTON\\xa0– Today, Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) issued a statement applauding the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) finalized rule that prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability. This rule, titled Discrimination on the Basis of Disability in Health and Human Service Programs or Activities, advances equity and bolsters protections for people with disabilities under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (Section 504). Rep. Pressley has been a longtime champion for the disability community and recently wrote to the Biden Harris Administration urging the Administration to improve access to healthcare for folks with disabilities. “The unjust status quo has subjected our neighbors with disabilities to daily injustices,” said Congresswoman Pressley. “This much-needed and long-overdue rule is a historic step forward that will help prevent discrimination for folks with disabilities and help them access healthcare and other services they need and deserve. I’m grateful to Secretary Becerra and the Biden-Harris Administration for heeding advocates’ calls and look forward to working with them to further advance disability justice at the federal level.” Reflecting over fifty years of advocacy by the disability community, the Section 504 Final Rule clarifies and strengthens civil rights protections for people with disabilities, addresses discrimination in medical treatment, adds enforceable standards for accessible medical diagnostic equipment, and ensures accessible web content and mobile apps. The rule advances the promise of the Rehabilitation Act and helps protect people with disabilities from experiencing discrimination in any program or activity receiving funding from HHS because of their disability. Section 504 prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in programs and activities that receive funding from HHS. Since the law was enacted, major legislative and judicial developments have shifted the legal landscape of disability discrimination under Section 504. More information about the finalized rule is available here. Rep. Pressley has been a longtime advocate the disability community and has championed policies that promote disability justice. ### Washington DC Office 402 Cannon HOB\\r\\nWashington, DC 20515 Phone (202) 225-5111\\r\\nFax (202) 225-9322 District Office 1295 River Street\\r\\nHyde Park, MA 02136 Phone (617) 850-0040\\r\\nFax (202) 225-9322',\n",

       " 'May 2, 2024 CROWN Act Has Already Been Enacted In 23 States and Dozens Of Cities Nationwide Text of Bill (PDF) | Press Conference (YouTube) WASHINGTON\\xa0– Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) joined Representatives Bonnie Watson Coleman (NJ-12), Barbara Lee (CA-13), Ilhan Omar (MN-05), Gwen Moore (WI-04), Summer Lee (PA-12) and Maxwell Frost (FL-10) to announce the reintroduction of the Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair (CROWN) Act\\xa0in the House of Representatives, a bill to outlaw discrimination on the basis of hair texture. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) also announced reintroduction of the CROWN Act in the Senate.\\xa0 The lawmakers unveiled the legislation at a Capitol Hill press conference. Full video of the press conference is available here. “It is 2024 and discrimination against natural hair continues to disrupt our lives. No one should have the right to punish Black folks for showing up as our full, authentic selves – not in Massachusetts, Texas, or anywhere else,” said Rep. Ayanna Pressley. “We need a federal CROWN Act now more than ever. Whether you are a student in a classroom, an employee in the workplace, or the next Supreme Court Justice, you belong everywhere as you are. I am proud to join my sisters-in-service in reintroducing this crucial legislation to end race-based hair discrimination in America once and for all.” “Our hair plays a significant role in our overall well-being, self-esteem, cultural identity, and personal expression,” said Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman. “Discrimination against Black hair is discrimination against Black people. And we’re going to put a stop to it. I’m grateful to the broad coalition that has developed to pass this legislation and look forward to working with them to ensure everyone can live as their authentic selves.” “Nobody should face harassment or discrimination based on their natural hair, and the CROWN Act is an effort to heal a systemic bias that tells Black people that who they inherently are is wrong,” said Senator Booker. “Prejudice against Black hair demeans an important foundation of our identity and cultural heritage. It’s time that the long and storied history of implicit and explicit biases against natural hair comes to an end. Black hair is beautiful in all of its forms and styles, and we must ensure individuals are free to express their cultural identities without fear of prejudice or bias.” “There is a longstanding history of racial discrimination against natural hair and protective styles in the workplace, schools, and society at large. Purportedly race-neutral grooming policies that reinforce Eurocentric standards of beauty and myopic notions of what constitute professional hair are problematic. To that end, since 2018, I have worked tirelessly to pass the CROWN Act and shift culture to mitigate the physical, psychological, and economic harm caused by race-based hair discrimination,” said Dr. Adjoa B. Asamoah who is the scholar and strategist leading the nationwide CROWN Act movement. “We must work collectively to protect our children, like Darryl George, and ensure they have positive educational experiences. I am grateful for the partnership and leadership of Congresswoman Watson Coleman and Senator Booker.” “I am proud to stand with my colleagues Rep. Watson Coleman, Rep. Pressley, Rep. Omar, and Rep. Moore to reintroduce the CROWN Act,” said Rep. Barbara Lee. “Hair discrimination is rooted in systemic racism and is a real barrier to advancement and empowerment for people of color.\\xa0 For far too long, GOP dysfunction has blocked this legislation, but we will not relent until Black people can wear their natural hair however they see fit, without fear of discrimination. No one should feel forced to change who they are in order to secure a job or fair and decent housing.” “Hair discrimination is a reality that Black people face daily across America – in schools, workplaces, and public spaces,” said Rep. Ilhan Omar. “Natural hair textures and protective styles have unfairly subjected people to discrimination, missed opportunities, and humiliation. The CROWN Act draws a firm line, making it crystal clear that this form of race-based discrimination will not be tolerated. No one deserves to be judged or held back because of their hair texture or cultural hairstyle.” “In our country, Black women’s hair is 2.5x more likely to be perceived as unprofessional and over 20% of Black women have been sent home from work because of their hair. A student in my former PA House District was once told ‘change your hair or go home,’” said Rep. Summer Lee. “I was proud to introduce the CROWN Act during my time in Pennsylvania, and look forward to taking this fight in Congress–because it’s long past time to make respect for our beautiful Black hair the law of the land in this country.” “It’s 2024 and Black hair is still criminalized,” said Rep. Gwen Moore. “We need the CROWN Act to affirm that any person – no matter their hair texture or style – should be free to wear their hair as it grows out of their head without facing discrimination at work or school. I’m proud to wear my sister locs in Congress and I’m excited to partner on this bill with so many of my trailblazing colleagues.” “I applaud Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman and Senator Cory Booker for their leadership in reintroducing the CROWN Act to bring forward necessary change,” said Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus Steven Horsford. “For too long, race-based hair discrimination, which permeates every part of our society from the workplace to the classroom, has been historically used to shut off access to educational and employment opportunities for Black Americans. Students like Darryl George in Anahuac, Texas should not be barred from his classroom, and Black women all over our country should not be forced to change their hair to be accepted in the workplace. We must pass the CROWN Act on the national level to finally outlaw race-based hair discrimination.” “Racial discrimination can come in many different shapes and forms, with hair discrimination chief among them,” said Rep. Maxwell Frost. “No one should be discriminated against because of the color of their skin or the texture of their hair — but that’s exactly what’s happening in our country. In schools, in places of business, and beyond, folks with textured hair, mainly Black men and women, are finding themselves with the doors of opportunity closed to them simply because of their natural hair. Enough is enough. I’m proud to help introduce the CROWN Act alongside Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman to help us bring an end to this discrimination.” The CROWN Act, which has already been enacted in 23 states and dozens of cities nationwide, would help bring an end to race-based hair discrimination in schools and workplaces, removing a barrier to educational and economic opportunity facing many Black Americans and people of color. In the school setting, Black students are disciplined at a rate four times higher than any other racial or ethnic group, and research has found that 70 percent of all suspension disciplines are discretionary, many stemming from dress code violations, including “unapproved” hair styles. Meanwhile, in the workplace, bias against ethnic and natural hairstyles contributes to reduced opportunities for job advancement, particularly for women. Over 20% of young Black women have been sent home from work because of their hair. One-third of Black women under 34 believe they have been denied a job interview because of their hair. The CROWN Act passed the House of Representatives in 2019 and 2022 but was blocked in the Senate. The CROWN Act would: “Bravo to Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman for reintroducing the CROWN Act, which seeks to undo generations of systemic hair discrimination that’s done immeasurable harm to so many individuals,” said SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher.\\xa0“It’s time to end these discriminatory practices. I applaud lawmakers who push for the real change necessary to achieve equity in the workplace and public schools. An acceptance of the diversity of the human experience will be the greatest step towards peace on earth.” “As an advocate for equality and fairness in all aspects of society, APFA proudly endorses the CROWN Act, or the Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair Act,” said Julie Hedrick, National President of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA).\\xa0“The CROWN Act aims to end race-based discrimination because of hair texture or protective hairstyles. While already passed in some states and municipalities, the bill would provide critical federal-level protection for individuals who might otherwise be judged or penalized based on their natural hair texture or style. Flight Attendants, like all individuals, deserve a work environment free from bias and discrimination. APFA commends Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, representing the 12th district of New Jersey, for introducing the CROWN Act and we look forward to advocating for its passage. Together, we can work towards a future where everyone, regardless of their hairstyle, can feel valued, respected, and accepted in both the workplace and beyond.”“No one should be punished, harassed, or discriminated against for wearing a hairstyle that is reflective of themselves and their cultural heritage,” said Denise Forte, President and CEO of EdTrust. “Yet many Black students routinely face disciplinary consequences for their natural or ethnic hairstyles: 53% of Black mothers say their daughters experienced hair discrimination by age five; and 86% of Black teens\\xa0state they experienced hair discrimination by age 12. For example, a Houston-area high school student has been suspended since last August because of his locs. In a lawsuit, a Texas judge ruled in favor\\xa0of the school district, further codifying natural hair discrimination and shamelessly upholding standards of white supremacy.\\xa0The CROWN Act would help bring an end to race-based hair discrimination and allow for a more supportive school environment for students of color — particularly Black students, who bear the brunt of hair criminalization.”\\xa0“All students, no matter their race or place, deserve equal access to educational opportunities,” said National Education Association President Becky Pringle. “They deserve the right to be their true authentic selves without fear of subjective discipline or body shaming. However, too often, the same politicians who ban books and demonize transgender students want to tell Black girls what to wear and Black kids how to wear their hair. This small group of people in power is threatening the success of our students in school and beyond with their anti-Black hair policies. The National Education Association\\xa0applauds the introduction of the CROWN Act because it acknowledges that people of color in K-12 public schools, workplaces, housing, and public accommodations face hair-based discrimination, and the legislation creates consequences for those who are responsible for it. More to the point, we welcome the proposal’s attempt to expand federal protections to end hair discrimination nationwide. By joining across race and place, we can create real change and contribute to the movement to end hair discrimination and to ensure every student has access to a safe, welcoming public school free from discrimination where they can thrive into their brilliant selves.” In addition to Reps.

But the Antisemitism Awareness Act is no such answer. This inherently divisive bill not only undermines President Biden’s comprehensive and proven National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism, but creates dangerous opportunities for bad actors to attack free speech on an unprecedented scale. Make no mistake: Congress must take the rising scourge of antisemitism seriously and deliver decisive results that confront this crisis of hatred head on. Political ploys and patronization will never be the path forward. While the president’s strategy continues to deliver tangible differences in Jewish lives, Congress must pass meaningful legislation like the Countering Antisemitism Act that complements and supports President Biden’s work – not impede it at every turn.” ### \\n Sign Up for email updates from Congresswoman Yvette Clarke.',\n",

The bill passed by the House today will strengthen federal anti-discrimination laws with respect to antisemitism and improve safety and security for Jewish communities in South Jersey and across the country. \\xa0 “Congress sent a message to the nation today that we will not be silent or idle at a time when antisemitism and hatred is rearing its ugly head across our nation. We must and we will continue to stand against all forms of hatred, bigotry, and antisemitism.

       " 'Washington, DC—May 1, 2024…Congressman Steve Womack (AR-3) released the following statement after voting for H.R. 6090, the Antisemitism Awareness Act:\\n Congressman Womack said, “It infuriates me to see people cloaking themselves in our constitution while demeaning it with their actions. Pro-terror, antisemitic mobs have no place in this country. Yet we have seen the leadership at American universities cede to these radical mobs rather than honor their responsibility to ensure the safety and educational opportunities for students. The passage of this bill today is a step forward in combatting antisemitism on our college campuses and holding those who participate in political violence accountable.” Bill breakdown: H.R. 6090 seeks to combat the pro-terrorist, antisemitic protests taking over American college campuses by requiring the Department of Education to utilize the 2016 International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s (IHRA) definition of antisemitism and its contemporary examples when reviewing, investigating, or determining whether discrimination has occurred. It further expresses the sense of Congress that discrimination against Jews may violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 when it is based on race, color, or national origin, which can include discrimination based on actual or perceived shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics.

Clarke (NY-09) and Senator Peter Welch (D-VT) released the below statement following the\\xa0final notice\\xa0from FCC Chairwoman Rosenworcel on the nationwide impact of the official wind down of the Affordable Connectivity Program. “For over two years, the ACP has provided tens of millions of Americans in every corner of our nation with reliable, high-speed broadband at a price they can afford. According to the FCC, nearly 70 percent of these households had no or very limited internet access before the ACP. The end of this program would have devastating consequences. No family should have to choose between putting food on the table and having internet access essential for modern life. Congress must act swiftly, and pass the bipartisan Affordable Connectivity Program Extension Act. Lives, jobs, and futures are on the line. Congress must act now to protect this program – before it’s too late,”\\xa0said Rep. Clarke. “Access to high-speed internet has become a necessity in our everyday lives, from scheduling doctors’ appointments, to attending class, and doing your job. But for too many households, the cost of high-speed broadband has prevented them from getting connected,”\\xa0said Senator Welch, Member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Technology.\\xa0“In the two years since its creation, the ACP has been instrumental in helping nearly 23 million households including families, students, veterans, and seniors stay connected to their work, school, and doctors. But right now, we’re at the end of the line–Congress must pass our bipartisan Affordable Connectivity Program Extension Act to prevent millions of people across the country from falling into digital darkness.” The\\xa0Affordable Connectivity Program Extension Act\\xa0was introduced by Reps. Clarke and Fitzpatrick (PA-01) who were joined by original cosponsors Reps. Michael Lawler (NY-17), Norma Torres (CA-35), Anthony D’Esposito (NY-04), Debbie Dingell (MI-6), Darren Soto (FL-9), and Marc Molinaro (NY-19), along with 217 additional cosponsors. U.S. Senators Peter Welch (D-Vt.) and JD Vance (R-Ohio) are leading the legislation in the Senate. The\\u202fAffordable Connectivity Program Extension Act\\u202fis supported by over\\u202f400 organizations,\\xa0including: AARP, American Civil Liberties Union, AT&T, Charter, Comcast, Communications Workers of America, Cox Communications, CTIA – The Wireless Association, INCOMPAS, NAACP, NCTA – The Internet & Television Association, NTCA – The Rural Broadband Association, T-Mobile, USTelecom, Verizon, Wireless Infrastructure Association, and WTA – Advocates for Rural Broadband. Read more about the bill\\xa0here\\xa0and see state-by-state data on the ACP\\xa0here. Due to a lack of funding, the Federal Communications Commission began\\xa0winding down the program\\xa0in January 2024. April was the last month households received the full $30 discount. In May, some may receive a partial discount, but without action from Congress, the ACP will end after May 2024. The Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) is a lifeline for millions, but its future hangs in the balance.

The planned walkout would have undoubtedly exacerbated the pain of the Jewish community - which includes many students, faculty, and staff at Eastern High School. \\xa0 \\xa0 “It cannot go without saying that while I understand the significant concerns about the ongoing loss of life in Gaza, the fact is that Hamas is solely responsible for it. Not only did these terrorists attack Israel, killing children and raping women, but the group also continues to hold 133 Israeli hostages and has repeatedly rejected proposals to release them in exchange for a ceasefire. At the same time, Hamas leadership promises to attack Israel again if it is able and continues to use a mantra of ‘death to Jews.’ \\xa0 “I am also concerned about the dark turn much of the public rhetoric has taken. Too many of our Jewish neighbors not only feel threatened - they have been threatened. That is unacceptable. Antisemitic rhetoric and actions cannot be allowed and speech that causes fear and promotes hate based on identity or religion should never be embraced, especially in our public schools. It is encouraging that this event was reconsidered and I urge everyone to find ways to support all our students.” \\xa0 Rep. Norcross was a part of the first congressional delegation visit to Israel in the days following the October 7 attack. \\xa0 Rep. Norcross, Sen.\\xa0Joni Ernst (R-IA), and a bipartisan, bicameral congressional delegation returned to the Middle East in early January to reaffirm support for Israel, meet with regional officials and partners about challenges, and advocate for the safe and secure return of U.S. citizens taken hostage by Hamas. He also led an op-ed with\\xa0Sen. Ernst\\xa0on the important role that Congress has in bringing the hostages home. \\xa0 In March, Rep. Norcross welcomed\\xa0Yael Alexander, the mother of New Jerseyan Edan Alexander who remains held hostage by Hamas, as his State of the Union guest to highlight the continued hostage crisis. \\xa0 ### Permalink: https://norcross.house.gov/2024/4/rep-norcross-statement-on-the-planned-pro-palestinian-walkout-at-eastern-regional-high-school',\n",

WASHINGTON, DC – Yesterday, as National Minority Health Month concluded, Congresswoman Kathy Castor (FL-14), co-chair of the Congressional Academic Medicine Caucus, and Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (OH-03), co-chair of the Congressional Black Caucus’ Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Task Force, introduced a resolution recognizing the importance of DEI in medical education. The resolution affirms the need for a health care workforce that mirrors the nation’s diverse patient populations to advance health equity throughout the United States. To that end, the resolution commits to supporting DEI programs and academic freedom at medical education institutions. Unequal access to quality medical services, treatment, and preventive measures has led to significant disparities in health outcomes, life expectancy, and overall well-being among racial and ethnic groups. As a result, certain communities face higher rates of health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and asthma. Ample evidence suggests that diversity at medical schools, and therefore in the field of medicine, increases access to care for medically underserved communities and improves patient-provider interactions and quality of care.\\xa0 The historical lack of diversity in medicine underscores the need for DEI initiatives. A recent survey by the Association of American Medical Colleges revealed that only 7% of practicing U.S. physicians identified as Hispanic and 6% as Black or African American. Therefore, the resolution promotes efforts to foster diversity at medical education institutions and strongly opposes legislative measures that threaten these efforts. “The health and well-being of all Americans depends on medical professionals who understand and respond to the needs of their diverse patients. Understanding biases, racial discrimination, and historic barriers to diagnosis and care are vital parts of medical education and training today. A highly-competent and diverse health care workforce helps avoid mistreatment and close the gaps in health disparities,” said Congresswoman Castor. “As Co-Chair of the Congressional Academic Medicine Caucus, I value graduate medical physician training that emphasizes culturally-competent care for patients from a variety of backgrounds so that patients feel respected, safe and understood, and receive the high quality care they need. Rep. Beatty’s strong leadership in support of a robust and diverse medical workforce is vital at a time when some seek to dismiss the role that diversity, equity and inclusion play in positive patient outcomes and the quality of health care delivered.” “Attempts to stymie diversity in medical education and training prioritize intolerance over innovation and only serve to worsen the health disparities that persist in this country. This tactic legislates a political narrative instead of engaging in an evidence-based debate, suppressing meaningful academic discourse and perpetuating systemic barriers to health equity,” said Congresswoman Beatty. “Research has conclusively proven that diversity in medicine leads directly to greater access to health care and better health outcomes for all Americans. With the endorsement of several medical organizations, I am proud to introduce this resolution alongside Congresswoman Castor to unequivocally support, defend, and embrace diversity, equity, and inclusion in medical education in the face of baseless efforts to eliminate these core pillars.” “Medical schools are in the best position to identify how to prepare their students to meet the needs of the physician workforce and must have the autonomy and flexibility to do so,” said David J. Skorton, MD, President and CEO of the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC). “When a medical school recognizes the benefits associated with cultivating student belonging—fostering educational benefits associated with all types of diversity, ensuring equal educational opportunities for their students, and providing instruction on evidence-based knowledge they deem to be fundamental—it is within their purview and their responsibility to pursue those efforts.”',\n",

Nearly every committee here has a role to play in these efforts to stop the madness that has ensued. The federal government plays a critical role in higher education, and we will use all the tools available to us to address this scourge.” \\xa0 Education and Workforce Committee Chairwoman Virginia Foxx: “No stone must go unturned while buildings are being defaced. Campus greens are being captured, or graduations are being ruined. College is not a park for play acting juveniles or a battleground for radical activist. Everyone affiliated with these universities will receive a healthy dose of reality. Actions have consequences.” \\xa0 Science, Space and Technology Committee Chairman Frank Lucas: “Universities that can’t protect their students are not in compliance with their funding obligations through the National Science Foundation …As a part of the conditions of receiving taxpayer dollars through the NSF, universities must comply with Title Six of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin…It’s time we review whether universities that allow the harassment, assault or intimidation, other Jewish students are in compliance with their federal obligations.” \\xa0 Energy and Commerce Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers:\\xa0“The Energy and Commerce Committee oversees agencies that dole out massive amounts of taxpayer funded research grants… We will be increasing our oversight of institutions that have received public funding and cracking down on those who are in violation of the Civil Rights Act.” \\xa0 Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan: “On\\xa0September 30, 2021, Secretary Mayorkas issued his guidelines for immigration enforcement.\\xa0He said\\xa0that national security threats are a reason to remove people from this country.\\xa0The\\xa0overriding question is simple: Are individuals advocating for the destruction of our dearest and closest ally, the State of Israel,\\xa0engaged in this anti-Semitic behavior?\\xa0And is that a national security threat? We think it is and we think the American people deserve answers.” \\xa0 Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith: “At the Ways and Means Committee, we have been investigating the issue for months in a hearing last November, we examined the nexus between antisemitism tax exempt universities and terror financing networks…We’ve sent letters to university leaders demanding information on what disciplinary action, if any, that they have taken against those whose antisemitic activity violates campus policy. We’ve called on them to disclose any donations or funding they have received from foreign governments as well. Our investigation has already produced more than 1,500 pages of documents that we are now actively reviewing.” \\xa0 Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer: “These radical protests threatening violence against Jews are anything but organic. It appears global elites are funding these hateful protests and pop-up tent cities. These are the same groups that fund other radical agendas, including diminishing America’s energy production and pushing soft on crime policies that harm the American people. The House Oversight Committee will follow the money trail, expose it to the American people and seek to hold bad actors funding hate accountable.” \\xa0 ### \\n\\nTags: \\n Tweet\\n Share\\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tH-232, The Capitol\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWashington, D.C. 20515\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t202-225-4000\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t ©2024 U.S. House of Representatives.

       " 'FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE |\\xa0Contact: Olivia Porcaro 202-225-6165 Over the weekend, 27 tornadoes ripped through Oklahoma, resulting in widespread devastation and heartbreaking loss of life.  My thoughts and prayers are with those who have been affected by or are grieving as a result of these severe tornadoes. I would also like to thank our first responders who have been on the ground responding so nobly over the past couple of days.  As the Representative for Oklahomans in the fourth district, I know that my place this week is in Oklahoma, not Washington, D.C. – and I am currently on my way back home to assess the damage and ensure my constituents get the necessary assistance they need. However, in the meantime, I want to provide those affected with some immediate resources:  Reporting Damage  It is necessary for the state of Oklahoma to complete damage assessments before the Governor submits his request for disaster declaration to the President. It is very important that Oklahomans submit their damage reports, in order for the state to know where to send teams to evaluate the damage, and, in turn, make the appropriate request to the Executive.  To report damage, click here.  Public Shelters   The American Red Cross has opened a storm shelter in Sulphur, Oklahoma. It is located at Crossway Church. The address is 2108 W. Broadway Avenue. Additionally, the Murray County Sherrif’s Office designated the Crossway Church as a reunification center for those who are searching for their missing loved ones.  The Red Cross also opened another shelter in Ardmore at the Christ Community Church, which is located at 2620 Mount Washington Road.  Price Gouging Law  The Emergency Price Stabilization Act is currently in place in the twelve counties that were hit by the storms. This law prohibits unfair price hikes for necessary goods and services during this time of need.\\xa0   If you experience contractor fraud or more than a ten percent increase for the price of goods and services, call the Oklahoma Attorney General’s Consumer Protection Unit at 833-681-1895.  Power Outages  According to Oklahoma Gas and Electric, over 13,000 customers lost power this weekend. In a statement, the company said it will be a “multi-day restoration event.”  To report and monitor outages:  Insurance Claims  The Oklahoma Insurance Department (OID) is available and ready to help Oklahomans with any difficulties they are experiencing with their insurance claims. Visit OID’s website here or call them at 800-522-0071.  Mass Care  Oklahoma Southern Baptist Relief has two chainsaw teams in Morris and a mass feeding kitchen on the way to Sulphur to provide meals.  Critical Incident Stress Management-trained chaplains are also available for those affected, as well as first responders.  The Salvation Army is giving out meals to first responders, as well as determining the need for clean-up kits and other critical supplies.  Non-Emergency Information  For Oklahomans that need non-emergency or health and human service information, dial 2-1-1 from your phone. 2-1-1 services are available 24 hours a day. E-mail Me',\n",
       " 'April 30, 2024 “The truth is that America needs DEI to disrupt systems of oppression that are active in every facet of our society.” “DEI initiatives are how we combat white supremacy, antisemitism, ableism, sexism, transphobia, and more.” Video (YouTube) WASHINGTON\\xa0– Today, in a House Oversight Committee hearing, Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) slammed Republicans’ coordinated assault on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, and underscored the importance of DEI initiatives to combatting white supremacy, antisemitism, ableism, sexism, transphobia, and other forms of discrimination. Rep. Pressley also touted a pair of bills she introduced this month with Oversight Committee Ranking Member Jamie Raskin, which would codify equity across federal agencies and improve government services for underserved communities. A transcript of the Congresswoman’s question line is available below and the full video is available here. Transcript: Pressley Slams GOP Assault on DEI, Touts Bill to Codify Equity Across Federal AgenciesHouse Committee on Oversight and AccountabilityApril 30, 2024 REP. PRESSLEY: Thank you, Mr. Miller, for joining us today. I want to take a moment to discuss the critical importance of DEI work.\\xa0 My colleagues across the aisle have waged an all-out war on diversity, equity, and inclusion. I am not sure if it’s that they just hate one aspect of it, like diversity, or if it’s the combination of all three.\\xa0 Regardless, this Republican majority has demonstrated it’s out of touch with the priorities of everyday people and has focused its effort on passing legislation and budgets to undermine DEI and entrench systemic discrimination against people of color, folks with disabilities, and other marginalized groups. Republicans sought to defund the Office of Civil Rights in the Department of Education, which is essential to confronting the rise in antisemitism and islamophobia impacting our students.\\xa0 Republicans voted to stop the hiring of DEI personnel in the military, despite evidence that it will improve military readiness. And Republicans consistently use harmful rhetoric, at every opportunity, to undermine the talent, knowledge, skills, and the training of professionals in every sector where DEI initiatives exist. And they often pervert, mischaracterize, and weaponize the words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., despite the fact that his children, his surviving children, have repeatedly asked them to cease and desist from doing so. It is no surprise that the same people complaining about DEI are the same people who complained about the Me Too movement, about Black Lives Matter, about the ERA, about the gay rights movement, and so much more.\\xa0 The fact that as soon as someone who is Black or gay or has a disability earns a promotion, Republicans complain that they are unqualified and begin ranting about how diversity, equity, and inclusion is ruining the country. It’s shameful. It’s untrue. It’s discriminatory. And we must not back down in our efforts to create a nation that respects all people.\\xa0\\xa0 Might I add that the opposition is majority, overwhelmingly white and male. Now, President Biden signed a historic executive order on his first day in office to take a whole-of-government approach that embodies equity in the Administration’s work to ensure all people benefit, not just the wealthy and well-connected.\\xa0 Mr. Miller, the Office of Management and Budget plays an outsized role in implementing and overseeing the executive orders on equity. Can you explain why equity is an important part of performance goals, performance goals, for agencies? MR. MILLER: Thank you Congresswoman, and there is a phrase that you used that is central to explaining it. It’s that government should work for all Americans.\\xa0 So one example of something that we are doing is around accessibility associated with government services. We have many government digital websites and services where it’s hard for some people, including disabled individuals, to access those government services and we’re working to improve that.\\xa0 Our services aren’t working if they’re not serving all of America. REP. PRESSLEY:\\xa0Very good. I agree. What is an example of how President Biden’s executive order on equity has helped folks across the country? MR. MILLER:\\xa0Well, one of the things that we have done is to broaden, and discussed in this hearing, the way in which we are utilizing federal financial assistance to reach more broadly into communities, to improve performance of the dollars to make sure that community-based organizations that might otherwise not have applied for federal funds are able to access those funds and better deliver because they are better — they are closer to those in their community. That means better results, that means more efficiency, and frankly, that means less waste on useless overhead. REP. PRESSLEY:\\xa0Thank you. The Executive Order, this is truly a first-of-its-kind. I am proud to partner with Ranking Member Raskin on legislation to codify key aspects into law so that they will exist in perpetuity.\\xa0 The truth is that America needs DEI to disrupt systems of oppression that are active in every facet of our society. DEI initiatives are how we combat white supremacy, antisemitism, ableism, sexism, transphobia, and more. In the face of the opposition, I applaud those who are committed to doing this work, from college presidents, corporate executives, to community organizers and academic researchers. And to those who are against DEI, I would love to know, really, what you are so afraid of. What are you so threatened by?\\xa0 Thank you and I yield back. ### Washington DC Office 402 Cannon HOB\\r\\nWashington, DC 20515 Phone (202) 225-5111\\r\\nFax (202) 225-9322 District Office 1295 River Street\\r\\nHyde Park, MA 02136 Phone (617) 850-0040\\r\\nFax (202) 225-9322',\n",

The country’s real estate market is in free-fall, its population\\xa0sank\\xa0by 2 million people in 2023, and its stock markets have\\xa0lost\\xa0roughly $7 trillion since 2021. Numerous countries are cooperating multilaterally to take countermeasures against what they view as the CCP’s military and economic aggression. Xi’s grip on his rule is secure for the moment, but he is confronting unprecedented challenges to his leadership. Fundamentally, Xi faces a dilemma over China’s future. He and his government must decide whether to continue to prioritize increasing security and centralizing his control over the country, chilling the animal spirits of entrepreneurship in the process, or to loosen his control over the country and reduce aggression toward his neighbors, allowing for greater growth and prosperity. It is highly unlikely that he will choose the latter—and we in the United States must now begin to ready ourselves for potential challenges. Although the latest official economic\\xa0statistics\\xa0show China hitting its growth targets, those figures often reflect CCP narratives more than reality, and other indicators show that China’s economic state is precarious at best. Some\\xa0outside analysts\\xa0put China’s actual GDP growth as low as 1.5 percent in 2023. The country has lost at least\\xa0$4.7 trillion\\xa0in housing wealth since its market\\xa0peaked\\xa0in 2021.\\xa0Other market indicators offer no hope for a rapid recovery, as the housing sector has just reported its worst performance ever recorded for both\\xa0new\\xa0and\\xa0existing\\xa0housing sales, while new construction has declined by a record\\xa060 percent\\xa0compared to pre-pandemic levels. After defaulting on more than\\xa0$100 billion\\xa0in international bonds over the past 4 years, China’s largest developers have either collapsed or survive only through government support. Injections of foreign capital have not helped to close the gap. Foreign direct investment into China is at its\\xa0lowest point\\xa0in three decades. China’s stock markets are down by nearly\\xa020 percent\\xa0over the past year. While stocks are relatively unimportant to Chinese household savings, public wealth is\\xa0overwhelmingly tied up in real estate. Major players—such as Evergrande, Vanke, and Country Garden—are teetering on the brink of collapse as property prices continue to fall despite the government’s best efforts to prop them up. The situation could grow far worse as the country approaches a potential deflationary crisis following the\\xa0largest drop\\xa0in consumer prices in 15 years. All this comes as the country faces the beginning of its\\xa0demographic free-fall, during which an aging Chinese population may\\xa0decline\\xa0by as much as 100 million people by 2050. Since the beginning of former leader Deng Xiaoping’s reform and opening, the CCP has sold China’s economic growth as a key pillar of its legitimacy. Many in the party still recognize the importance of solving these economic challenges to its legitimacy and control. One important way out is foreign direct investment. Some in the CCP are eager to court U.S. capital and reassure U.S. investors that China remains a hospitable market for doing business. At the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit last November, Xi\\xa0dined with\\xa0U.S. business leaders and emphasized that “China is ready to be a partner and friend of the United States, and there is plenty of room for bilateral cooperation.” However, despite Xi’s rhetoric, the actions of the Chinese government do not line up with creating a hospitable business environment for U.S. and other foreign companies. China has been steadily tightening its national security and data protection laws at the expense of businesses being able to conduct due diligence, market research, or otherwise normal operations. Earlier this year, the Chinese government\\xa0broadened\\xa0the scope of its state secrets law, making it even more difficult for businesses to provide information for foreign investors and stakeholders. Even more chilling is the\\xa0detainment\\xa0of business leaders; in 2023, many top Chinese executives from technology, finance, and real estate companies were detained or went missing. This threat is not limited to Chinese executives, as foreigners have\\xa0faced exit bans. The Chinese military’s increasingly aggressive actions in Taiwan also rattle U.S.-based and other foreign businesses. The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has steadily\\xa0increased incursions\\xa0into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone, and in September 2023, there was a\\xa0record number\\xa0of PLA aircraft around Taiwanese airspace in one day. In the event of an invasion of Taiwan, the United States and other Group of Seven countries would likely impose severe\\xa0economic sanctions,\\xa0and estimates of the damage to the global economy are in the\\xa0trillions of dollars. Companies do not want to become caught in the crossfire. Yet Xi seems willing to contemplate taking these risks for his ambition of controlling Taiwan. Xi now faces a fundamental dilemma in balancing his country’s prosperity and his party’s level of control. Despite the importance of maintaining economic growth for his popular support, Xi has consistently prioritized control ahead of his people’s prosperity. As Xi wrestles with this choice, we and others—including the Chinese people—must hope for the best while continuing to prepare for the worst.',\n",

       " 'For Immediate Release Contact: Taylor Haulsee \\xa0 \\xa0 NEW YORK CITY\\xa0—\\xa0At a press conference on the steps of the Low Memorial Library at Columbia University, Speaker Johnson denounced the inexcusable treatment of Jewish students on Columbia’s campus and called for University President Minouche Shafik to resign if she can’t bring an immediate end to the chaos. \\xa0 Click here to watch the press conference \\xa0 “Sadly, Columbia’s administrators have chosen to let the threats, the fear, and the intimidation of the mob rule to overtake American principles like free speech and the free exchange of ideas and the free exercise of religion,” Speaker Johnson said. “They have co-opted First Amendment arguments to protect genocide and to elevate the voices of antisemitism. They have proven themselves to be incapable of achieving their basic responsibility, which is keeping students safe. We just can’t allow this kind of hatred and any antisemitism to flourish on our campuses, and it must be stopped in its tracks.” \\xa0 Prior to the press conference, Speaker Johnson met with Jewish students from Columbia alongside Rabbi Yuda Drizin. “We just left a meeting with Jewish students who told us of the heinous acts of bigotry that they have experienced simply because of their faith,” Speaker Johnson said. “Their bravery is inspiring, much more inspiring than some of the activities we’re seeing here. They should never have to confront such hate on an American college campus at such a revered institution.” \\xa0 Speaker Johnson was joined at the press conference by Education and Workforce Committee Chairwoman Virginia Foxx, Rep. Anthony D’Esposito, \\xa0Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, and Rep. Mike Lawler. \\xa0 Rep. Foxx: “So, I have a message, President Shafik, and a message for you all too. The inmates are running the asylum. Take back control of this once great institution. You took action last week, it’s time to act again. If not, the committee will pursue every possible avenue to create a safe learning environment for Jewish students.\\xa0“ \\xa0 Rep. D’Esposito: “If you are a protester on this campus, and you are proud that you’ve been endorsed by Hamas, you are part of the problem. When you cheer on the fact that you enjoy Hamas and Hezbollah, you are yourself part of the problem. Mr. Speaker, I’m proud to join with you here today in calling for the immediate resignation of the President of Columbia. She has failed her duty. She is not keeping students safe.” \\xa0 Rep. Malliotakis: “It is truly outrageous, and it’s clear that the president of this university cannot control the campus, she cannot and will not hold students who are doing these types of antisemitic activities accountable, and that she cannot keep the students who are of Jewish faith – who, who have paid a lot of money and have worked very hard to get to an Ivy League institution like this – that she cannot keep them safe. And that is why I joined my colleagues in calling for her resignation.” \\xa0 Rep. Lawler: “I want Palestinians to be free too, from their oppressor, Hamas. And every single one of you students that support Hamas are an absolute abomination. …If you want a ceasefire, the fastest way for a ceasefire to occur is for Hamas to surrender and to release the hostages.\\xa0And if you can’t call for that, you are a pathetic embarrassment to this institution and to students everywhere. It is time for President Shafik to resign in disgrace.” \\xa0 Read Speaker Johnson’s full remarks below: \\xa0 “We’re here today at one of America’s preeminent academic institutions on a very important day in a very important time. Throughout history, Columbia students have contributed to the great storybook of America’s life and thought. Visionary American leaders like Alexander Hamilton and John Jay and the Jewish leader Gershom Seixas knew the self-evident truth that was at the heart of this country, and once, at the heart of this university. And that is that we are endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights. They should not be infringed. \\xa0 “The founders and the great leaders who had come through this institution in the past believed in religious liberty. They believed in democracy. They believed in morality and virtue and the dignity of every human person. They believed in the free exchange of ideas, and they detested mob rule. \\xa0 “We are standing here right now in the steps of the Low Library. In this very building right behind us, Columbia University once awarded Winston Churchill in an honorary degree, and it was Churchill who said, “It is manifestly right that Jews should have a national home where they may be reunited.” We believe in that principle, and today I’m here to proclaim to all those who gnash their teeth and demand to wipe the state of Israel off the map and attack our innocent Jewish students, this simple truth: neither Israel, nor these Jewish students on this campus, will ever stand alone. \\xa0 “Today, Hamas issued an endorsement statement of the protestors on this campus. They called them the future leaders of America. It is detestable. All of this has to be said because the cherished traditions of this university are being overtaken right now by radical and extreme ideologies. They place a target on the backs of Jewish students in the United States, and here on this campus, a growing number of students have chanted in support of terrorists. They have chased down Jewish students. They have mocked them and reviled them. They have shouted racial epithets. They have screamed at those who bear the star of David. \\xa0 “They have told Jewish students who wear the star of David to leave the country and shamefully some professors and faculty have joined the mobs. Things have gotten so out of control that the school has canceled in-person classes, and now they’ve come up with this hybrid model where they will discriminate against Jewish students. They’re not allowed to come to class anymore for fear of their lives. And it’s detestable. \\xa0 “As Columbia has allowed these lawless agitators and radicals to take over, the virus of antisemitism is spread across other campuses. By some counts, as many as 200 universities have a similar form of protest. Right now at Yale, a Jewish student was stabbed in the eye with a Palestinian flag and 45 students were arrested. At NYU, Pro-Hamas protestors were shouting from the ‘river to the sea.’ Anti-Israel encampments are popping up at universities all across this country. \\xa0 “The madness has to stop. We just left a meeting with Jewish students who told us of the heinous acts of bigotry that they have experienced simply because of their faith. Their bravery is inspiring, much more inspiring than some of the activities we’re seeing here. They should never have to confront such hate on an American college campus at such a revered institution. \\xa0 “Antisemitism has been growing in America and it’s clear why. Powerful people have refused to condemn it, and some have even peddled it themselves. From university professors to public officials, people in positions of authority have denied the horrific facts of September 11th, 2001, the attacks on the United States. That happened right here in New York City, and they’ve attempted to excuse or to ignore the barbaric attack of Hamas in Israel on October 7th, 2023. Where Israeli women and children were savagely raped and murdered, and infants were cooked in ovens. \\xa0 “Crowds of radical left activists have chanted death to America, and on our own streets in this country, and some public officials have refused to condemn them. Others have openly defended these acts on campus and the harassing and the intimidation and the threatening of innocent Jewish students simply because of who they are. They’ve called that peaceful protest, and some have even gone as far as calling for the state of Israel to be eliminated. These are words we expect from Ayatollahs in Iran, not American lawmakers, and not American students. And unsurprisingly, it has given way to threats and violence in a generation of students don’t feel safe in their own classrooms or where they live or where they worship. Let me say this very simply, no American of any color or creed should ever have to live under those kinds of threats. That is not who we are in this country. \\xa0 “Sadly, Columbia’s administrators have chosen to let the threats, the fear, and the intimidation of the mob rule to overtake American principles like free speech and the free exchange of ideas and the free exercise of religion. They have co-opted First Amendment arguments to protect genocide and to elevate the voices of antisemitism. They have proven themselves to be incapable of achieving their basic responsibility, which is keeping students safe. We just can’t allow this kind of hatred and any antisemitism to flourish on our campuses, and it must be stopped in its tracks. Those who are perpetrating this violence should be arrested. \\xa0 “And I’m here today joining my colleagues in calling on President Shafik to resign if she cannot immediately bring order to this chaos. As Speaker of the House, I’m committing today that the Congress will not be silent. As Jewish students are expected to run for their lives and stay home from their classes hiding in fear. In the House of Representatives, we’ve already acted to address antisemitism on campuses. We have passed a number of statutes to address this matter, and we call upon the US Senate to act upon our legislation.” \\xa0 ### \\xa0 \\n\\nTags: \\n Tweet\\n Share\\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tH-232, The Capitol\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWashington, D.C. 20515\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t202-225-4000\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t ©2024 U.S. House of Representatives.

       " 'The crisis along our southern border rages on because President Biden and Congressional Democrats are not taking it seriously. Throughout this Congress, I have continually fought to end President Biden’s open border policies. On May 11, 2023, I joined my House colleagues in voting to pass H.R. 2, the Secure the Border Act. This bill is the strongest border security measure to pass either chamber of Congress in modern history. This bill has been sitting on Chuck Schumer’s desk for nearly a year. On Saturday, the House had the opportunity to pass meaningful border security and sadly Democrats again rejected this measure. H.R. 3602, the End the Border Catastrophe Act, would resume border wall construction, increase the number of Border Patrol agents, reinstate the Remain in Mexico policy, and end catch-and-release policies, all very similar to provisions in H.R. 2. Additionally, this measure added language to reimburse states for costs they have incurred attempting to secure the border because the Biden Administration failed to do so. Unfortunately, while House Republicans supported this commonsense measure, the bill failed to get the two-thirds vote required to pass as a suspension. All but five Democrats voted against this effort to secure the border. Since President Biden took office, there have been 9.2 million encounters of individuals attempting to illegally enter our country with over 7.6 million of those encounters happening along our southern border. On top of that astronomical number, there have been over 1.8 million known gotaways, meaning individuals who illegally entered the U.S. and were not stopped by border patrol. Last month alone, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) recorded 189,372 encounters at the southwest border. This includes an individual from Lebanon who admitted to being a Hezbollah terrorist and having intentions of making a bomb. President Biden refuses to address this crisis, and Senate Democrats refuse to help House Republicans legislatively force his hand. Border security is a matter of national security, and we must act immediately.

       " 'Every April, we celebrate Second Chance Month, an opportunity to remember those in our community who are reentering society after involvement in the criminal justice system and consider the unique obstacles they face. America is the land of opportunity and second chances. Previously incarcerated individuals who take accountability for their actions and improve their lives should be able to count on our support. Approximately\\xa0600,000 people\\xa0are released from state and federal prisons each year. Upon release, many of these folks do not have basic resources like a savings account, a driver’s license, a primary care provider, or a job. The latest large scale and long-term recidivism study conducted by the Department of Justice’s Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS)\\xa0reported\\xa0that “66 percent of prisoners were arrested within three years and, 82 percent were arrested within ten years.” Another\\xa0BJS study\\xa0tracked employment for over 51,000 individuals released from federal prisons in 2010. One-third of those individuals were not employed at all during that four-year period. I firmly believe that one of the most impactful things we can do to help these individuals break the cycle of crime and violence is to help connect them to a good job. I have seen firsthand how a chance at employment can help turn a life around. Prior to serving in Congress, I owned and operated a construction firm, which participated in work release programs and was successful in helping those individuals find full-time employment. Holding down a job is a key aspect of reconnecting justice-involved individuals with their larger communities. It gives individuals a sense of purpose, reaffirms their self-worth, and brings stability to their families. We have a strong federal tool, the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), that we can use to improve federal efforts to assist these individuals in finding a job. WIOA provides the framework for the nation’s workforce development programs and focuses on helping eligible workers connect with the training they need to reskill and upskill to meet the needs of our economy. WIOA is overdue for reauthorization, and the U.S. House of Representatives recently\\xa0passed legislation\\xa0that would inject new funds into the program and implement measures to ensure training leads to family-sustaining jobs for workers. This reauthorization package included my\\xa0bill, the Workforce Reentry Act, legislation which would prompt innovation and improvement in the reentry of justice-involved individuals into the workforce through competitive grants, rigorous evaluation, and the dissemination of best practices. Since 2005, the Department of Labor has been operating the loosely structured Reentry Employment Opportunities program, awarding funding to organizations providing mentoring, job training, and case management services. However, independent evaluations have\\xa0found\\xa0this haphazard approach has produced minimal impacts on recidivism and labor market outcomes. My bill would codify the Reentry Employment Opportunities program and implement several reforms to ensure that we are pursuing evidence-based approaches that will connect eligible individuals with employers in their communities in in-demand industries. Moreover, grantees will be held to rigorous performance outcomes on participants’ employment, earnings, and credential attainment. This will give participants the assurance that the WIOA training they receive, prior to and after their release from prison, will lead them to stable employment that can sustain them in the days, weeks, months, and years after their reentry. The U.S. House of Representatives’ WIOA reauthorization package, A Stronger Workforce for America Act, is transformational legislation that is strengthened by the provision to codify and renew the Reentry Employment Opportunities program. I call on the U.S. Senate to take up this legislation without delay so that thousands of reentering citizens can have access to lifechanging workforce development programs. While the observation of Second Chance Month will soon come to a close, let’s commit ourselves all year to make good on our promise to Americans with experience in the justice system and offer them the best tool we can for success: a stable job. These opportunities will lead to sustainable career paths and give these individuals and their families a true second chance. Rep.

       " \" April 29, 2024 The Honorable Mike JohnsonSpeaker, U.S. House of RepresentativesH-232, The Capitol I write with respect to the need to urgently consider comprehensive legislation designed to address the dangerous rise in antisemitism across America. In May of 2023, President Joe Biden released the first-ever U.S. National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism, which outlines important executive action taken by the administration and makes legislative recommendations at every level of government. Quite disturbingly, subsequent to the release of the Biden administration’s strategic blueprint and in the aftermath of the heinous October 7 attack by Hamas, antisemitic incidents have risen to historic levels. Other than taking up resolutions that are symbolically meaningful, the House has failed to consider comprehensive legislation to combat antisemitism. We have a moral obligation to do much more. To that end, the Co-Chairs of the House and Senate Bipartisan Task Forces for Combating Antisemitism, including Representatives Kathy Manning and Chris Smith, introduced bipartisan legislation in early April that addresses the crisis of antisemitism and aggressively confronts the startling threats against Jewish people in America. The Countering Antisemitism Act would strengthen efforts to combat antisemitism in the U.S. and implement policies designed to keep Jewish communities safe. It supports implementation of the National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism and helps make its policies permanent. H.R. 7921 establishes a National Coordinator in the White House to oversee a new Interagency Task Force to Counter Antisemitism focused on combating domestic antisemitism and ensuring coordination among the federal agencies in fighting this terrible hatred. The legislation also requires the FEMA Administrator to guarantee the agency has the resources needed to operate the Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NGSP) which provides funding to synagogues, Jewish schools and other institutions for physical security enhancements. In the national security supplemental that Congress passed and the President signed into law last week, we included $400 million for the NGSP, underscoring this urgent need. In addition, this bill ensures the administration reports to Congress on implementation of federal strategies to combat antisemitism and designates a senior official to advise and oversee the Department of Education’s efforts to fight antisemitism on college campuses. There is nothing scheduled on the floor this week that would accomplish the concrete, thoughtful strategies outlined by the Biden administration, set forth in the legislation and echoed by leading Jewish organizations across the country.

       " 'April 25, 2024 One-Third of Federal and State Prisons Located Within Three Miles of Toxic Superfund Site\\xa0 Text of Resolution (PDF) BOSTON\\xa0– Following their March 29 visit to Massachusetts Correctional Institution-Norfolk, Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) and Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Clean Air, Climate, and Nuclear Safety introduced the Declaration of Environmental Rights for Incarcerated People. This resolution affirms the human right of nearly two million people currently incarcerated in the United States to a healthy and safe environment and to advocate for protecting and improving their environmental health. The resolution specifically recognizes decarceration as the principal strategy to address environmental health harms of criminal legal systems.\\xa0 “Everyone has a right to clean air, water and living environment, including people who are currently incarcerated,” said Rep. Pressley. “As we work to dismantle the racist and harmful system of mass incarceration, we must confront the environmental injustices that define carceral settings and affirm the human dignity of folks behind the wall. Proud to introduce this resolution in partnership with Senator Markey, advocates, and those closest to the pain.” “Our criminal legal system’s decision to put millions of people behind bars has torn apart families, destabilized communities, and allowed others to profit from mistreating other human beings,” said Senator Markey. “As we continue to fight for decarceration, we must also give currently incarcerated people the right to a healthy and safe environment. I look forward to continuing to lift up the voices of incarcerated individuals and ensure they have opportunities to work with lawmakers to translate their lived experiences into truly effective solutions.” “For persons with lived experience, this resolution marks the beginning of connecting the intersections between carceral states of being and humanizing incarcerated populations,” said Michael L. Mauney II, African American Coalition Committee Community Outreach Director and DeeperThanWater Coalition organizer. “The passing of this resolution would symbolize an effort to eradicate the exception clause mentioned in the Thirteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Incarcerated populations support efforts to humanize us and to decarcerate and end mass incarceration.” The lawmakers’ resolution would ensure such rights as: \\xa0 The resolution text was developed in partnership with the African American Coalition Committee and other incarcerated leaders at MCI-Norfolk. During Congresswoman Pressley’s and Senator Markey’s March 29 visit to the facility, incarcerated individuals shared testimonials of living through a water quality crisis that has gripped the facility since 2011.\\xa0\\xa0 Prisons and other carceral facilities greatly increase the exposure of incarcerated people, staff, and surrounding communities to toxic and dangerous conditions. These and other threats disproportionately harm vulnerable populations, including Black Americans, Indigenous people, Latine, and LGBTQ+ individuals, who are more likely to be incarcerated. The health impacts of incarceration are so severe that every year behind bars takes an average of two years off an individual’s life expectancy. The Declaration of Environmental Rights for Incarcerated Individuals is endorsed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the Prison Policy Initiative, Citizens United for Rehabilitation of Errants (CURE), and DeeperThanWater.\\xa0 “Environmental health and safety are critically important, both for incarcerated people and for those who work, volunteer, and visit in our nation’s prisons,” said David Fathi, Director of the American Civil Liberties Union National Prison Project. \\xa0“The Resolution is an important step toward ensuring environmental justice for all.”\\xa0 “We at Prison Policy Initiative strongly support a Declaration of Environmental Rights for Incarcerated People. This Declaration speaks to both the devastatingly real negative impacts of a hostile prison environment on an individual’s physical and mental health and the inalienable human right of people in prison to access clean water and air. We are proud to support this recognition of incarcerated people’s right to be free of a toxic environment,” said Sarah Staudt, Policy & Advocacy Director at the Prison Policy Initiative.\\xa0 “This resolution is a step in the right direction. \\xa0It will give criminal justice agencies, especially prisons, the obligation to rehabilitate,” said Charles Sullivan, Director of CURE.\\xa0 “We know that environmental injustice is one of the many things that make carceral settings toxic. Through that lens, this resolution makes clear that decarceration is the strongest and most important strategy we have to protect the rights of incarcerated people and to ensure that our communities are safe and healthy,” said Christine Mitchell, Sc.D., DeeperThanWater Coalition organizer.

Burgess, M.D. (R-TX), Chairman of the Budget Committee Health Care Task Force, joined House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington (R-TX) in sending a letter to Comptroller General Gene Dodaro of the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) requesting an investigation into the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) and its effect on the federal budget.\\n\\nClick HERE for the full letter.\\n\\nOn the costly effect of CMMI on the federal budget:\\n\\nIncreases in federal spending on health care in the United States—including Medicare and Medicaid—continue to exert significant pressure on the federal budget. At the same time, studies have found that higher levels of spending do not reliably lead to enhanced quality of care.\\n\\nIn 2010, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated CMMI would result in net savings of $1.3 billion over the ten-year budget window.

       " 'Recently I attended “Thunder in the Hills”, a play based off the infamous 1912 Carroll County Courthouse shootout, performed at the Courthouse. \\xa0 Carroll County and the nation were rocked by the March 14, 1912 shootout.\\xa0Newspapermen from all across the country flocked to the region to cover events.\\xa0Until the sinking of the Titanic, this was the nation’s top story. \\xa0 “The Courthouse Tragedy” emanated from a trial involving Floyd Allen, a descendant of one of the oldest families of Carroll County. Floyd had accosted a Carroll County Deputy officer attempting to turn in two of Floyd’s nephews. \\xa0 Upon Allen’s conviction, bedlam erupted in the Carroll County Courthouse. Dozens of bullets flew inside the courtroom. The community and the Commonwealth could not believe what had happened. \\xa0 The shootout claimed five lives, including a Judge, the Commonwealth’s Attorney and Sheriff.  \\xa0 Some members of the so-called “Allen Clan” were taken into custody quickly and tried. Sidna Allen and his nephew would be captured six months later in Iowa. Floyd and his son, Claude, were executed.\\xa0 Sidna Allen was sentenced to thirty-five years (in 1926, he was pardoned). \\xa0 To this day, people from all over Virginia and the country remain interested in the incident.\\xa0Families on both sides are still sensitive about the disputed events. At the memorial service I attended in 2012, some surviving family members of those who died in this tragedy traveled to Hillsville from as far away as New England.\\xa0  \\xa0 My connection comes from my great-grandmother of Rockbridge County.\\xa0 She and her Bible study group traveled to Richmond to pray with inmates at Libby prison, including Sidna Allen. \\xa0 While in prison, Sidna focused on woodworking and building furniture in order to sell items to support his family. \\xa0 During my great-grandmother’s visit, she purchased a box made by Allen.\\xa0 Written inside is, ‘Made by J. Sidna Allen, $5.’  \\xa0 My grandmother handed the box down to me a few years before she died. \\xa0 Since elected to Congress, I have displayed the box in my DC office. \\xa0 The Carroll County Historical Society Museum features a collection of Sidna Allen’s work: tables, treasure and jewelry boxes. His woodworking style reflected folk marquetry, creating intricate designs in his wooden objects.  \\xa0 As we look back on this incident, it’s important to remember that we learn little about the past by attempting to apply modern law and mores.\\xa0 Romance, politics, power, and family honor all merged to become a lethal powder keg in this tragic event. \\xa0 The play was extremely well done. I was mesmerized by the performance. This same group has performed “Thunder in the Hills” every few years since 2012. \\xa0 They say this is it. But I for one hope they will do it again or that maybe the Barter Theatre will pick up the production in the future. \\xa0 Amongst the excellent cast was my former colleague in the Virginia House of Delegates, Tom Jackson. He played Floyd Allen and was superb. After the play, he showed me both Floyd Allen’s pocket watch which he carried throughout the performance, and the lawbooks in the old courthouse’s library which belonged to Commonwealth Attorney William Foster, who was killed in the shootout, and Dexter Goad, the Circuit Court Clerk, who was injured.  \\xa0 I should also mention that Martha Goad was played by Cynthia Jackson, Tom’s wife, who was at Emory & Henry College while I was there. There were many outstanding performances and I do not believe I have ever seen a better cast. \\xa0 As the play shows, the story has always been complicated. At Sidna Allen’s death, the Lynchburg Newspaper wrote, “The Allens have just about proved their theory of their defense.\\xa0 That they were not all fundamentally bad men, but men for whom fate, in a bad hour, set a vicious stage.”\\xa0 \\xa0 In a like manner, Carroll County is a good place that more than 100 years ago found itself thrust by fate, in a bad hour, into a vicious set of circumstances.\\xa0 Let us hope that this may never occur again. \\xa0 Sidna’s old house in Carroll County remains today. Located just outside Fancy Gap, the Queen Anne style house is an iconic Carroll landmark. In 1974, the house was designated for the National Register of Historic Places. \\xa0 A portion of the play’s ticket sales go to the J. Sidna Allen House Restoration project. Contributions can be sent to the charitable organization at: \\xa0 J. Sidna Allen Home  c/o Carroll County Historical Society and Museum  P.O. Box 937 Hillsville, VA 24343. \\xa0 You may also visit carrollvamuseum.org to make an online donation via PayPal. \\xa0 If you have questions, concerns, or comments, feel free to contact my office.\\xa0 You can call my Abingdon office at 276-525-1405 or my Christiansburg office at 540-381-5671.\\xa0 To reach my office via email, please visit my website at https://morgangriffith.house.gov.\\xa0 \\xa0 ### Enter your email address to get the latest updates straight to your inbox.

       " \"Tax Day, the height of the year for the IRS, and probably an item on your spring-cleaning list, came and went last Monday, April 15th. As we all scrambled to meet the April 15th deadline, it's evident that the aftermath of Tax Day brings a significant workload for hardworking IRS employees and honest taxpayers alike. No matter what side of it you’re on, you still had to file; no one was granted immunity to audits, even potential delays to receiving their returns. All of this to say, I stumbled upon an eye-opening statistic: this year, an estimated 19.4 million taxpayers were expected to request an extension to file their taxes, giving them until June 1st to file. This number is quite a jump from a decade ago when only 12.5 million taxpayers sought extensions. What's behind this rise? It's not merely procrastination due to busy schedules; you guessed it - it's a reflection of the challenges posed by record-high inflation and the soaring cost of living.  If compiling all the individual documents and forms to file wasn’t enough of a stressor, there was a noticeable uptick in reports about tax fraud attempts by resourceful scammers. These individuals were and still are continuously seeking new ways to exploit tax-paying citizens for financial gain, whether it’s through fake bills, falsified late fees or requesting additional funds through forms that don’t exist. Here are some important tips to protect yourself from tax scams: · The IRS will\\xa0NEVER\\xa0contact you through email, text, or social media. Be wary of suspicious messages requesting personal information. · Do not store your\\xa0Social Security Number on a computer or cell phone. Hackers can break in and steal your information without you knowing, so it’s best to delete it from old emails, notes, or documents. · File your tax returns\\xa0early\\xa0if you can! The less time criminals have to impersonate you and steal your refund the better. · If you’re filing online, be sure to use a secure network.\\xa0Do not\\xa0use public Wi-Fi somewhere like a coffee shop or library.  Last year alone, we assisted nearly 400 constituents with IRS-related issues, and our offices will be available to assist this year as well. If you filed your taxes before the April 15th deadline, but have not received your tax return yet, I encourage you to contact one of our district offices in Cottleville or Jefferson City. Although we cannot officially advocate on your behalf until after the IRS' June 1st deadline, we are available to discuss your situation and provide guidance before then. Please don't hesitate to reach out to us for assistance.  CONTACT US:\\xa0I encourage you to visit my official\\xa0website\\xa0or call my offices in Jefferson City (573-635-7232) or Cottleville (636-327-7055) with your questions and concerns.

I often say that forestry is a win-win-win: healthy forests give us pure water, clean air, diverse wildlife habitats, and forest products that we use every day.\\xa0I know firsthand the countless benefits trees provide to our daily lives, and I understand the importance of science-based policy to ensure our forests continue to thrive. This April, I hope you will join me in celebrating Arbor Day. May we recognize and honor the importance of trees and all the natural blessings they bring us. It also serves as an opportunity for us to acknowledge our role in ensuring forests remain healthy and thriving. Each of us has a role to play in being good stewards of our environment, ensuring our forests are healthier and stronger for generations to enjoy, whether that be through planting trees in your backyard or simply supporting active forest management. I’m working on comprehensive forestry legislation and held a legislative hearing last week on a discussion draft of commonsense policy to empower land managers to use the tools they need to quickly address the mismanagement of our forests before it becomes a catastrophe. I’m also proud to champion legislation like the EXPLORE Act, the Save Our Sequoias Act, the America’s Wildlife Habitat Conservation Act, and more that will make advancements to conserve our environment and ensure our public lands and forests are properly managed for Americans to enjoy for years to come.\\xa0 Today and every day, let us celebrate our amazing and magnificent forests that God has so graciously blessed us with in America!',\n",

       " '502 Cannon HOB, Washington, DC 20515Email Me(202) 225-6435 This week, as I visited a number of Third District communities, several major economic indicators were published, confirming what we already know: President Biden’s inflation hasn’t ended, and a radical change of direction in Washington’s fiscal policy is needed to remedy an ailing economy. This week, the U.S. Department of Commerce reported America’s gross domestic product for the first quarter of 2024 grew by a mere 1.6 percent and core inflation—which leaves out the more dynamic fluctuation of food and energy prices—rose by 3.7 percent. As both these numbers came out much less favorable than projections, it’s not surprising small business optimism has reached its lowest level since 2012, according to the National Federation of Independent Business. To make matters worse, the workforce participation rate remains well below its pre-pandemic level. As discouraged workers have yet to return from the sidelines of the economy, I continue to hear from Third District employers about the difficulty of filling positions for which they are hiring. Hope for the nation’s economic recovery rests on inflation cooling to 2 percent, which would provide the Federal Reserve with the chance to cut interest rates currently on a 23-year-high. Ominously, Fed Chair Jerome Powell recently said it is taking “longer than expected” to reach this target. However, the path to making life more affordable for American families and small businesses is not a mystery. Under President Joe Biden, Democrats have added trillions of dollars to our debt through their wasteful Green New Deal, Build Back Better, and “Inflation Act” agenda. To call these spending sprees “sugar highs” for our economy would be generous. They have been disastrous, adding more than $1000 per month to the average Nebraska household costs since January 2021 while earnings failed to keep up. In contrast to the irresponsible policies coming from the White House, we need a strategy to fight inflation and incentivize steady, robust economic growth. This can only come through a long-term vision which recognizes the diverse economic circumstances for households and businesses across our country, rejects overregulation, and restores of the dignity of work and opportunity to give Americans a path to prosperity. Contrary to the shortsighted Biden agenda, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) grew real wages for American workers, outperformed federal revenue projections, and benefited Americans across the income spectrum. We did this through our efforts to ensure the tax code rewarded farms, ranches, and small businesses who invested in productivity and adding jobs. We also did this by ensuring our tax cuts rewarded working families the most—doubling the guaranteed deduction to ensure the first $24,000 a married couple earns is tax free (now $29,200 thanks to inflation adjustments) and doubling the child tax credit to $2,000 per child to help working parents meet their everyday expenses. A bill we passed out of the Ways and Means Committee and the House at the start of this year, which is currently being held up in the Senate, would index the 2017 version of the child tax credit for inflation while allowing the parents of larger families who work to claim the credit for each child concurrently, rather than consecutively as they are currently required to. Because of the success of TCJA, Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee announced this week we have formed ten teams to hold listening sessions with American families and job creators and promote both proven and innovative tax policies. I will chair the committee’s Rural America Tax Team, which will meet with rural Americans and produce recommendations for the next generation of tax reform in 2025. I am very glad that Reps. Randy Feenstra, from across the river in Iowa’s 4th District, and Michelle Fischbach, who represents the largest agriculture district in Minnesota will be helping lead the effort as vice-chairs. Ensuring our tax code reflects the unique challenges facing the wide spectrum of Americans, including those of us in rural communities, can mean the difference between solvency or insolvency for family farms and small businesses. To secure prosperity for the future, we must preserve and build on the gains of TCJA. ###',\n",

On Monday, I celebrated Earth Day by taking a bike ride through Arlington Heights. In March, I secured $480,000 to allow the Village of Arlington Heights to build a safe and accessible walk and bike path connecting the Palatine Trail with the Prospect Heights Trail. This connectivity will allow people to easily access destinations without the use of cars, providing them with vital physical activity and reducing their carbon footprint. Earth Day is a time to celebrate the incredible planet we live on and fight for its future. It is also reminder that the climate crisis isn\\'t just a challenge — it\\'s an opportunity to make investments in a cleaner future. Efforts like these are essential to encouraging people to reduce their reliance on gas powered transit, and transition to more efficient, environmentally friendly alternatives. On Thursday, I held my annual LGBTQIA+ roundtable, which hosts activists from across the Chicagoland area. It is an important chance to discuss the current state of LGBTQIA+ affairs and share some of the work I am doing to expand opportunities and strengthen protections for the LGBTQIA+ community. The event was moderated by Center on Halsted\\'s CEO, Joli Robinson. On Thursday night, I viewed the many incredible Congressional Art Competition submissions from Illinois\\' 5th district. Polina Popandopulo, a student from Ridgewood High School, was declared the winner for their submission, \"Best Buddies Down on the Farm.\" This piece, along with the other winning submissions from congressional districts around the country, will hang in the U.S. Capitol for the next year.

Clarke (NY-09) released the following statement regarding reports that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has delayed plans to ban menthol cigarettes: “The tobacco industry has a long history of strategically marketing their products to Black and brown communities, particularly through the use of menthol cigarettes. It’s important for the federal government to recognize and address the harmful impact tobacco has on our communities. However, regardless of the administration’s decision to delay action, I am concerned about how the enforcement of the ban could exacerbate existing, harmful racial bias in our police system. America has a history of over-policing Black and brown communities, and the harms caused by this bias have had an incalculable impact. I believe we can both create more equitable public health policies and heal the health disparities that plague Black and brown Americans.

Chris Smith (R-NJ), Chair of the House Global Human Rights and International Organizations Subcommittee, called the recently released report on the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) “an absolute whitewash aimed at covering up the antisemitism, violence and hate that has poisoned the agency for decades.” \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Smith, the author of legislation to ban US funding for UNRWA, said “the grotesque flaws in the report further underscore how UNRWA apologists have operated with impunity over the years trying to deceive and vindicate the actions of this appalling agency. No one should be fooled.” \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0Officially called the report of the Independent Review Group, the document is widely referred to as the Colonna report after its chief author. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0“From the very beginning, the Colonna report never aimed to be anything but a total whitewash,” Smith continued. “Senior officials connected to the report repeatedly stated that their goal was to ‘reassure donors’ and ‘provide the donors with further cover.’” \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0“It’s no coincidence that the staff that conducted the review—from its leadership on down—was comprised entirely of individuals and organizations with long histories of dismissing concerns over UNRWA’s infiltration by Hamas and its blatant promotion and complicity in murderous antisemitism,” said Smith. “Naturally, they produced a ‘report’ that ignores grave abuses and proposes cosmetic reforms.” \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0“UNRWA remains an unreformable, terror-complicit agency that teaches Palestinian children to hate Jews and glorifies suicidal martyrdom and the evisceration of Israel as a state,” Smith said. “It is a child soldier factory—and no bogus report can change that fact.” \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0“It’s long past time for the US and the rest of the world to move beyond this Hamas-ridden UN agency and find an alternative that does not promote, espouse, or affiliate with entities or individuals that advance violence, terrorism and antisemitism,” said Smith. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0Smith, who has chaired three congressional hearings over the past ten months on UNRWA’s unbridled antisemitism, is the author of the Stop Support for UNRWA Act (HR 7122)—which would permanently prohibit US contributions to UNRWA.

       " 'Washington Times America continues to fund both sides of conflicts and wars. This is typified by the latest\\xa0Israel\\xa0aid portion of the package voted on by the\\xa0House of Representatives. Almost half of the\\xa0Israel\\xa0aid package goes to “humanitarian” purposes, with deference to how to distribute the $9 billion left in the hands of the Biden administration — yes, the same Biden administration that has taken the position of the “two-state solution.” That is to say, President Biden, who is kneeling to the base of the Democratic Party, which exclaims, “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,” has arranged for up to $9 billion to be sent to\\xa0Gaza. The same\\xa0Gaza\\xa0that has been controlled by\\xa0Hamas\\xa0for more than a decade. The same\\xa0Gaza\\xa0that is ostensibly governed by the Palestinian Authority, which has honored and given bounties to suicide bombers who have indiscriminately killed Israeli civilians. Up to $9 billion to the same\\xa0Gaza\\xa0that has acknowledged that\\xa0Hamas\\xa0has been hijacking most, if not all, of the humanitarian aid that\\xa0Israel\\xa0has facilitated. That\\xa0Hamas. The\\xa0Hamas\\xa0that steals food and medicine and converts it into use for the terrorists while starving the people in\\xa0Gaza. We, the\\xa0House of Representatives, voted to give upward of $9 billion to\\xa0Gaza/Hamas, which takes the pressure off of Iran, which has been financially supporting\\xa0Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and other terrorist organizations. The package passed in the Senate on Tuesday and will be signed by the president this week. Who will determine the distribution of the funds? None other than the hapless Biden regime. The same regime that insists that\\xa0Israel\\xa0recognize the right of statehood of an area that houses the soulless, ruthless terrorists of\\xa0Hamas. The\\xa0Hamas\\xa0terrorists who have sworn to annihilate\\xa0Israel. The Biden regime, now captured by antisemitic radicals who want the genocidal eradication of\\xa0Israel, insists that\\xa0Israel\\xa0engage in a one-sided cease-fire. It has demanded that\\xa0Israel\\xa0stop attacking\\xa0Hamas\\xa0animals and let\\xa0Hamas\\xa0regroup.\\xa0Israel\\xa0has offered a cease-fire seven times, but\\xa0Hamas\\xa0refuses because\\xa0Israel\\xa0demands that\\xa0Hamas\\xa0(which broke a cease-fire when it barbarically attacked\\xa0Israel\\xa0on Oct. 7) also lay down its weapons. Even the funding that goes to\\xa0Israel\\xa0in the aid package will be leveraged, directed and controlled to a large extent by the Biden regime. Thank goodness that the ongoing, annualized payment of more than $3 billion, which has been on autopilot since 2018, is in the process of delivery, as it has fewer Biden strings. Does\\xa0Israel\\xa0need help? Of course. That is why the best thing that House Speaker Mike Johnson has done was to push a package that provided military and humanitarian aid to\\xa0Israel\\xa0last November. Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer and Mr. Biden opposed that package because it was paid for instead of being tacked onto our national debt. The need to help\\xa0Israel\\xa0is also why additional legislation was proposed, including my bill\\xa0HR\\xa07271. The speaker failed to move on that bill because, he said, “The Senate won’t pass it.” So, the Schumer-Biden cabal, which refused to pass and sign into law an aid package that passed out of the House on a bipartisan vote last November, insisted that its proposal, which appeases the Democrats’ antisemitic base, be brought forward instead. The Schumer-Biden cabal also demanded that the entire Senate package of aid to Ukraine ($61 billion),\\xa0Israel\\xa0($23 billion) and Taiwan ($2.5 billion) be passed. And so, it was. And that’s how we end up funding both sides of the\\xa0Israel-Hamas\\xa0war. Democrats refuse to supply aid to\\xa0Israel\\xa0unless four things happen: (1) There cannot be a pay-for; the cost of the aid must be added to our national debt; (2) No funding for\\xa0Israel\\xa0unless Ukraine also gets funded; (3) To appease the antisemitic Democratic base, there has to be money going to\\xa0Gaza-Hamas\\xa0and (4) There cannot be U.S. border security policy tied to the Ukraine funding, contrary to what Mr. Johnson promised privately and publicly, dozens of times. Last word. For at least three reasons, we know that assistance for Ukraine, not\\xa0Israel, was the main objective for Democrats, who continue to kneel to their antisemitic base: (1) It was the Ukrainian flag that Democrats were waving on the floor after the vote last Saturday, not the Israeli flag; (2) Democrat Gerry Connolly brazenly claimed “the Ukrainian-Russian border is our border” without mention of the need to protect our true own border or\\xa0Israel’s border and (3) while almost half of the\\xa0Israel\\xa0funding will likely be used to refurbish and rearm\\xa0Hamas, there is no demand that nearly half of the Ukraine aid goes to the enemy who brutally attacked and continues to fight Ukraine. If the first\\xa0Israel\\xa0aid package of last November was the best thing Mr. Johnson has done, this last legislation (which came to the House as one bill and returned to the Senate as one bill, not four separate bills) is one of the worst.

       " 'April 25, 2024 BOSTON\\xa0– Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) issued the following statement on peaceful student protests. “Peaceful protest is a central tenet of our democracy and students standing for justice have often been a catalyst for much-needed change. From the 1960s civil rights movement, the Vietnam War protests, the struggle for gender equality, and the movement for Black lives, to the global movement for peace in Israel and Palestine, many of the rights we tout today were earned thanks to the sweat equity of students demonstrating on college campuses across the nation. “Every student, regardless of background or faith, has a right to feel safe and show up in the world without fear or discrimination — and we must ensure that those exercising their right to free speech are met with dignity and respect, not criminalization. “That is why I am deeply concerned about misinformation that aims to undermine this movement, outside agitators that detract from peaceful solidarity actions, and the aggressive response by law enforcement to students peacefully protesting across the country. The National Guard or riot police should not be called in response to students’ peaceful freedom of expression. Let me be clear: we absolutely should not repeat the mistakes of generations past, and history has its eyes on us.\\xa0 “I call on university administrators to ensure that there are no academic repercussions for peaceful student protestors, and I urge law enforcement — at all levels of government — to exercise restraint. Safety for all students must be the priority. “I am grateful to students nationwide and across\\xa0the Massachusetts 7th — at Emerson, Northeastern, MIT, Tufts, Boston University, Harvard, and more — who are raising their voices and putting their bodies on the line to press for action to save lives in Gaza. That is what this movement is about. We cannot lose sight of the horrific injustices that Palestinians in Gaza are facing and I am proud to stand in solidarity with peaceful protestors.\\xa0 “My office is monitoring the situation at campuses in our district and I will continue pushing federally for a lasting bilateral ceasefire in Gaza to save lives, return the hostages, and deliver much-needed humanitarian aid to the region. From Massachusetts to the Middle East, our destinies are tied.” Since the horrific October 7th attack, Congresswoman Pressley has consistently and stridently called for a ceasefire to save lives, return all hostages, and surge humanitarian aid to Gaza. Last week, Rep. Pressley\\xa0delivered a floor speech\\xa0in which she called for urgent de-escalation in the Middle East and renewed her calls for a ceasefire in Gaza to prevent a broader regional war. Throughout the Israel and Hamas conflict, Rep. Pressley has been a vocal and consistent advocate of diplomacy, de-escalation, and saving lives. ### Washington DC Office 402 Cannon HOB\\r\\nWashington, DC 20515 Phone (202) 225-5111\\r\\nFax (202) 225-9322 District Office 1295 River Street\\r\\nHyde Park, MA 02136 Phone (617) 850-0040\\r\\nFax (202) 225-9322',\n",
       " \"Asbury Park Press app. logo Jerry Carino\\xa0- Asbury Park Press Staff Writer\\xa0 In early 2022, longtime Wall High School art teacher Jill Alexander shipped four of her oil paintings to an exhibit in Denver with a bit of trepidation. She’d created the works — scenes from Cuba inspired by travel there — in the presence of her ailing mother; they lived together in Wall and Jill was her caregiver. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n “It was uplifting for her when there wasn’t a whole lot to be uplifted about,” Jill Alexander said.\\n Carol Alexander died of bone-marrow cancer in 2020. Now Jill was loaning the paintings to an art show run by an old classmate, who had put out a call for contributors, and she “had a funny feeling” about parting\\r\\nwith them. “My husband, when I was packing them up, said, ‘Are you sure you really want to do this?’” Jill recalled. \\r\\nShe never saw them again.\\n Eight works from the exhibit, including her paintings, were stolen from the gallery — a pop-up exhibit in the foyer of a Denver office building. Security footage showed\\xa0a man dressed in black stuffing them into a duffel bag. Two years later, despite a promising lead, the case remains unsolved. It faded into a bureaucratic haze before a passing conversation got the attention of U.S. Rep. Chris Smith, whose interest has revived the investigation.\\n\\n The case goes cold The Denver exhibit, dubbed “The Waiting Room Gallery,” was the brainchild of Dan Drossman — a classmate of Alexander’s from their days in the New York School of Visual Arts’ masters program. Alexander, a Wall native who at the time was working on an illustrated children’s book that has since been published, never made it out there. Instead, she heard second-hand from a friend in Denver that the exhibit had been burglarized. “I thought, ‘There’s no way Dan Drossman would not have called me,’” she said. But he didn’t. Alexander had to call him for confirmation. Eventually, she learned that the gallery was not insured. Three of her paintings were listed at a sale price of $4,000, and the fourth was listed at $6,000.\\xa0Drossman did set up a GoFundMe campaign\\xa0that netted $3,000 for Alexander, although that wasn’t her primary concern. “I just want these paintings back,” she said.\\n Denver police assigned a detective to the case, and Alexander said Drossman told her that a QR code in the exhibit had been scanned by the thief’s phone — so authorities had an IP address. Then, nothing. “The detective in charge never returned any of my messages,” Alexander said. She later learned the detective retired.\\n \\r\\nFinally, a breakthrough Each year, Smith’s office runs a\\xa0Congressional Art Competition\\xa0for students throughout his district (this year’s concludes May 3 with a reception and awards ceremony at Community Medical Center in Toms River). Alexander’s students have been regular contributors. Last year Smith’s district director, Jeff Sagnip, asked art teachers to submit a work for display. Alexander told him she would make some prints. “Why prints?” Sagnip asked. “That’s when I told him the story,” Alexander said. “I don’t feel comfortable; I haven’t put any work in any galleries since this happened.” \\r\\nWord reached Smith, he made some calls, and before long Alexander’s phone started ringing “The FBI reached out to me,” she said. “And Denver police put a new detective on it, and he contacted me.”\\n Just last week, the FBI added the four missing paintings to its online\\xa0National Stolen Art File. And Denver police posted a $2,000 reward for anyone with information that leads to the recovery of any of the works that disappeared from the exhibit. Alexander said investigators “are trying to obtain a warrant information for the two different IP addresses that pinged after the theft, so they can get to the bottom of who they belong to.” Most of all, she has the peace of mind of finally being heard. “For months I was so distraught after this happened. I was calling and emailing and nobody ever got back to me,” she said. “Now this after one simple conversation, so I am beyond grateful.” If nothing else, there are valuable real-world lessons for Alexander to impart on her students. “I tell them, ‘First, if you are looking to show your artwork somewhere, you have to make sure there is insurance at the space,” she said. “And No. 2, you should probably visit it. I don’t know I would send work somewhere (unseen) again. See the space and get a feel for it. “If it doesn’t feel right, maybe it isn’t right.”\\n \\r\\nJill Alexander’s missing paintings Here are the listings of the four paintings in the FBI’s National Stolen Art File: \\xa0 Portrait of a man in a straw hat\\xa0(https://artcrimes.fbi.gov/nsaf/el-granjero-de-tabaco) Street scene with three musicians\\xa0(https://artcrimes.fbi.gov/nsaf/los-tres-musicos) Street scene of men playing dominoes\\xa0(https://artcrimes.fbi.gov/nsaf/domino-al-atardecer) Havana street scene of a red car\\xa0(https://artcrimes.fbi.gov/nsaf/havana-street) Anyone with information on the paintings should call the Denver Police Department's Crime Stoppers tip line at 720-913-7867. \\n\\r\\nJerry Carino is community columnist for the Asbury Park Press, focusing on the Jersey Shore’s interesting people, inspiring stories and pressing issues.

       " 'WASHINGTON – U.S. Representative Pramila Jayapal (WA-07) is today announcing that she helped to secure $16 million for the Northwest Seaport Alliance (NWSA) from the Federal Highway Administration to deploy 36-58 zero-emission drayage trucks through vehicle purchases and development of charging/fueling infrastructure in the Seattle-Tacoma region.\\xa0 “Washington’s ports are vital to our economy, our supply chains, and our way of life here in Seattle.\\xa0 Ensuring these charging hubs are fully funded and given the resources needed to build and maintain clean energy infrastructure will protect our environment, our communities, and our economy,”\\xa0said Jayapal.\\xa0“This project will ensure that our cargo hauling services are modernized and will also drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions which disproportionately damage the air quality of communities near our seaports and along major freight corridors.” “The Northwest Seaport Alliance is deeply grateful to Congresswoman Jayapal for her leadership in helping secure $16 million in funding from the Federal Highway Administration’s Reduction of Truck Emissions at Port Facilities Grant Program,”\\xa0said Kristin Ang, Port of Tacoma Commission President and The Northwest Seaport Alliance Co-Chair.\\xa0“These funds will be instrumental in advancing our Zero-Emission Drayage Truck Incentive Program and accelerating the transition to zero-emission drayage trucks in the Puget Sound.” “The Managing Members of The Northwest Seaport Alliance have introduced bold policies aimed at eliminating seaport-related Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2040, and Scope 3 emissions by 2050 or sooner,”\\xa0said Hamdi Mohamed, Port of Seattle Commission President and The Northwest Seaport Alliance Co-Chair.\\xa0“Securing grant funding from programs like the Reduction of Truck Emissions at Port Facilities is critical to the successful transition to zero emissions operations for truck drivers. These funds will also support the network of charging infrastructure needed by truck drivers across the region.” This grant is a further step toward the transition to clean energy at the Port of Seattle. The effort to create the charging infrastructure for a zero-emission drayage fleet will help to reduce diesel particulate emissions in near-port communities experiencing significant health disparities and support the vitality of regional manufacturing and industrial centers and many small and medium-sized businesses. This project will benefit near-port communities such as the Duwamish Valley, South Park, and Georgetown and port workers by reducing the health impacts associated with diesel exhaust. Children who live in the Duwamish Valley have among the highest rates of hospitalization due to asthma compared with any other neighborhood in Seattle and life expectancy in Georgetown and South Park is eight years shorter than the city’s average. This funding is in addition to the $850,000 Jayapal\\xa0secured\\xa0for the program in the 2024 federal budget.

Kathy Castor (FL-14) led the entire Florida Democratic congressional delegation in urging the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to step in to stop Governor Ron DeSantis and the State of Florida\\xa0from ripping health coverage away from tens of thousands of children who currently rely on the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), known as Florida KidCare.\\xa0 A newly-enacted federal reform requires all state’s to maintain continuous coverage for children under age 19 for one\\xa0year after they have qualified for Medicaid and CHIP. Since the new law went into effect on January 1, 2024, Gov. DeSantis and the State of Florida have\\xa0wrongfully cut off 22,500 children from the care they need – the only state in the country to do so. Florida also is suing the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to upend the new coverage law for the right to continue to disenroll children from Florida KidCare.\\xa0 “While the Florida Legislature voted to expand Florida KidCare eligibility to children with family incomes up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL), we urge you not to approve the State’s requested punitive premium structure,”\\xa0the lawmakers write. “Florida’s costly barrier to coverage runs counter to Congressional intent. Congress clearly intended that 12-month continuous eligibility be effectuated without any barriers or roadblocks so that children would receive care and coverage under CHIP.” “As members of Florida’s congressional delegation, we are hopeful that the State will follow through with the proposed expansion of KidCare – and do so in a way that follows the law – allowing up to 165,000 more of our youngest neighbors to have access to high-quality coverage,”\\xa0the lawmakers concluded. “Florida children should not experience harmful and unlawful gaps in their coverage, be exposed to unaffordable premiums and be treated more harshly than children from other states.” The full letter is available\\xa0here\\xa0and below: \\xa0 April 25,\\xa02024 The Honorable Chiquita Brooks-LaSure\\xa0Administrator Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 200 Independence Avenue SW Washington, DC 20201\\n The Honorable Daniel\\xa0Tsai The Deputy Administrator and Director Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services 200 Independence Avenue SW Washington, DC 20201 \\xa0 RE: Florida’s Section 1115 Research and Demonstration Waiver Request for Florida KidCare Eligibility Extension Dear Administrator Brooks-LaSure and Deputy Administrator\\xa0Tsai: As members of the Florida congressional delegation, we write with deep concern about the premium penalties in the state’s proposed five-year Section 1115 waiver for Florida’s Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), known asFlorida KidCare. While the Florida Legislature voted to expand Florida KidCare eligibility to children with family incomes up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL), we urge you not to approve the State’s requested punitive premium structure. Florida’s costly barrier to coverage runs counter to Congressional intent. Congress clearly intended that 12-month continuous eligibility be effectuated without any barriers or roadblocks so that children would receive care and coverage under CHIP.\\n In the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 (CAA), Congress enacted legislation that definitely requires state Medicaid and CHIP programs to provide 12 months of continuous eligibility for children under the age of 19.1\\xa0This protection went into effect on January 1, 2024 with explicit directives for states to keep children continuously enrolledin Medicaid and CHIP for one year with two exceptions: the child reaches age 19 or the child ceases to be a resident of that particular state. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) later released guidance to states outlining three more exceptions to 12 months of continuous eligibility that are critical to protecting program integrity: the child or guardian requests a voluntary termination, the State determines eligibility was erroneously granted, or the child is deceased.\\xa0CMS subsequently issued a Frequently Asked Questions document clarifying that there is no exception to continuous eligibility for non-payment of premiums in Medicaid or CHIP—the only exceptions are the five outlined above.\\xa0The FAQ document confirms that states like Florida will continue to have\\xa0the\\xa0option to institute an enrollment fee in CHIP and require payment of the first month’s premium prior to enrollment. While we are pleased that the State of Florida enacted legislation to expand KidCare coverage to more childrenup to 300% of the federal poverty threshold, the State is creating barriers to care that appear unlawful. The waiver estimates that the State expects to enroll over 14,500 currently uninsured children between 200 and 300% of the FPL in the expanded KidCare in the first year, and nearly 165,000 additional children by the end of the five-year demonstrationperiod. Yet the waiver request also proposes new monthly premiums in six income-based tiers, ranging from $17 to $195 per month per family, with automatic increases of three percent each year. Unfortunately, the waiver submission strongly suggests that Florida intends to continue its practice of wrongfully disenrolling children for failure to pay the monthly premiums, which runs counter to the new continuous eligibility protection. Additionally, we believe the suggested premium structure in Florida’s Section 1115 waiver request is likely to bea significant financial barrier for children in lower income working families. Florida is one of a handful of states thatcharges premiums to children at income levels below 150 percent of the FPL, and State data has shown that thousands of children lost coverage monthly or were determined ineligible for initial enrollment due to non-payment of premiums in KidCare in the past.5\\xa0The proposed six-tier system will add to the administrative burden faced by state employees and to confusion by families, and the proposed annual three percent increase is likely to exacerbate these issues. Concurrently, the State has filed a lawsuit in federal court against CMS, claiming that states should be allowed to terminate children from their CHIP coverage for nonpayment of premiums despite the CAA’s new protection.6\\xa0We haverecently learned that the state has disenrolled 22,576 current KidCare enrollees since January 1, 2024, in contravention to federal law.7\\xa0Florida is the only state in the country that we are aware of that is brazenly disregarding the new federal protection for children. This is not happening in a vacuum. Since the Medicaid unwinding began last spring, the number of childrenenrolled in Medicaid has declined by over 460,000, a 17.1% decline in covered children.8\\xa0It is unclear what has happened to the coverage of the vast majority of these children, but the net enrollment in Florida KidCare has onlybeen 49,000, a large discrepancy which\\xa0bears\\xa0 review.9\\xa0We also know that Florida has a high number of procedural disenrollments: of the 1.35 million total Floridians who have lost their coverage during the unwinding, 70% were for procedural reasons, not because the individual wasno longer eligible for the program.10\\xa0Research from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) indicatesthat ¾ of children expected to lose Medicaid during the unwinding are very likely to remain eligible for Medicaid – afinding which suggests that children who lose Medicaid for procedural reasons are much more likely than adults to become uninsured.11\\xa0While the State has not disaggregated the data by age, there are numerous stories of children losing coverage inappropriately, which results in children missing needing care and families risking medical debt.12\\xa013This led to Secretary Becerra sending Governor DeSantis a letter because Florida was among the nine states with the largest number or highest percentage of disenrolled children during the unwinding. The letter from HHS stronglyencouraged the state to adopt strategies and waivers to help children to maintain needed access to care, none of which Florida has adopted. Children have unique health care needs, and access to consistent health coverage is critical for their development and well-being, allowing them to grow into healthy adults. Positive effects of health coverage for children include timely access to care and reductions in mortality, emergency care usage, and avoidable hospitalizations, as well as lesschronic disease in adulthood, higher rates of graduation, increased college enrollment, and higher future wages. Medicaid is a particularly strong program for children, with no waiting or special enrollment periods, entitlement toservices, and coverage of all medically necessary services.\\xa014\\xa0Research has shown that children who are disenrolled for all or part of a year are more likely to have fair or poor health care status compared to children with continuous coverage.15 Not only does continuous eligibility for children improve their short- and long-term health outcomes, it reduces financial barriers to care, promotes health equity, and is cost-effective for families and states. Reduced churn greatlylowers the administrative burden on states, who are\\xa0no\\xa0 longer tasked with conducting repeated eligibility reviews and re-enrollments.16\\xa0Continuous eligibility also lowers state health care costs by preventing health issues from going undetected and becoming more expensive in the long term. TheCongressional Budget Office (CBO) recently analyzed the effects of Medicaid during childhood on the economy and the budget. The experts found that an additional year of health coverage in childhood under a continuous eligibilitypolicy would improve labor outcomes in adulthood, including higher earnings, hours worked, and productivity, whichwould increase the returns on investment, boost the GDP, and produce positive long-term fiscal effects.17 Finally, we note that the State’s waiver request includes multiple public comments from the state comment period from individuals who were concerned about imposing premiums, the\\xa0amounts\\xa0of\\xa0the\\xa0premiums,\\xa0the\\xa0tier\\xa0structureof\\xa0the\\xa0premiums,\\xa0and\\xa0the\\xa0applicability\\xa0of\\xa0the\\xa0continuous\\xa0eligibility protection. It is not clear that the State took any action or responded to the public’s concerns: the only acknowledgement of these issues was the letter “N.” As members of Florida’s congressional delegation, we are hopeful that the State will follow through with the proposed expansion of KidCare – and do so in a way that follows the law – allowing up to 165,000 more of our youngest neighbors to have access to high-quality coverage. Florida children should not experience harmful and unlawful gaps in their coverage, be exposed to unaffordable premiums and be treated more harshly than children from other states.',\n",

       " \"Dear Friend, I hope you have had a good week. I wanted to take a moment to share a quick overview of some of the work I did this week while in Washington. On Thursday, I sat down with the Governor of Maryland, Wes Moore, to discuss the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore. On March 26, the bridge was hit by a cargo ship, resulting in the death of six bridge workers and a pause in all commercial movement into the port. The Key Bridge, for many, is a lifeline. It connects the people of Baltimore to jobs, ensures U.S. automobile makers expand the footprint of American made vehicles, and is a hub for agricultural exchange. Roughly 30,000 vehicles travel across the Baltimore Key Bridge on any given day, including commuters, long-distance travelers and those carrying goods to-and-from the Port of Baltimore. It is clear that rebuilding this bridge is critical to not just the people of Maryland, but for our economy as a whole. In my role as the lead Democrat on the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Subcommittee, I assured Governor Moore that a timely and efficient rebuild is top of mind. We further discussed how the state and the federal government can work in unison and what next steps are necessary to get this done. On Wednesday, I had the honor of welcoming Chicagoland veterans to Washington, D.C. in partnership with Honor Flight Chicago. Honor Flight is an organization that sponsors a trip to D.C. for World War II, Vietnam and Korean War veterans so that they can visit their respective memorials. Each time I meet with these brave veterans, I am inspired by the stories of their service and sacrifice. It is because of those sacrifices that we can enjoy our freedoms. I was honored to meet with them this past week and offer my sincerest appreciation for their courage and devotion to our country.  Last week, I embarked on a trip to Poland and Ukraine to meet with high-level officials and learn more about how Ukrainian forces are faring against Putin's army. This trip included members of Congress from both sides of the aisle and reaffirmed my belief that supporting Ukraine is not a partisan issue—it is an American one. Therefore on Wednesday, I joined my Republican colleague on BBC News to discuss what we learned from our meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and what must be done in Congress to ensure a Ukrainian victory.

       " \"Brooklyn, NY – Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries issued the following statement upon the news of the death of Congressman Donald M. Payne, Jr.:Today is a difficult day as we mourn the loss of a beloved public servant, colleague and dear friend. Over his six terms in Congress, Representative Donald M. Payne, Jr. was a tremendous advocate for the people of New Jersey’s Tenth Congressional District, following in the footsteps of his father, the first African American Member of Congress from the state.Rep. Donald Payne, Jr.’s long and valiant career in public service began when he founded the Newark South Ward Junior Democrats and continued at the Municipal Council of Newark and Essex County Board of Freeholders, always fighting for those he was privileged to represent. Don led this fight with vigorous passion and personal conviction, his own courageous battle with Type 1 Diabetes informing much of his life’s work to make our communities safer and healthier. Don Payne Jr. was a strong supporter of the Affordable Care Act and an outspoken advocate for men’s health, leading efforts to provide accessible screening and treatment options for cancer patients.As Chairman of the Railroad Subcommittee for the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Congressman Payne was instrumental in fighting for critical upgrades to New Jersey’s transit system and in crafting the historic Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that has strengthened our nation. A Member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, Don passed legislation to protect America’s children and to make DHS communication more effective during emergencies.Don leaves behind a legacy of relentless determination in the face of adversity. Our nation is forever indebted to Rep. Payne, Jr. for his service and commitment to his community, to the Congress and to the country. I am grateful to my classmate and friend for the role he played in my own public service journey, through our conversations on train rides to and from Washington and our close partnership as Members from neighboring delegations.\\xa0I join the entire House Democratic Caucus in expressing our sincere condolences to Don’s wife Beatrice, his children Donald III, Jack and Yvonne and the entire Payne family.  ### Subscribe to our e-newsletter that provides updates\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ton important issues, my work in the Congress and what's\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thappening in our district.\",\n",

They’re expected to run for their lives and stay home from class.” \\xa0 WASHINGTON\\xa0—\\xa0Today, Speaker Johnson joined the Hugh Hewitt Show ahead of his meeting with Jewish students at Columbia University to discuss the troubling rise of virulent antisemitism on American college campuses. \\xa0 Click here to listen to the full interview \\xa0 On the Speaker’s visit to Columbia:  \\xa0 What we’re seeing on these college campuses across the country is disgusting and unacceptable. And we have to – every leader in this country, every political official, every citizen of good conscience – has to speak out and say that this is not who we are in America, and we got to have accountability and that’s what my colleagues and I are going to be working on.\\xa0 \\xa0 On the national rise of antisemitism: \\xa0 We have Jewish students who have actually been physically assaulted, they’ve been harassed and been intimidated and threatened. What we need to be doing is, \\xa0I love the clip from Tom Cotton. My friend Tom said before your break, we need to revoke federal funding to these universities that they cannot keep control. We need to revoke these student visas for these violent protesters. You don’t have a right to be here and to do this, but Jewish students have a right to be able to peacefully attend classes. \\xa0 They’re trying to get an education, and this is just madness. And you know, I’ve seen some of these man on the street interviews with some of these kids who are protesting. You and I both know the vast majority of them have no idea what they’re talking about. They don’t know the facts. Some of them are denying that October 7 even happened. I mean, it’s just ridiculous. And we’re calling upon and demanding these university officials to get control. This situation is just completely out of control right now. \\xa0 On Democrats failure to counter antisemitism in their party: \\xa0 I’ll tell you that the real problem we have right now is that we’re not getting strong leadership, obviously from the White House or even some Democrats in Congress. I mean, the White House is caving to the antisemitic, I call it the pro-Hamas wing of the party. Now they backpedaled on their support for Israel. I mean, if you get members of Congress refusing to denounce even the chants of death to America, they just go silent. They won’t call that out and some members, Democratic members of Congress, are even calling these antisemitic mobs peaceful protesters and defending the harassment, intimidation and all the rest. So it’s really become a serious problem. And they’re allowing mob rule to overtake the American ideals of free speech and the free exchange of ideas and in the free exercise of religion. This is not who we are. \\xa0 On the national security supplemental: \\xa0 I know that history is going to judge this well. It was the right thing to do. This is a this is a very dangerous time. We truly do have a new Axis of Evil. You have China, Russia, and Iran, and often North Korea working together in coordination. They’re funding one another’s aggression. And the reason you and I both know, and you highlight this all the time, the reason this is happening is because the current president is projecting weakness on the world stage and our adversaries are acting aggressively and provocatively, and taking advantage of that. \\xa0 So, we had this moment in time, Hugh, this historic question: would America stand by our allies stand by Israel, the beleaguered people of Ukraine in this pivotal moment? Or would we shrink back and, in my view, abdicate our obvious responsibility and role in the world? I don’t believe we need to be the world’s policeman. I don’t believe that is our burden. But I do believe that the perception of a strong America is essential on the world stage. And I think the Congress has acted to make sure that happens. \\xa0 ### \\n\\nTags: \\n Tweet\\n Share\\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tH-232, The Capitol\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWashington, D.C. 20515\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t202-225-4000\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t ©2024 U.S. House of Representatives.

Arizola had been a border patrol agent in Laredo before being deployed to Iraq in May 2004. His family delayed their son’s birthday party so Sgt. Arizola could attend when he returned, but on June 8, 2005, a day before he was scheduled to return from Iraq, Sgt. Arizola was killed in an explosion near his vehicle in Baghdad, Iraq. He was 31 years old. Dr. Cuellar introduced H.R. 2754 earlier this year to designate the United States Postal Service facility at 2395 East Del Mar Boulevard in Laredo, Texas, as the Lance Corporal David Lee Espinoza, Lance Corporal Juan Rodrigo Rodriguez & Sergeant Roberto Arizola Jr. Post Office Building.

       " ' Last week, the Palisades Nuclear Power Plant in Covert received a $1.52 billion conditional loan commitment from the Department of Energy to restart operations in 2025. This is great news! I’ve led the bipartisan charge in Congress behind this historic project because it will bring economic opportunity, lower energy costs, and greater energy security for Southwest Michigan.  Repowering Palisades means bringing 800 megawatts of safe, reliable, carbon-free energy generation for more than 800,000 homes - and hundreds of highly skilled, good-paying jobs right here to Michigan’s Fourth Congressional District.  According to Market Van Buren’s Zach Morris, “we’re getting back $259 million of economic impact in our local economy, regionally.” That’s one of the many reasons I, the federal government, the State of Michigan, local officials, chambers of commerce, labor unions, environmental groups, and many others came together in support of this project.  For our nation, this federal investment marks an important milestone. Palisades could be the first-ever recommissioning of a nuclear power plant – a key step in regaining American energy security and independence. The plant’s owner, Holtec International, is also planning to build two industry-first small modular reactor (SMR) units at the site which have the innovative potential to generate even more reliable carbon-free energy.  Leading up to the announcement, I’ve been advocating to position Southwest Michigan at the forefront of our nation’s lower-cost, safe, and reliable energy future. I’m proud to have led the bipartisan congressional letter for a safe and swift review of the loan application that was approved last week.  I’ve been highly engaged at the federal level on this critical issue by pressing the Biden Administration on restarting Palisades, supporting the power purchase agreement with Wolverine Power Cooperative, and visiting Holtec’s innovative manufacturing and research facility to see work being done for Palisades first-hand.   These steps are in addition to discussing how repowering the plant furthers my mission of making our area an even better place to live, work, and raise a family.

       " ' April 15th is one of the most loathsome days for Americans: Tax Day. Last Congress, the Democrat Majority and President Biden increased funding for the IRS by roughly $72 billion. This included funding to hire over 87,000 IRS agents with a focus on so-called rich Americans. However, when you look past the window dressing, it’s clear the IRS is still targeting middle-class Americans at an alarming pace.  As of last summer, 63% of new audits have targeted individuals making under $200,000, according to a recent report from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. This report also highlights that despite billions in funding, and a hiring goal of 3,700 to go after the so-called wealthy, the IRS has only hired a whopping 34 people during the first six months.  Already, the IRS hasn’t even been able to execute its top-line objectives, which is consistent with analysis from the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation showing that most of the tax revenue raised from these new agents would come from lower- and middle-income earners. This is why I voted to cut funding for the 87,000 IRS agents and claw back the ridiculously bloated IRS budget. You should be able to keep more of your hard-earned money, not send it to Washington so the IRS can then target you.   Remember, last year, the federal government collected $4.4 trillion in revenue. Washington doesn’t have a revenue problem; it has a spending problem. I do not want the Biden Administration’s IRS targeting middle-class families and small businesses across Van Buren and Berrien counties. I am committed to protecting Americans from governmental overreach and I will continue to battle bureaucrats in Washington over the proper size, role, and scope of the federal government.

       " ' Over the weekend, Iran launched a direct assault against Israel. I continue to stand with Israel, and completely condemn the actions of Iran.  Iran remains one of the most heavily sanctioned countries in the world. However, as recent as March 2024, the Biden Administration granted sanction waivers to Iran, potentially giving the regime access to billions of dollars. We cannot provide a financial lifeline to the Iranian regime as it continues to support terrorist organizations around the world and now directly attacks our allies.  My bill, the No U.S. Financing for Iran Act, was one of the first considered in the House to hold Iran accountable as well as limit the Iranian regime’s ability to finance terrorism. I am proud to say that H.R. 5921 passed the House with a bipartisan vote of 294-105.  The No U.S. Financing for Iran Act protects our national security interests in three main ways.  First, it prohibits Treasury from issuing licenses that allow U.S. financial institutions to enable trade with Iran.  Second, it further cuts off financing for Iran from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). While Iran is not currently seeking assistance from the Fund, it certainly could as an IMF member country. My bill makes clear that the United States, as the IMF’s largest shareholder, will oppose any such request. This prohibition would extend to the IMF Special Drawing Rights program, which Iran utilized in 2021 to access approximately $5 billion.  Lastly, it extends an existing prohibition against Export-Import Bank financing for Iran.  My bill is targeted. It tightens our grip on the Ayatollahs while permitting licenses to allow for humanitarian aid to continue flowing to the Iranian people.  When Americans deposit their earnings in a U.S. bank or entrust the government with their tax dollars, they do so assuming that the money will not be used in ways that undermine the security of our nation. These are commonsense but long overdue prohibitions to hold the Iranian regime accountable.

       " \"Eminent policymakers and scholars address today’s law and policy challenges By Cristian Rivera January 29, 2024 By 2050, Latinas are expected to make up 13% of the U.S. population, account for 11% of the labor force, and have a median age 11 years younger than their white counterparts. Yet Latinas comprise only\\xa02.5% of all U.S. lawyers,\\xa0account for less than 1% of all partners in law firms and have never served on the highest court in 44 states. To address this alarming gap in Latina representation and leadership in law and policy, the\\xa0UCLA Latino Policy and Politics Institute,\\xa0the\\xa0Latina Futures, 2050 Lab,\\xa0the\\xa0Latina Lawyers Bar Association,\\xa0and the\\xa0UCLA Chicanx Latinx Law Review\\xa0hosted the inaugural\\xa0Latina Futures: Transforming the Nation Through Law and Policy\\xa0symposium.\\xa0 The sold-out event, which took place Jan. 20 and 21 at UCLA’s Luskin Conference Center, brought together nearly 400 prominent Latina scholars, attorneys, politicians, policy leaders and students from across the country to explore today’s legal and advocacy challenges and opportunities through a Latina lens. “This weekend, we are replacing the status quo with forward-thinking, accurate, and necessary contributions from Latina leaders now and well into the future,” said\\xa0Sonja Diaz,\\xa0founding executive director of the Latino Policy and Politics Institute and co-founder of Latina Futures, 2050 Lab, in her opening remarks.\\xa0\\xa0 The event featured 11 panels and plenary sessions, two fireside chats, a keynote and networking opportunities that touched on a variety of topics, including affirmative action and reproductive justice, the intersectionality of Latina and LGBTQ+ identities, and avenues toward advancing legal and policy reforms that promote equality and inclusion. Participants shared personal and professional experiences that highlighted the need to increase the representation of Latina leaders in decision-making positions. Among the symposium’s 70 speakers was California Chief Justice Patricia Guerrero, the first Latina in this role, who spoke about her journey from the Imperial Valley and the challenges she overcame.\\xa0 In a fireside chat moderated by Margaret Salazar-Porzio, Mary Murguía, chief judge of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and her sister Janet Murguía, CEO and president of the civil rights and advocacy nonprofit UnidosUS, delved into their paths towards leadership and the hope they have for future leaders to unite Latino communities and the nation in an increasingly divided world. U.S. Rep. Nanette Barragán, a UCLA alumna from the class of 2000, California state Sen. María Elena Durazo, New Mexico state Sen. Antoinette Sedillo-Lopez, and Texas state Rep. Maria Luisa Flores shared their perspectives with Laura Gómez, a professor at UCLA School of Law, on the need for a Latina lens in policymaking across all levels of government. In addition, Vilma Martinez, U.S. ambassador to Argentina and former president and general counsel of MALDEF, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, challenged attendees to take ownership of the future and contribute to a more inclusive and equitable society.\\xa0 Reflecting on the\\xa050-year anniversary of\\xa0MALDEF, Martinez told the audience during the program that she felt an initial sense of disappointment because she thought the organization’s work would have been completed by this time. However, she continued, her feelings shifted with her recognition that our nation is built on grand aspirations and ideals — and achieving them is a long and continuous process. Professor\\xa0Veronica Terriquez,\\xa0director of\\xa0UCLA’s Chicano Studies Research Center\\xa0and co-founder of the Latina Futures, 2050 Lab – shared her vision for the future.\\xa0 “Together, we will tackle the most pressing social problems by taking an intersectional approach to our work.\\xa0 We must proceed in ways that are mindful of the diversity of our communities and inclusive of the voices of those often marginalized,” she said. “ We have the potential to inform social, political, and economic changes that benefit the majority of this nation.” Terriquez expressed her hope that the symposium would inspire participants to continue their advocacy and leadership. “I hope you feel energized from this weekend and will continue to fight for our communities,” she told the audience. “This is a long game, and it builds on the work that came before us.”\\xa0 Stay up-to-date on District 44's latest news, updates and more! \\nWashington D.C.

Rep. Nanette Diaz Barragán, who represents California’s 44th Congressional District, helped secure $850,000 for the nonprofit’s project. Congress members, during the 2024 fiscal year, were able to submit funding requests to the U.S. House of Representative’s Appropriations Committee for up to 15 community projects within their districts. “We’re looking forward to seeing how the money can make a difference to women and domestic violence survivors in the Long Beach area,” Barragán said in a Monday, April 22, interview. “Our focus was housing women, women empowerment and, of course, breaking the cycle — so this was an easy project to fund.” Barragán presented WomenShelter Long Beach and its various leaders with the $850,000 check during a Monday ceremony. WomenShelter Long Beach will use the funding to purchase and retrofit an existing house or apartment building, which will serve as a transitional housing facility for the nonprofit’s clients. The organization has provided crucial services for women and children since its establishment in 1977 — and offers a comprehensive suite of services for domestic violence survivors, including safe housing, emergency shelter, a 24-hour crisis hotline, counseling, legal advocacy and more. WomenShelter has yet to select a site for the new facility, according to Lisette Flores, the nonprofit’s board president. The location, when selected, won’t be shared publicly to protect future residents, Flores said in a Monday interview. “It could be in the flavor of a home, like what we have now,” Flores said, referencing WSLB’s existing emergency supportive housing shelter. “Or it could be like an apartment building where everyone has their own personal space.” Ideally, according to WomenShelter’s director of development, Nicholas Maddox, the new facility will have six to eight units — which could house multiple people, such a women and their children, to a single room. There isn’t a precise timeline for buying, retrofitting and opening the new facility, Flores said, though the goal is to have the project finished in the next six months to a year. Once open, clients will be able to live in the transitional housing facility for up to a year and the’ll also have access to case management, therapy and employment services. “I can personally say that the services and the work that our advocates do every single day makes a huge impact in everyone’s lives,” Jennifer Costa, WSLB’s director of outreach and education, said Monday. “Knowing that this continued support will be provided — it’s tremendous.” If you or someone you know is experiencing domestic violence, help is available 24/7 through the National Domestic Violence Hotline.

Bishop, Jr. (D-GA-2) recently introduced H.Con.Res. 103, legislation that would authorize the use of the U.S. Capitol Rotunda for the lying in honor of Colonel Ralph Puckett, Jr., the last living Medal of Honor recipient for acts performed during the Korean War, and would honor those who served in the Armed Forces of the U.S. during the “Forgotten War” from 1950 to 1953. The Senate companion of this legislation—S.Con.Res. 33—was approved last week by both the Senate and the House of Representatives, allowing COL Puckett to officially lie in honor in the Capitol Rotunda on April 29, 2o24. Congressman Womack said, “Honoring Colonel Ralph Puckett, Jr., the last living Medal of Honor recipient from the Korean War, and his fellow Korean War veterans is the very least we can do to display our immense gratitude for his courageous service to our country. Allowing him to lie in honor in the Capitol Rotunda will pay tribute to his remarkable heroism and provide an opportunity for all Americans to express their appreciation and respect for his service. I’m proud to join my friend Congressman Bishop in this bipartisan effort to underscore our collective recognition of Colonel Puckett’s—and all Korean War veterans’—service and sacrifice.” Congressman Bishop said, “Colonel Ralph Puckett, Jr., was a cherished member of the Columbus community. Already a highly decorated officer whose sacrifices in the line of duty helped keep our country safe, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Honor by President Biden in 2021 for his heroism during the Korean War. He remained an integral part of the U.S. Army family, taking an active role in the life of Fort Moore and its soldiers. It is only befitting that Congress bestows this honor on Colonel Puckett. I want to thank U.S. House Speaker Johnson and Senate Majority Leader Schumer for their support as well as Congressman Steve Womack of Arkansas who joins me as the Republican co-lead of this bipartisan legislation.” As a 30-year veteran of the U.S. Army National Guard and the Chairman of the West Point Board of Visitors, Congressman Womack understands the importance of supporting our military and honoring those who answered the call to serve.',\n",
       " 'TAP Into logo JERSEY SHORE- In response to growing concerns from Belmar, NJ residents over Verizon\\'s plans to install twenty 30-foot 5G towers along the local boardwalk, Representative Chris Smith introduced a new piece of legislation aimed at giving local communities more say in such telecommunications projects.\\xa0The bill, HR 8082, seeks to overturn Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations\\xa0that currently streamline the approval process for 5G infrastructure, often sidelining local input. Introduced amid escalating legal disputes involving Verizon and Monmouth County, the legislation targets specific FCC rules established in 2018. These rules include \"shot clocks\" that limit the time town and county governments have to review and approve 5G projects, which Rep. Smith argues unfairly benefit the telecommunications industry at the expense of local governance. \"The heart of my legislation is to restore the critical voice of local residents in decisions that affect the health, safety, and aesthetics of their communities,\" Rep. Smith stated. He emphasized that the advancement of technology should not trample the concerns and values of local citizens. Last year, in a letter to Verizon, Rep. Smith urged the company to reconsider its installation plans and engage more transparently with the community. His legislative action reflects broader tensions between technological expansion and community rights, emphasizing a need for balance and respect for local jurisdictions. Rep. Smith\\'s proposal resonates with broader national concerns about the pace and nature of 5G rollout across the United States, highlighting a pivotal moment in the intersection of technology, regulation, and community rights.\\n Chris has three offices dedicated to constituent services.

       " 'Jersey Shore Online-MicroMedia Publications logo \\xa0 “The Township received a $6,000,000 Congressional District Spending Grant for the Completion of the Railroad Avenue Extension from Musket to South Street and From Lacey Road south to connect into Station Drive,” said Mayor Peggy Sue Juliano. “This includes the completion of the trail.” \\xa0 Money awarded for the special federal grant can only be used for the cited projects and cannot be redirected to anything else.\\n\\r\\n\\xa0 While expressing her gratitude to Congressman Chris Smith (R-4th) for securing funds, the mayor also highlighted the project’s special significance for Lacey. She credited her husband, the late Mayor Nick Juliano, Committeeman Mark Dykoff, and now Ocean County Commissioner Gary Quinn for initiating the discussions to free up traffic on Route 9. \\xa0 The project encompasses the construction of a new two-lane limited access road running parallel to Route 9, stretching from Lacey Road South to Station Drive and from Musket Drive North to South Street. Additionally, the extension will incorporate a multi-use path known as the Barnegat Branch Rail Trail, creating a vital link in the Ocean County Barnegat Bay Trail. \\xa0 Two phases of the Railroad Avenue extension were completed in 2017 at a cost of $3 million. Authorities could not move on to further completion because of a lack of money. The start of the project reportedly freed up traffic north of Lacey Road. Sunrise Beach residents also experienced an easier means of getting in and out of their development when the road was first extended. \\xa0 Nevertheless, the fact remains that congestion is a very real concern on Route 9. \\xa0 “During peak travel time, the Route 9 corridor in Lacey Township develops heavily, leaving no alternative paths to travel to other parts of the town or its neighboring communities,” said Rep. Smith, who is said to have to have personally secured the funds for the project as one of his congressional earmarks that were signed into law as part of a negotiated budget. \\xa0 “The extension of Railroad Avenue will not only ease the flow of traffic within Lacey Township but will also improve safety conditions for drivers, passengers, and pedestrians alike,” Smith said. \\xa0 Drainage issues in the area will also be addressed as part of the overall project estimated at $6,119,345. New construction plans include drainage swales, stormwater piping, and an infiltration basin. These improvements aim to alleviate flooding during storms and enhance overall safety and efficiency for travel on Route 9 during inclement weather. \\xa0 Township Administrator Veronica Laureigh said that she spoke with Chris Smith’s office about the fact that no one was addressing the traffic on Route 9 and learned of the opportunity for congressional spending and its projected use. She encouraged members of the governing body to apply for funding. \\xa0 The end result should be completion of a road similar to McKinley Boulevard in Manahawkin that runs parallel to Route 72. The speed limit on Railroad Avenue will remain at 30 mph as required by the initial permit approving the project. \\xa0 Unlike other municipalities along the Barnegat Branch Rail Trail, Lacey owns the railroad right-of-way. The township acquired rights to the property by way of a tax foreclosure sale in 1994. Ocean County owns the land in other local towns and has used it to develop the Barnegat Rail Trail. Lacey has not turned over its portion to the County but has made an agreement as far as an access easement. \\xa0 Authorities are waiting for further information concerning when the funds will be made available and will then establish a timeline for the work.\\xa0 Chris has three offices dedicated to constituent services.

       " 'WASHINGTON – U.S. Representatives Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and Scott Peters (D-Calif.) and U.S. Senators Chris Murphy (D-Conn.)\\xa0and\\xa0Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)\\xa0on Tuesday led 14\\xa0of their Senate and House colleagues in sending a letter to Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chair Lina Khan urging the FTC to finalize a proposed rule to ban non-compete agreements as soon as possible. In their letter, the members illustrated the myriad harmful effects of non-compete agreements on both workers and the economy and highlighted the anticipated benefits of the FTC’s rule. U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and U.S. Representatives Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), Dwight Evans (D-Pa.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), Greg Casar (D-Texas),\\xa0Lizzie Fletcher (D-Texas), Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.), Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) and Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.)\\xa0also signed the letter. “The negative effects of non-compete agreements are widespread and pervasive across all sectors of the economy,”\\xa0the members wrote.\\xa0“While some special interests would have one believe non-compete agreements are essential tools for protecting sensitive business information and only affect a small handful of well-placed boardroom executives, the evidence paints a different picture. A staggering 30 million workers in the United States are bound by non-competes – a figure that represents roughly 20 percent of the American workforce. In many instances, non-competes are applied to low-wage workers even though, according to a GAO report, businesses admit these workers do not have access to confidential business information. Studies have shown that among workplaces that pay their employees an average of $13, nearly 30% of them apply non-compete agreements to their workers. For employers who are worried about their sensitive business information, other options exist. Non-disclosure agreements, for example, could be used to prevent employees from disclosing business information to their new employer.” The members continued:\\xa0“To make matters worse, workers from historically marginalized communities are often the most impacted by non-compete agreements. Research suggests that non-compete clauses lower earnings for female and nonwhite workers and that workers with less education experience greater wage loss from non-competes. Non-compete agreements have also been shown to slow innovation and hamper economic dynamism. In the last 40 years, startup growth in the United States has slowed. Research has shown that non-compete agreements reduce firm entry and spinout rates, and that firms founded in states where these agreements are in effect, are more likely to fail than those in states where non-competes are banned.” The members concluded, voicing their support for the FTC’s rule and calling for its swift finalization:\\xa0“We are pleased that the FTC is taking this much-needed step to protect workers across the country. The proposed Non-competes Clause Rule will help ensure American workers enjoy the freedom to change jobs when they want and remain free from the interference and intimidation that often comes with a non-compete agreement. In addition, the proposed rule would give employers the freedom to compete for talent, which is an essential component of a vibrant and robust job marketplace. Our economy and our country do best when wages increase, and workers can compete for better jobs and better wages. The FTC’s rule on non-compete agreements will bring a welcome change for workers across the country, and we encourage you to finalize it as soon as possible.” Read the full letter\\xa0HERE. \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIssues: Jobs, Labor, & the Economy  \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWashington, DC Office\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t2346 Rayburn House Office Building\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWashington.

       " 'FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE |\\xa0Contact: Olivia Porcaro 202-225-6165 On April 10th, I was ratified by the House Republican Conference as the new Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee - but not only did I just become the new Chairman, I also became the first Native American to ever Chair this Committee.  As an enrolled member of the Chickasaw Nation of Oklahoma, my tribal heritage is something I am very proud of, and I was very fortunate to witness this culture firsthand while growing up. My great, great grandfather served as the clerk for the Chickasaw Nation Supreme Court, my great grandfather was the Treasurer of Chickasaw Nation, my great aunt, Te Ata Fisher, was a famous actress and storyteller who performed Native American stories all over the world, and my late mother and inspiration, Helen Cole, was the first Native American woman elected to the Oklahoma State Senate.  My family members truly made it a priority of theirs to preserve tribal culture, and, as one of only five Native Americans and Alaska Natives in Congress and the first Native American House Appropriations Committee Chair, it is a top priority of mine to protect our tribes as well.   It is important to remember that Native Americans are the First Americans. They are sovereign nations who governed themselves long before settlers arrived, and they continue to do so today. Through legally binding agreements, such as the federal trust responsibility, the United States is obligated to provide services and federal resources to tribes — a responsibility I have been and will continue to work to ensure is met.   It is critical tribes and the federal government have mutual respect. States and the federal government must work with Native Americans to maintain the integrity of their heritage, culture, and rights. At the same time, the federal government must uphold its constitutional oath to tribes to provide basic resources such as healthcare, education, infrastructure, and law enforcement, among many others, in Indian Country. Tribes do not receive state assistance and cannot tax their own citizens, which is why expanding and promoting economic development within tribal communities and committing these federal resources is so important.   This is why, during my tenure as Chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development, I fought to secure historic gains for traditionally underfunded Native American housing and transportation programs. Specifically, I was able to obtain $1.34 billion for Native American housing programs and $150 million in discretionary appropriations for Tribal Transportation programs in the Fiscal Year 2024 appropriations package. Over the years, I have also fought to secure advanced appropriations funding for the Indian Health Service, ensuring that tribal communities are never at risk of losing healthcare access in the case of a government shutdown.   I have long been, and always will be, an advocate for expanding self-governance wherever possible and ensuring tribes receive the resources they need to take care of their communities because, at the end of the day, tribes are the best at taking care of their people. As Chairman of the full House Appropriations Committee, I will continue to work to set these increases as the standard for this necessary funding in the future.   Lastly, it is important that my fellow members of Congress are informed about the very unique issues concerning Native Americans, the sovereign rights of tribes, and their relationship with the federal government. As the Republican Co-Chair of the bipartisan Congressional Native American Caucus, this is exactly what I strive to do. Tribal issues span to every single House Committee, so it is important to keep Native American issues top of mind as members take up legislation.   In conclusion, tribes have played a very important role in American history. They have greatly influenced this nation and the land on which we live, even before the United States truly came to be. As the longest serving Native American in the House of Representatives, I know that it is an honor and a privilege to be a voice for tribes in Congress, and will continue to ensure that we, as a body, are protecting their autonomy and culture.

       " 'April 19, 2024 For Immediate Release Contact: Taylor Haulsee \\xa0 \\xa0 Speaker Johnson joined the Ben Shapiro Show to discuss the national security supplemental \\xa0 WASHINGTON\\xa0—\\xa0Today, Speaker Johnson joined the Ben Shapiro Show to discuss President Biden’s failed foreign policy, the House national security supplemental legislation, and the importance of America projecting strength on the world stage. \\xa0 Click here to listen to the full interview \\xa0 On American strength:  \\xa0 I believe in peace through strength. I believe in what Ronald Reagan said, it does not mean that we’re the world’s policemen. It does not mean that American troops should have boots on the ground everywhere. That’s not what we’re for. But to your point, Ben, and you’ve said it well; a strong America is good for stability around the globe. What does that mean? It means the perception of a strong America we’re the last great superpower. We, you know, we’re the greatest nation in the history of the world. It’s not even close. We’re the most free, most benevolent the strongest, the most powerful. And if we don’t act like it, then terrorists and tyrants take over. \\xa0 The reason that Iran and China and North Korea and Russia right now are acting so provocatively is because we’re projecting weakness on the world stage. Joe Biden’s foreign policy has been an absolute disaster. And that’s what’s got us in this situation. And if we do this little bit of investment here, we can stem the tide, hold them off, hopefully until we get a new president. And that day cannot happen soon enough. \\xa0 On the House’s leverage with the national security supplemental legislation: \\xa0 The House is fixing the Senate supplemental bill, the foreign aid bill that was sent to us a few months ago with better policy and better process. And so what we’ve done is we’ve taken, for example, the Ukraine funding elements that are, that are controversial, of course, on our side, we’ve added a loan instrument. We have added the, the REPO Act, which is the use of corrupt Russian oligarchs’ seized assets to support the effort there. We’ve added oversight, accountability, and a strategy shift to force the White House to give us the information and the end game and all the rest. We have an amendment process, so we can address each of these measures on their own merit in four separate bills instead of having them sandwiched together. And everybody can vote their own will and their own conscience and their own constituents. That’s the way this place is supposed to work. And we included tough measures on Russia, China, and Iran, including sanctions and some other innovation. So a very important change in both the process and the policy, and if we had not done this Ben, and this is very important, we would have had to eat the Senate supplemental if, if we had not taken this step, there would’ve been a discharge petition. And that means that a handful of Republicans would’ve crossed over and gotten on board with the Democrats to force it out of my hands and make us take the Senate supplemental as is. That was not an acceptable outcome, and this is the best possible outcome that we can achieve. \\xa0 On the vital importance of deterring Vladimir Putin: \\xa0 Look on the Ukraine piece, this is really important to point out. You know, there’s a lot of angst about, you know, quote unquote sending more money to Ukraine, but 80% of the funds that are in this package for Ukraine are literally to replenish American weapons and stocks and facilities. This is America’s defense and industrial base. This is building weapons here at home and refilling our stockpiles really, really important thing for us to do. Ukraine is in a position where they very likely would, would fall. And so this is going to allow them to, to at least hold the line. And I believe then that President Donald Trump is gonna have another term and in, in early next year if this is continuing to that point, I think he’s the one that has the strength to go in and negotiate a peace in this. But not if Russia rolls through the country, I mean, this is really important. As I said in a, in a press gaggle here the other day, to be blunt, I would rather send bullets to Ukraine than boys. You know American soldiers, we don’t want boots on the ground. We’re not the world’s policemen. If we can invest this small amount right now and achieve the desired outcome that is better for us in the long run, and it saves us a lot of money and of course, blood and toil. \\xa0 \\xa0 ### \\n\\nTags: \\n Tweet\\n Share\\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tH-232, The Capitol\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWashington, D.C. 20515\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t202-225-4000\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t ©2024 U.S. House of Representatives.

This legislation is comprised of four separate bills and provides resources to Israel, Ukraine, and the Indo-Pacific, as well as measures to counter adversaries in each region. \\xa0 “This legislation also includes enhanced oversight and accountability of U.S. taxpayer resources and includes upgrades to the Senate bill like the REPO Act and transferring portions of Ukraine aid into a loan. What we’ve done is taken the Senate supplemental bill, and we’ve improved the process and the policy, and that’s a really important thing,” Speaker Johnson said. \\xa0 Conservatives, faith leaders, advocacy organizations strongly support the legislation: \\xa0 “AIPAC strongly supports Speaker Johnson’s work to bring important national security bills to the floor, and we urge every House member to vote for crucial security aid to our ally Israel,” — \\xa0AIPAC. \\xa0 “The Israel Supplemental Appropriations Act provides critical support to a key ally facing our common enemy, Iran. This is especially true now that Iran has attacked Israel directly, not just through proxies. We call upon all Members of Congress to support the rule & the bill,” — Coalition for Jewish Values. \\xa0 “We urge all members to support the rule allowing the foreign aid bill to come to the floor so we can deliver critical emergency military assistance to Israel. Don’t tell us you stand with Israel, show us,” — Christians United for Israel. \\xa0 “In the aftermath of the October 7th Hamas massacre and Iran’s direct attack against Israel’s homeland, these votes are an especially critical test of support for the US-Israel alliance. The time to act is now,” — Republican Jewish Coalition. \\xa0 “We welcome the release of the House of Representatives’ security supplemental package, which includes a number of vital measures that AJC has long advocated for, such as security assistance to our allies Israel and Ukraine, and funding for the Nonprofit Security Grant Program to keep Jewish communities in the U.S. safe. We urge its swift passage,” — American Jewish Committee. \\xa0 “It is absolutely critical that Christians in America and around the world stand with Israel, protect Israel’s right to defend itself, and work to contain this conflict so that it doesn’t threaten global peace. We stand with Israel,” — Family Research Council. \\xa0 “The leadership of Speaker Mike Johnson has been crucial in defending life, religious freedom, fiscal responsibility, and important allies like Israel. He always stands strong and we’re proud to stand with him,” — Center for Urban Renewal. \\xa0 “As former Secretary of State and former Vice Chief of Staff of the Army we write at a pivotal moment in our nation’s history to applaud your efforts to secure vital support to America’s allies and to strengthen America’s defenses,” — Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo & Vice Chief of Staff to the Army Jack Keane. \\xa0 “Speaker Mike Johnson is a man of incredible character, who has unequivocally shown his support of protecting the unborn, the family, and standing strong with one of our greatest allies, Israel. In light of Iran’s unprecedented attack against Israel last week, we must ensure that every Republican is supportive of the Speaker’s efforts to bring Israel funding to the finish line as quickly as possible. CWALAC supports Speaker Johnson and his efforts to support Israel,” — Concerned Women for America LAC. \\xa0 “Last week, the ERLC sent a letter to Speaker Johnson & all members of Congress urging them to pass critical support for Ukraine. While there are some political headwinds, I’m grateful Mike Johnson is moving forward to help Ukraine defend itself against Putin’s illegal invasion,” — Brent Leatherwood, Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission President.  \\xa0 “This supplemental package includes bills that the CCP, Russia, and the Islamic Republic of Iran all vehemently oppose, it will be devastating to our enemies if this passes,” — POLARIS. \\xa0 “A resilient U.S. DIB and a strong network of U.S. allies and partners form the foundation of U.S. national deterrence in a rapidly evolving strategic environment. On behalf of NDIA’s members, I commend the House leadership for supporting these necessary investments and urge swift passage,” — David Norquist, National Defense Industry Association President. \\xa0 “The bill to force China to divest from TikTok may soon be on the President’s desk. Thank you Speaker Johnson for your leadership,” — Foundation for American Innovation. \\xa0 “FDD Action endorses the supplemental funding package put forward today by Speaker Mike Johnson. We urge members of Congress on both sides of the aisle to support it along with the underlying rule. America’s adversaries are watching. The authoritarian axis of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Russia, and the Chinese Communist Party are challenging U.S. interests like never before. It is imperative that both chambers of the Congress act with urgency to provide critical support to Israel, Taiwan, and Ukraine. These nations are on the front lines of a generation-defining fight for freedom and prosperity, and their success is inextricably linked to our own national security. This legislation paves the way for targeted investments with strong oversight in our allies and partners that will enhance their military capabilities, deter America’s adversaries, and contain the spread of even costlier conflicts,” — Foundation for Defense of Democracies Action. \\xa0 “In supporting U.S. assistance to Ukraine, Israel, and allies in the Indo-Pacific, Speaker Johnson channels President Ronald Reagan. Speaking to Congress in 1985, President Reagan declared, ‘We must stand by all our democratic allies. And we must not break faith with those who are risking their lives,’” — Ronald Reagan Institute. \\xa0 “We should all call our congressmen and urge them to pass aid to stop Putin, to help Israel, to strengthen Taiwan and to close the border. I am especially glad that the REPO act has been included to use Russian money to pay for defeating Putin,” — Former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich. \\xa0 “America is the leader of the free world and I would call on all my old friends in the Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, to rally around Speaker Johnson as he brings legislation to the floor to do America’s part to renew our support for Ukraine, for Israel, for Taiwan, and for freedom in the world,” — Former Vice President Mike Pence. \\xa0 ### \\n\\nTags: \\n Tweet\\n Share\\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tH-232, The Capitol\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWashington, D.C. 20515\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t202-225-4000\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t ©2024 U.S. House of Representatives.

       " 'April 19, 2024 For Immediate Release Contact: Taylor Haulsee \\xa0 Speaker delivers remarks following House vote on rule \\xa0 WASHINGTON\\xa0—\\xa0Following a 316-94 vote on the procedural rule to allow amendments and debate on the House national security supplemental, Speaker Johnson delivered brief remarks to press off the House floor: \\xa0 “The Senate sent us effectively a blank check for foreign aid, and that was not going to work for the policy or the process in the House. It is a better process to break the bills up into four separate measures for consideration and that is what we will have tomorrow. Everyone can vote their will and their constituents desires on Israel aid, the Ukrainian aid, the Indo-Pacific, and our fourth national security package that has all of the innovations in it. \\xa0 “Because we did this process, we got a better outcome. There are a lot of innovations that the Senate didn’t consider. We include the REPO Act, which as you know is the use of corrupt Russian oligarchs’ assets to help fund the resistance in Ukraine. We introduced the loan concept for the governmental assistance part to be provided a loan, instead of a gift. We also included some really important sanctions on Russia and China and Iran, which I believe is the new axis of evil, and many of us do. They are the ones who are the aggressors in this situation. \\xa0 “The reality here is that if the House did not do this better policy and process, allowing for amendments on the floor in the process tomorrow, we would have had to eat the Senate supplemental bill. And that is because we were very close, given the timeline of both Israel and Ukraine, to a discharge petition being brought. And a discharge petition, in layman’s terms, is when a number of members or a majority of members get together, they can override the Speaker and bring something straight to the floor. That would have happened imminently on the Senate supplemental. \\xa0 “So, by doing this, even though it’s not the perfect legislation, it’s not the legislation that we would write if Republicans were in charge of both the House, the Senate, and the White House, this is the best possible product that we can get under these circumstances to take care of these really important obligations. And so, we look forward to the vote tomorrow. We look forward to every member voting their conscience and their desire. And that is exactly how this process is supposed to work and how the House is supposed to operate. We’re happy to provide that and we’ll give you more comment tomorrow.” \\xa0 ### \\n\\nTags: \\n Tweet\\n Share\\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tH-232, The Capitol\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWashington, D.C. 20515\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t202-225-4000\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t ©2024 U.S. House of Representatives.

       " 'April 20, 2024 For Immediate Release Contact: Taylor Haulsee \\xa0 “We gave our members a voice. We gave them a better process and ultimately a much better policy.” \\xa0 WASHINGTON\\xa0—\\xa0Today, following House passage of the national security supplemental, Speaker Johnson delivered remarks to press off the House floor. \\xa0 Watch Speaker Johnson’s full remarks here \\xa0 Read below for the full transcript of Speaker Johnson’s remarks: \\xa0 The House has worked its will. These are not normal times here in the House or around the world as we all know, and we saw the disturbance here on the House floor just a bit ago. I just want to say simply what I think most people around the country understand and agree, we should only wave one flag on the House floor. And I think we know which flag that is. \\xa0 I said these are not normal times, they’re not, the world is destabilized and it’s a tinderbox. It’s a dangerous time. Three of our primary adversaries, Russia, Iran, and China are working together, and they’re being aggressors around the globe. And they’re a global threat to our prosperity and our security. Their advance threatens the free world, and it demands American leadership. If we turn our backs right now the consequences could be devastating. \\xa0 So, this afternoon, the House acted and we sent over to the Senate – it will be transmitted shortly – our supplemental national security legislation and make no mistake, this is not a blank check like the Senate supplemental bill was. This is very different. Instead of taking the path of least resistance and bringing up the Senate supplemental on the House floor, or just allowing a discharge petition to come forward – which would have had the same outcome – we gave our members a voice. We gave them a chance. We gave them a better process, and ultimately a much better policy. \\xa0 Unlike the Senate’s blank check, the House legislation has a number of very important features. It provides for greater accountability over Ukraine aid.\\xa0 It forces an end-game strategy for the Ukraine war. It includes a loan instrument of this foreign aid to Ukraine and the REPO act to ensure that Russian assets pay for part of the bill. And unlike the Senate’s bill, the loan system itself is a House innovation, and allows for much needed insight. And remember that 80% of the Ukraine funding will go to the replenishment of American weapons and stocks and our facilities and our operations. \\xa0 It also includes tough measures and sanctions on Iran and Russia and China, which most of the American people understand is a necessity and a very important thing. Our process in the end ensured that each member was able to consider the individual supplemental elements on their own merits, which is exactly how the House is supposed to work. \\xa0 I know there are critics of the legislation, I understand that it is not a perfect piece of legislation. We’re not insured that in a time of divided government and at a time where there are lots of different opinions, but there is no question whatsoever that the House has made many strong improvements to the Senate bill. And the product that we’ve sent over there is much better. This package, I will note because it’s very important, also includes national security priorities and many of them, but it is the only way that we could have gotten Democrats to support aid to Israel. And that’s a fact. \\xa0 There is a lot of misinformation out there about the bill. And I just want to make one point about one issue that has drawn a lot of attention and that is could any of this funding go to Hamas or to terrorist organizations or what have you. And we put safeguards in the legislation to ensure that UNRWA is not funded, the UN agency that included terrorists who participated in the October 7th attack on Israel. We’ve also had language that prevents it from going in either funding going to Hamas, or any other bad actors. That’s a very important element of oversight. Congress takes the oversight very seriously. And we will continue to keep an eye on every dollar that we’re using and investing at this time. \\xa0 I’ve said it very simply. I’ll say it once again. It’s an old military adage, but we would rather send bullets to the conflict overseas than our own boys, our troops. And I think this is an important moment and important opportunity to make that decision. We allowed the House to do that. And I expect the Senate will make the same decision. \\xa0 Background: \\xa0 ### \\n\\nTags: \\n Tweet\\n Share\\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tH-232, The Capitol\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWashington, D.C. 20515\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t202-225-4000\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t ©2024 U.S. House of Representatives.

       " 'April 20, 2024 For Immediate Release Contact: Taylor Haulsee \\xa0 WASHINGTON\\xa0—\\xa0Read the RealClearPolitics profile of Speaker Mike Johnson, “A Beleaguered Gentleman: Speaker Mike Johnson,” out today at RealClearPolitics.com. \\xa0 “You assume risk when you take this job. We don’t back away from risk. I’m going to do the right thing,” Johnson says as storm clouds – literal ones, not just the political variety – roll in… After all, the speaker continues, “what is popular isn’t always right; what’s right isn’t always popular.” \\xa0 A Beleaguered Gentleman: Speaker Mike Johnson RealClearPolitics Philip Wegmann April 20, 2024 \\xa0 The sky is cloudless and blue on a warm April afternoon as a cheerful Mike Johnson, seated on a beige couch next to an unlit fireplace in an office still new to him, contemplates his demise, taking solace in Providence and repeating the words of John Quincy Adams – an illustration of his circumstances almost as much as a reluctant acceptance of fate: \\xa0 “Duty is ours. Results are God’s.” \\xa0 The future of the 56th speaker of the House of Representatives also belongs to the Almighty, if not a small cadre of his fellow Republicans. Johnson admits as much in an interview with RealClearPolitics on Monday when asked if he’s prepared to risk his speakership over sending war aid to Ukraine. \\xa0 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has warned that his country will lose to Russia unless the United States approves more military aid. Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, meanwhile, has promised the speaker that he will lose his job if Congress does exactly that. \\xa0 “You assume risk when you take this job. We don’t back away from risk. I’m going to do the right thing,” Johnson says as storm clouds – literal ones, not just the political variety – roll in. Financing a land war wasn’t “some minor measure on tax policy,” he adds. It instead has “implications for the entire world.” Afterall, the speaker continues, “what is popular isn’t always right; what’s right isn’t always popular.” \\xa0 Johnson pauses at that, smiling sheepishly at the “bumper sticker slogan” he’s uttered. Thunder and rain follow the interview, and the storm now follows the speaker as he struggles to survive. He has a possible coup on his hands, and the party leader whom barely anyone really knows could soon be toppled. \\xa0 The Louisiana Republican’s path to the speakership was the product of chaos after Kevin McCarthy was ousted last October through a motion to vacate, a parliamentary rule that allows a single member to force a vote to remove the speaker. After a unanimous Democratic Party House conference joined forces with eight conservative GOP renegades, McCarthy was out and the ad hoc effort to find his replacement began. More seasoned Republicans volunteered for the job. Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana. Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan of Ohio. Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota. All fell short, one by one. \\xa0 The fourth nominee was different. “We were finally just so sick of it,” recalls Texas Rep. Michael McCaul, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, “that we all threw our hands up, and said we don’t have anything against this guy. Let’s just go with him.” Three weeks of infighting ended when the conservative and centrist wings of the GOP made peace. Congress elected Johnson, the vice chair of the GOP caucus, the lowest man on the leadership totem pole, by a party-line vote of\\xa0 220-209. “I never aspired to it,” he says of the position. His family hadn’t planned on it either. Johnson’s wife, Kelly, couldn’t catch a flight to D.C. in time to see her husband sworn in. \\xa0 The New York Times described him as “conservative hard-liner beloved by the far right” who was little-known other than his record as a lawyer and legislator, punctuated by gently articulated opposition to abortion, homosexuality, and gay marriage. His election, the paper reported in a breaking news bulletin, “further cemented the Republican Party’s lurch to the right.” \\xa0 Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters he had never met Johnson. White House aides scrambled to Google the man just elected second-in-line to the presidency. The conservatives who knew of him were ecstatic. \\xa0 Johnson introduced himself by telling Congress that they had cast the votes, but the decision had come from above. Leaning on Scripture, the new speaker said in his acceptance speech “that God has ordained and allowed each one of us to be brought here for this specific moment in time.” The House assented with polite, if not occasionally bemused, applause. “It’s not like his value set is hidden,” says Tony Perkins, the president of the conservative Family Research Council, who hired Johnson out of law school as an aide in the Louisiana\\xa0 legislature. “You don’t need a decoder ring. Want to know his positions? Read the Bible.” \\xa0 And Johnson does look, and he often sounds, like a Sunday school teacher. In dozens of interviews with colleagues, friends, and contemporaries, none could recall the bookish lawyer ever raising his voice in anger. “He has the decorum of a Southern gentleman in the DNA,” insists Rep. Clay Higgins, a Louisiana Republican and Freedom Caucus member who calls the speaker “my brother.” He is also a creature of the right, best known before politics as a litigator who filed an amicus brief to the Supreme Court in defense of “traditional marriage” on behalf of the conservative analogue of the ACLU, a group called Alliance Defending Freedom. \\xa0 “I don’t know how Rayburn felt about IVF,” jokes South Dakota Rep. Dusty Johnson, who chairs the Main Street Caucus, a group of more moderate Republicans in Congress, “but I think it’s safe to say that Mike Johnson is the most conservative speaker in modern political history.” \\xa0 A Leadership Newcomer \\xa0 He can offer more than devotions and hallway homilies, however. A constitutional law attorney, Johnson ingrained himself in the Republican Study Committee when he came to Congress in 2017 and was later elected chairman of the group that churns out white papers as the GOP’s in-house conservative think tank. “He possesses tremendous intellectual firepower,” says Alabama Rep. Gary Palmer, the fifth ranking Republican in the House. Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana describes Johnson in a way the speaker himself never would: “He pisses excellence.” \\xa0 But an impressive resume is no guarantee of success. Johnson had little leadership experience, other than scheduling the one-minute floor speeches members make in the morning to an empty House chamber. He certainly hadn’t negotiated anything of consequence. On his first full day in the job, the rookie speaker sat across the table in the White House Situation Room with President Biden, a man who first ran for the U.S. Senate the year Johnson was born. They’d never previously met. \\xa0 “That’s a pretty tall order, especially when you’re brand new as a speaker,” recalls McCaul, who accompanied Johnson to negotiations at the White House three months later. The speaker, still green but growing, held forth to demand Biden defend not just Ukrainian territory but America’s own border. “It was almost like the newly elected junior speaker was growing into the position by educating the president,” McCaul says of Johnson’s lecture to Biden about executive actions that could be taken, sans Congress, to slow the surge of illegal crossings. \\xa0 “We understand that there’s concern about the safety, security and sovereignty of Ukraine,” Johnson told reporters after the meeting wrapped, “but the American people have those same concerns about our own domestic sovereignty and our safety and our security.” \\xa0 The lesson did not stick. Biden has not taken executive action on the border. Congress has not approved more aid Ukraine either. Conservative hopes of forcing Democrats to swallow beefed up border security in exchange for more war funding dimmed and now seem out of reach. \\xa0 “Mike Johnson has constantly been calling me ‘a friend,’” Greene complains. “I don’t even know Mike Johnson!” She has haunted the speaker for months, promising to topple him with the same motion to vacate that ended McCarthy’s tenure if Johnson moves more Ukraine aid. “He’s not a friend of mine.” MTG, as Greene is often referred to, details during an interview with RealClearPolitics the alleged sins of the speaker against MAGA. They are many. \\xa0 MTG isn’t just angry about efforts to underwrite the land war in Europe. She is furious about the spending bills that Johnson helped muscle through with Democratic support to avoid a government shutdown, legislative behemoths that ballooned the deficit, and worst of all in her mind, funded the Department of Justice that’s bringing charges against the former president. \\xa0 “Johnson funded that,” she fumes. “They want to kill Trump,” she said of the myriad of indictments brought by the DOJ. “They want him to die in jail!” \\xa0 “MAGA, Christian, conservative,” Greene continues, rattling off the resume Johnson presented to the conference. “He has completely betrayed all three of those identities.” \\xa0 Johnson is barely six months into the job. His colleagues report that the Southern Baptist doesn’t drink, smoke, or cuss. But hardliners like Greene complain that he doesn’t fight either. \\xa0 “Well,” Johnson replies, back in his office, “that’s just not accurate.” With Trump’s blessing, he helped smother a bipartisan border deal deemed insufficiently conservative. The House also impeached Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas over his handling of the border. But on spending, the past isn’t dead, he says in so many words. It isn’t even past, as Faulkner might add. Instead, Johnson says he was bequeathed a cursed dowry from McCarthy. \\xa0 “I inherited a budget deal made by my predecessor that was unchangeable,” he explains. With one half of one third of government barely under his control, the speaker reports running into a brick wall while negotiating with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jefferies and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Republican minority leader, wasn’t any help either. \\xa0 “I was reminded very quickly by the other three of the four corners that ‘No, the deal was made,’” Johnson says in recapping weeks of negotiations. \\xa0 “It doesn’t apply to me,” he shot back. \\xa0 “‘Oh, yes, it does. It’s the House’s deal,’” they replied. “So, we did the best we could within that to fight for our policy priorities,” Johnson sighs, “and we got many of them.” But his right flank isn’t satisfied by wins on the margin, despite one of the slimmest majority margins in U.S history. \\xa0 Walking a Narrow Path \\xa0 Enter coalition government, where the byword is compromise, a liability for Johnson when conservatives consider bipartisanship a bitter poison. \\xa0 The speaker holds the majority, yes, but only by a margin of 218 to 213. More than a quarter of his caucus, 55 Republicans, a recent Wall Street Journal analysis found, consistently vote against major government spending bills. To get around his right flank’s objections, and to keep the government from shutting down, Johnson has resorted to a maneuver called suspension of the rules, which requires a two-thirds supermajority of votes. A majority of Democrats, not Republicans, have supplied needed votes. Of course, Johnson could have thrown a Hail Mary. He could have threatened a shutdown to try and force the White House and Senate to his will. \\xa0 “The people who are the most frustrated about the spending process wanted us to shut the government down,” Johnson explains. “They fail to acknowledge the reality that a government shutdown would not behoove the country or our chances to prevail in November.” If he had cast his lot with the hardliners and the government went dark, Johnson insists, it would have “backfired” and given “the White House all the cards.” \\xa0 This pains the speaker. He sees himself as a conservative, and not so long ago he regularly broke bread with the Freedom Caucus. “They are some of my best friends,” he said years ago when running for RSC chairman, describing “the tremendous amount of respect” he had for how those hardliners thwarted then-Speaker Paul Ryan’s plans to pass a watered-down version of Obamacare repeal. He was right there with them trying to jam the speaker. He hated the parliamentary tricks leadership played, especially the thousand-page bills dropped overnight on the rank-and-file. “I didn’t sign up to do legislation that way,” Johnson complained. He was an insurgent – though a polite one. \\xa0 Barely finished with his freshman year, Johnson was accustomed to “the arm-wrestling routine.” In the newsroom of the conservative Washington Examiner, the lawmaker nobody knew praised a robust back-and-forth. “We never compromise our core principles,” he said then of how conservatives ought to legislate, “but you have to compromise your preferences sometimes.” Almost as an afterthought, he added, “otherwise, the system breaks down.” \\xa0 It was the summer of 2018. With unified government, Republicans could afford to squabble a bit,\\xa0 up until the point they lost the House and then the White House and Senate. One thing Johnson vowed never to change: a promise to his family. “When I go home,” he explained, “I want to look my kids in the eye and tell them that daddy acted like a gentleman.” \\xa0 This past March, Johnson felt he owed Biden an apology. Seated just over the president’s shoulder during the State of the Union address, the speaker couldn’t mask his expressions of exhaustion and exasperation as Biden laid into Republicans. The two next met on Capitol Hill for the Friends of Ireland luncheon where Johnson toasted Biden as “America’s most famous Irishman.” On loan from the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, his pint glass was the same one Reagan used during a 1984 visit to Ireland. The Guinness the Southern Baptist speaker drank was non-alcoholic. \\xa0 Johnson pulled Biden aside to “apologize for the eye-roll memes that went around the world.” The president laughed, then told the speaker he was glad Johnson was better behaved than Nancy Pelosi had been during the speeches of his predecessor: “I’m just grateful you didn’t rip my speech up.” The speaker replied, “Well, Mr. President, don’t think my friends back home didn’t want me to light it on fire.” \\xa0 It may have been a missed opportunity. A little arson might have endeared him to the bomb throwers in his caucus. Former Speaker Newt Gingrich recently commiserated that the current speaker was leading “the most complicated House since the Civil War,” a sentiment Johnson doesn’t dispute. “It is an extraordinary time of challenge,” he says as members of his own party plot against him. \\xa0 “We’re going through a valley right now,” Johnson insists, “but I’m very bullish on the November election cycle, and I believe we’re going to be in a much better place on the other side of this.” He himself may not make it. The life spans of Republican speakers are shrinking. Predecessors John Boehner, Ryan, and McCarthy were run out of town due to rebellions, exhaustion, or a mix of both. \\xa0 Democrats don’t seem to have the same problem, a fact not lost on Johnson. On the other side of the aisle, he sees a party that “thinks like a union, they really do. They think as collectivists, as a body, and it’s easier to move them as social animals.” The Party of Lincoln, on the other hand, is made up of “rugged individualists by nature. We are deeply principled, and we just don’t yield as easily.” This is “a great blessing” Johnson says, “but it’s also a great challenge when you have a single-vote margin in a legislative body where you need everybody to work and move in the same direction.” When combined with a 24-hour news cycle and compounded by social media, he continues, “there are challenges right now that no previous speaker has had to contend with.” \\xa0 Greene filed her motion to vacate with the House clerk right before Congress left for Easter recess. She chose not to privilege the resolution, which would have triggered an immediate floor vote, referring to the motion instead as “more of a warning than a pink slip.” What has followed, according to one senior GOP aide, is an exercise in “Nixon-era Mad Men theory.” The question is not if, but when, a challenge will come. \\xa0 “If we vacate the chair a second time, there is no one who could successfully lead this conference. No one. That person does not exist, not only in the House. They don’t exist in this country,” Dusty Johnson, the moderate Republican, groaned. He added, “If we are so broken that we are going to perform this Greek tragedy a second time, then what a clown show.” \\xa0 “I consider Marjorie Taylor Greene to be my friend. She’s still my friend,” Higgins said in a video cut straight to social media shortly after the motion to vacate was filed, “but she just made a big mistake.” A member of the Freedom Caucus, Higgins split with GOP brass on both spending packages and opposes more funding for Ukraine. He still backs the speaker, however. “Brotherhood is the respect that you extend to your brother to fight his fight,” Higgins says of the withering criticism Johnson now faces. “He’s never been attacked the way that he is suffering now that he’s the speaker, which is almost an impossible job in the best of circumstances.” \\xa0 “People get pissed off up here, brother, and they say shit they don’t mean,” Higgins says of Greene’s assertion that the speaker betrayed his Christian identity. “Character,” he added, “really emerges when you do not smash somebody who has given you cause to smash them.” \\xa0 Johnson has not retaliated against members of his party for defying his leadership, and there was a feeling that Greene’s revolt might be a mutiny of one. Then Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican and perennial thorn in the side of each speaker he has served with, co-sponsored the motion to vacate and called on Johnson to resign. Asked what the final straw was, foreign aid or a recent bill renewing FISA, Massie responded on Twitter “all of the above.” The libertarian added, “This camel has a pallet of bricks.” \\xa0 ‘Code of Faith’ \\xa0 His sudden elevation brought with it an evolution for Johnson. As a member of the Judiciary Committee, he once railed against what he saw as abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Then Johnson walked into a sensitive compartmented information facility. \\xa0 “We got so spun up and so frustrated by it, at one point, we thought about getting rid of the statute,” he recalls of his initial frustrations with FISA as a rank-and-file member. “And then I went to the skiff,” says the man now second in line to the presidency, “and heard classified briefings and how critically important it is to national security.” It was conversations with the likes of former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former House Intel Chair Devin Nunes that changed his mind. “They said, ‘We’ve gotta have it; this is why we haven’t had another 9/11 on our shores.’” With their counsel, Johnson explains, “I became a champion of that. I don’t want innocent Americans to die.” \\xa0 And prior to picking up the gavel, Johnson never supported aid for Ukraine either. \\xa0 “I really do believe the intel and in the briefings that we’ve gotten,” Johnson told reporters ahead of the vote on a foreign assistance plan now seemingly tied to his own fate. “I believe Xi and Vladimir Putin and Iran really are an axis of evil,” he said, warning that Moscow could potentially move further into Europe if not stopped in Ukraine. “To put it bluntly, I would rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys.” \\xa0 After a bruising fight with his own party to renew FISA, but before bringing Ukraine funding to the floor for a vote, the speaker decamped for Mar-a-Lago. The meeting with former President Donald Trump had been on the books for weeks, he says. Unlike the rest of Washington, Trump already knows Johnson well. \\xa0 Like most Republicans, Johnson has a favorite Trump story. Before becoming speaker, he did a pretty decent Trump impression. They first spoke when the congressman was himself jamming GOP leadership, refusing to vote for an Obamacare repeal package that didn’t go far enough in his estimation. The call came one morning as Johnson was finishing his devotions in his office (where he lived). The president wanted him to vote yes on the bill. The congressman stubbornly explained why he had to vote no. \\xa0 His Bible was open to the Book of Daniel at the time, Johnson was once fond of telling friends, specifically the passage where Daniel interprets the dreams of Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar. And the congressman felt compelled to tell Trump that, once their call ended, he would pray for the president. The line went quiet. Trump broke the silence: “Tell God, I say hi.” \\xa0 Johnson still lives in his office when he’s in Washington, although he has since dropped the impression. And either incidentally or by design, the former president offered the speaker a lifeline. “He’s doing a really good job under very tough circumstances, and I appreciate that he came to Mar-a-Lago,” Trump said of Johnson at a press conference. But what about his most faithful disciple in Congress? Trump reiterated that Johnson was doing “about as good as you’re going to do,” adding that “I’m sure Marjorie understands that.” \\xa0 For the speaker, the press conference couldn’t have gone any better. “We delivered the message we needed to deliver,” he says. The trip was important, he adds, because it demonstrated “a unified front for our party,” showing “that our soon-to-be nominee for president and the House leadership here, and the speaker, are 100% in line on our agenda.” \\xa0 Trump and Johnson – whom the former president once dubbed “MAGA Mike” – couldn’t be more different in temperament. Trump, for instance, once remarked that his greatest contribution to the GOP might just be that he taught Republicans to fight. Johnson, for his part, likely wishes they’d stop fighting one another. \\xa0 In March, at the sprawling Greenbriar Resort in the mountains of West Virginia, Emmer sought a pragmatic peace. “We don’t have to like each other; we have to respect one another,” he told Republicans gathered for the GOP policy retreat. \\xa0 “I have to differ with the whip,” Johnson told the conference, “the Bible teaches us to love one another even if we don’t like each other.” \\xa0 “I can’t imagine John Boehner saying something like that without everyone laughing,” McCaul said of the former speaker famous for smoking Camels and swirling Merlot while in Congress and later lobbying for weed industry once out of it. “But everyone knows Mike is sincere.” \\xa0 It wasn’t his first sermon. At another retreat, this one in Miami the month before, an exasperated GOP member anonymously griped to Politico about the speaker’s scriptural references: “I’m not at church.” The press was far less charitable. There isn’t much dirt on Johnson. But there was plenty of gawking at the strange Southern gentleman who makes no secret of his faith. \\xa0 Slate asserted that his covenant marriage, an arrangement not uncommon among evangelicals that sets a higher bar for divorce, reflected a “radical marital strategy.” The New Republic mistook a passing remark about prayer during his acceptance speech as “a gross gaffe.” Rolling Stone implied that Johnson and his son’s use of software to filter out explicit material online was somehow meant to do the opposite. \\xa0 The speaker isn’t angry at such clueless coverage. He is just disappointed. What he is espousing in his personal life, without mandating it for anyone else, Johnson believes, isn’t all that different than what was normal in previous generations, or just a few decades ago. Namely, the expectation that lawmakers have “a moral center,” he says, adding, “Washington doesn’t know what to do with a person who actually lives by a code of faith and doesn’t just talk about it.” \\xa0 But the more extreme MAGA apologists see things differently. “If we’re gonna be biblical,” Greene says in her office, “we can say we’re supposed to judge them by the fruit they bear, right?” The congresswoman, who recently pointed to an earthquake and the solar eclipse as signs of coming divine judgement, is no less religious in her own way. “God isn’t afraid of battle or conflict,” she notes, citing the story of Jesus driving the money changers out of the temple. “Anger,” she concludes, “can be righteous.” \\xa0 A Way Forward? \\xa0 But anger doesn’t counter arithmetic erosion. The GOP majority has been evaporating as members retire early rather than serve out their full terms, and Johnson can now only lose one vote on legislation. The defining story of his speakership, explains Dusty Johnson, is just “what a lousy hand of cards he was dealt.” \\xa0 “If this was a movie,” the South Dakota congressman says, there would be a moment where the speaker would walk onto the House floor and deliver a speech so perfect that “through sheer force of oratory, he would bend the will of the United States government. That is not the way real progress happens in democratic republic.” \\xa0 A final tragedy or early triumph for Johnson may be imminent. His far right wing is in open rebellion over a foreign aid package that does not include border security reforms. Challengers are reportedly lining up support to replace him. Leadership elections, and the chaos that follows, loom. Would he remove the sword that dangles above his head? \\xa0 “Having a single motion, I don’t think anyone in the building believes that’s a good idea because it creates a real hindrance to the process itself,” Johnson says in his office this past Monday. It shouldn’t be just erased in the next Congress, he continues: “There should be a motion, but the threshold should be higher. And I think 99% of the people here probably agree.” \\xa0 Another avenue of temporary salvation exists. An ironic one. Some on the left have vowed publicly that they would ride to the rescue of the most socially conservative speaker in recent memory. Does he have any faith in those promises? \\xa0 “I have lots of friends in the building,” the speaker says, and “I’ve had a handful of Democrats approach me on the floor and say, ‘Hey, don’t worry about the motion to vacate.’” He doesn’t entertain those conversations, Johnson insists. \\xa0 The speaker was swept into office in an instant, and he could leave just as quickly. There was hope that Johnson could lead Republicans out of the wilderness, that he could hold together a fractured caucus long enough not just to maintain but grow the GOP majority. He still might. The speaker came into leadership trusting in Providence, and he now trusts his fate to the same. \\xa0 “We are actually called to bless even those who persecute us and return good for evil,” he says, citing biblical admonishment when asked about the attacks on his character. “And I get a lot of practice in all of that every day now, more than I aspire to.” \\xa0 “I don’t hold grudges,” he says. “I easily forgive, and that’s required a lot these days.” This, the speaker says as his fate remains uncertain, “is a liberating way to live.” \\xa0 ### \\n\\nTags: \\n Tweet\\n Share\\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tH-232, The Capitol\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWashington, D.C. 20515\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t202-225-4000\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t ©2024 U.S. House of Representatives.

The funding will help BECMA’s efforts to support small Black-owned businesses and Black entrepreneurs through technical assistance and other tools and services. “For generations, Black families have been systematically denied the opportunity to build wealth, and this precise, intentional federal investment in our Black small business owners and entrepreneurs will help us close the glaring racial wealth gap right here in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts” said Rep. Pressley. “As representative for one of the most unequal districts in this country, I am proud to have secured this robust funding alongside my colleague Senator Warren to help our communities thrive.” “BECMA’s work to help address the Black wealth gap in the Commonwealth is powerfully important, and this federal funding that Rep. Ayanna Pressley, Senator Markey and I helped secure is one of the best ways we can continue to support BECMA’s crucial mission of supporting Black-owned businesses,” said Sen. Warren. “I was delighted to celebrate this funding today and I’m going to keep fighting for federal investments and efforts to help close the Black wealth gap.” Congresswoman Pressley and Senator Warren were joined at the roundtable by BECMA President Nicole Obi and Black small business owners supported by BECMA’s Back Office Support Services (BOSS) program. “The Black Economic Council of Massachusetts is thankful for Congresswoman Pressley and Senator Warren’s leadership in securing BECMA $1 million in federal funding to help us continue our work to build and sustain Black wealth across the Commonwealth,” said Nicole Obi, President and CEO at the Black Economic Council of Massachusetts. “This critical funding supports BECMA’s Back Office Support Services (BOSS) program, which provides our members with access to working capital grants, digital tools, and professional services to help them launch and scale their firms.” “We are so grateful to Congresswoman Pressley and Senator Warren for prioritizing support for small, diverse businesses like ours,” said Denise O’Marde, Owner of Cafe Juice Up in Mattapan. “We are also deeply appreciative to our BECMA family for providing us access to the critical resources and services that help us stabilize our operations and thrive.” “Thank you to Congresswoman Pressley and Senator Warren for advocating for organizations like BECMA that support Black-owned businesses,” said Shana Bryant, Founder and CEO of Shana Bryant Consulting. “BECMA has provided invaluable\\xa0support to my firm that expanded our HR infrastructure and capacity, including a $10,000 BOSS grant that helped to cover the interest for a financing loan.” “Thank you to BECMA for providing support for my business at a critical time and to Rep. Pressley and Senator Warren for their leadership,” said Abdllahi “Mash” Abdirahman, Founder and Owner of Butterfly Falafel. “I encourage them to continue to prioritize diversity, equity, and inclusion in their work and to ensure that federal funding reaches Black businesses and communities directly.” Footage from the roundtable and press conference can be found here, and photos are here. Rep. Pressley\\xa0secured the federal funding\\xa0for the program in the Fiscal Year 2023 government spending package that passed Congress and was signed into law by President Biden in December 2022.

       " 'Today, Congressman Henry Cuellar, Ph.D. (TX-28) announced $3,120,000 in federal funds for schoolyard forestry in Laredo. The funds, awarded by the Texas A&M Forestry Service, were made possible by the Inflation Reduction Act, which Dr. Cuellar helped pass in 2022. “Quality campus amenities encourage a positive learning environment for our students. The funds announced today for the Adelante con Arboles project will deliver a unique urban forestry solution for Laredo students as they learn more about the natural wonders of our world,” said Dr. Cuellar. “I applaud the Texas A&M Forest Service for utilizing federal dollars made available through the Inflation Reduction Act to invest in South Texas. Thank you to Dr. Sylvia Guerra Rios, Superintendent of LISD, and Tricia Cortez, Executive Director of RGISC, for working with me to secure these funds for Laredo students.” “Beyond beautifying our schools, these trees will play an important role in making our campuses feel more welcoming and attractive,” stated LISD Superintendent of Schools Dr. Sylvia G. Rios. “Our students will watch these trees grow and connect them to their fond memories of their educational experience at LISD.” “More importantly, these trees will also serve as useful tools to teach our students about the world around them and the importance as well as responsibility we all share in nurturing our environment,” Dr. Rios exclaimed. “We are so grateful to be the recipients of such a generous grant, and as such, we are committed to working alongside our community partners to positively impact the world in which we live,” reiterated Dr. Rios. “This is a special day for such an announcement; not only is it taking place on Earth Day, but it represents a new step forward for our South Texas border city. This Laredo project was one of only five selected from across Texas, and it speaks to the commitment of our community to increase native tree canopy at Laredo ISD, provide outdoor learning opportunities for students, and begin to address climate change and severe urban heat island in the inner city,” said Tricia Cortez, Executive Director of RGISC. This award will help the Laredo Independent School District (LISD) and Rio Grande International Study Center (RGISC) implement their Adelante con Arboles project to plant trees and increase tree canopy coverage by 30% across eight Laredo schools: The project will provide students with greater opportunities for outdoor education, raise environmental awareness, create special outdoor areas for children with autism, and address the shortage of certified arborists in Laredo. This year, the Texas A&M Forestry Service announced a historic $15.4 million in grant funding through its Forestry Grant Program. The goal of the program is to build healthier urban and community forests throughout the state which are essential for the economic, environmental, physical and mental well-being of all Texans. Funding for the program significantly increased from $100,000 in 2022 to $16.65 million in 2023 as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act. ### Hoy, el congresista Henry Cuellar, Ph.D. (TX-28) anunció $3,120,000 en fondos federales para la silvicultura en los patios escolares de Laredo. Los fondos, otorgados por el Servicio Forestal de Texas A&M, fueron posibles gracias a la Ley de Reducción de la Inflación, que el Dr. Cuellar ayudó a aprobar en 2022. “Las comodidades de calidad del campus fomentan un ambiente de aprendizaje positivo para nuestros estudiantes. Los fondos anunciados hoy para el proyecto Adelante con Árboles brindarán una solución forestal urbana única para los estudiantes de Laredo a medida que aprenden más sobre las maravillas naturales de nuestro mundo,” dijo el Dr. Cuellar. “Aplaudo al Servicio Forestal de Texas A&M por utilizar dólares federales disponibles a través de la Ley de Reducción de la Inflación para invertir en el sur de Texas. Gracias a la Dra. Sylvia Guerra Ríos, Superintendente de LISD, y a Tricia Cortez, directora ejecutiva de RGISC, por trabajar conmigo para asegurar estos fondos para los estudiantes de Laredo.” “Más allá de embellecer nuestras escuelas, estos árboles desempeñarán un papel importante para hacer que nuestros campus se sientan más acogedores y atractivos,” afirmó la Superintendente de Escuelas de LISD, Dra. Sylvia G. Ríos. “Nuestros estudiantes verán crecer estos árboles y los conectarán con los gratos recuerdos de su experiencia educativa en LISD.” “Más importante aún, estos árboles también servirán como herramientas útiles para enseñar a nuestros estudiantes sobre el mundo que los rodea y la importancia y la responsabilidad que todos compartimos en el cuidado de nuestro medio ambiente,” exclamó Dr. Ríos. “Estamos muy agradecidos de recibir una subvención tan generosa y, como tal, estamos comprometidos a trabajar junto con nuestros socios comunitarios para impactar positivamente el mundo en el que vivimos,” reiteró Dr. Ríos. “Este es un día especial para tal anuncio; no sólo se llevará a cabo en el Día de la Tierra, sino que representa un nuevo paso adelante para nuestra ciudad fronteriza del sur de Texas. Este proyecto de Laredo fue uno de los cinco seleccionados en todo Texas y habla del compromiso de nuestra comunidad de aumentar la copa de los árboles nativos en Laredo ISD, brindar oportunidades de aprendizaje al aire libre para los estudiantes y comenzar a abordar el cambio climático y la isla de calor urbano severo en el centro de la ciudad,” dijo Tricia Cortez, directora ejecutiva de RGISC. Este premio ayudará al Distrito Escolar Independiente de Laredo (LISD) y al Centro de Estudios Internacionales Rio Grande (RGISC) a implementar su proyecto Adelante con Árboles para plantar árboles y aumentar la cobertura de copas de árboles en un 30% en ocho escuelas de Laredo: El proyecto brindará a los estudiantes mayores oportunidades de educación al aire libre, creará conciencia ambiental, creará áreas especiales al aire libre para niños con autismo y abordará la escasez de arbolistas certificados en Laredo. Este año, el Servicio Forestal de Texas A&M anunció una histórica donación de $15,4 millones en subvenciones a través de su Programa de Subvenciones Forestales. El objetivo del programa es construir bosques urbanos y comunitarios más saludables en todo el estado, que son esenciales para el bienestar económico, ambiental, físico y mental de todos los tejanos. La financiación del programa aumentó significativamente de $100,000 en 2022 a $16,65 millones en 2023 como resultado de la Ley de Reducción de la Inflación. ###',\n",
       " 'U.S. Congressman Washington, D.C. -\\xa0Congressman Michael C. Burgess, M.D. (R-TX), Chairman of the House Rules Committee, joined the Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee in questioning Secretary Xavier Becerra of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on the Fiscal Year 2025 Department of HHS Budget.\\n\\r\\nChairman Burgess highlighted the Biden Administration\\'s failed attempts of enhancing the wellbeing of Americans and questioned Secretary Becerra on what the Administration is doing to curb health care consolidation, preserve independent practices and small providers, and address high health care costs.\\xa0 Click\\xa0HERE\\xa0for Video. \\nOn the importance of preserving independent practice and addressing provider consolidation:\\n “Would you agree that provider consolidation is a problem that needs to be addressed?,”\\xa0asked Chairman Burgess.\\xa0\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s something we\\'ve had forever, there\\'s no reason why consolidation should mean that there shouldn\\'t be independent practice,\"\\xa0said Secretary Becerra.\\xa0\\n \"I’m glad you feel that way. I think that the presence of independent physicians is an invaluable counterweight to the rise of consolidation in our health care marketplace. What is this Administration doing to help preserve independent practice as an option for physicians and patients?”\\xa0asked Chairman Burgess.\\n \"We continue to work within the industry to make sure that no consolidation is occurring for monopolistic purposes. We work with the Department of Justice on that. We try to keep prices competitive. I would probably agree with you if you were to ask me if removing those independent practitioners is going to lead to higher prices and I would probably tell you it absolutely does,\"\\xa0said Secretary Becerra. \"It\\'s going to lead the worst patient care and\\xa0that\\'s really what we should be concerned about. I mean it\\'s one thing to spend a lot of money, it\\'s another thing to spend a lot of money and not deliver the care that people really need,\"\\xa0said Chairman Burgess.\\n \\xa0 On requesting commitment from the Biden administration to address the current disruptive payment rules, preserve independent practice, reduce health care consolidation, and lower costs for American patients:\\n \"Would you consider modifying the upcoming Physician Fee Schedule so that it does not involve the large budget neutrality adjustment and offers facility physicians stability, in cost contrast to many decades of disruptive payment rules?\"\\xa0asked Chairman Burgess.\\n\\n\"That\\'s a dance we have to engage with together. Congress set the rules, the new budget neutrality rules we have to follow. More than willing to work with you because again, if it doesn\\'t really deal with the reality of what the practitioner on the ground has to face, we all should take a closer look.\"\\xa0said Secretary Becerra.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\"Well\\xa0here\\'s the problem. We need to ensure that this year\\'s physician fee schedule doesn\\'t continue the cycle of large budget neutrality adjustments that drive conversion factors down for providers,\"\\xa0said Chairman Burgess.\\n\\n\"So look, we got a problem. The Affordable\\xa0Care Act to CMMI was also going to save money, it doesn\\'t. Poorly constructed models favoring large health organizations, consistent, disruptive payment rules, driving consolidation. What we just heard this week about the change health care problems driving consolidation.\\xa0It seems intuitively obvious to the casual observer that this Administration prefers larger health care systems and neglect smaller providers. For example, why hasn\\'t this Administration embraced ideas, such as site neutral payment reform to lower costs for the patients and reduced consolidation, something that has been included in President\\'s budget\\'s for over a decade?\"\\xa0asked Chairman Burgess.\\n \"I\\'d be more than willing to discuss with you the ways that we have continued to try to sustain the smaller providers because the smaller providers are typically the ones that are in rural America. They\\'re typically the ones that are in lower income America, and we desperately need to keep them in place. We have promulgated a number of policies that support smaller providers. We want to avoid them being gobbled up by the big guys,\"\\xa0said Secretary Becerra. \"Here\\'s a pro tip. Site neutrality can replace budget neutrality. We can afford this. We have the dollars within the system, we can afford to do this, it is just the will to deliver on that,\"\\xa0said Chairman Burgess.\\xa0\\n\\n\"What is the cost per enrollee in the Affordable Care Act?\"\\xa0asked Chairman Burgess.\\n \"That would depend on the plan that they purchase, what their income level is, what the level of subsidy would be.\"\\xa0said Secretary Becerra. \"You say that the cost of care is basically cost plus to Americans but it\\'s not. Americans are paying this bill, and now they\\'re paying highest interest rates on the money they\\'re having to borrow for what you\\'re giving away,\"\\xa0said Chairman Burgess.\\n\\n\\n\\n ### Get the most up to date news from me on Twitter.',\n",

       " 'Roughly six months after the brutal attacks by the Iranian-backed Hamas terrorists, the world watched as Iran launched its own direct and unprecedented attack on Israel. As our closest ally in the Middle East faces more threats to their very existence, it’s important now more than ever that Congress stands up to authoritarian aggression to support Israel.  While I’m sure words of well wishes for our ally are appreciated, it’s sound and expeditious policy that will make an impact in Israel’s fight to defend itself. That’s why House Republicans acted swiftly this week to bring a slate of bills, including several I cosponsored, to stand with Israel and respond to Iran’s heinous attacks. It’s known that Iran is one of the world’s foremost sponsors of terrorism. Yet, in 2008, the Obama Administration set an unruly precedent of appeasing Iran, which Biden has compounded since he took office.  Most recently, as the Iranian-backed Hamas terrorists were planning their attacks, the Biden Administration waived sanctions to allow $6 billion in Iranian funds to be transferred to banks in Qatar and later reissued a waiver that gave Iran access to more than $10 billion. The Iranian regime is highly skilled in evasion, cutting corners, and blurring lines to hide the true use of these funds, and the Biden Administration is compliant and complicit in these efforts. Any funding given to Iran, even if nominally in a restricted account, frees up funds for them to use on malign activities. Iran is too potent a threat for these waivers to exist any longer, so the House voted to pass a bill I cosponsored, H.R. 5947, to eliminate any waivers and licenses related to Iran that would allow Biden to take such actions again. I will not stand by while the Biden Administration continues to show weakness on the world stage. I will continue working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to advance comprehensive policies to prioritize the security of the U.S. and our allies.',\n",

       " \"Washington, D.C. – Today, Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries spoke on the House Floor against pro-Putin extremists who have obstructed our national security and in support of the urgent bipartisan national security package to stand with our allies and protect the American people. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the legislative package that is before the Congress.\\xa0For months, the national security priorities of the American people have been obstructed by pro-Putin extremists determined to let Russia win. A bipartisan coalition of Democrats and Republicans has risen up to work together and ensure that we are getting the national security legislation important to the American people over the finish line. House Democrats have risen to the occasion. President Joe Biden has risen to the occasion. Traditional conservatives led by Speaker Mike Johnson have risen to the occasion. We have a responsibility, not as Democrats or Republicans but as Americans, to do what is necessary to defend democracy wherever it is at risk in the best interest of the free world.\\xa0That is what this legislation represents. We have a responsibility to push back against tyranny. We have a responsibility to push back against totalitarianism. We have a responsibility to push back against terror. And we have a responsibility to stand with our democratic allies throughout the world. Israel is a democratic ally. Ukraine is a democratic ally. South Korea is a democratic ally. Taiwan is a democratic ally. Japan is a democratic ally.\\xa0We have a responsibility to stand with our democratic allies throughout the world. We also have a responsibility to push back against our adversaries.\\xa0Russia is not our friend. The Chinese Communist Party is not our friend. Iran is not our friend. We have a special relationship that exists between the United States and Israel. It’s a relationship that is anchored in shared values and shared interests. Our commitment to Israel’s security is ironclad. Israel has a right to exist as a Jewish and democratic state and safe haven for the Jewish people, who have faced centuries of persecution throughout the years.\\xa0The events of October 7 make clear that Hamas must be decisively defeated for the good of Israel, for the good of the Palestinian people, for the good of peace in the Middle East, for the good of the free world.\\xa0Hamas must be decisively defeated. At the same time, there are other urgent priorities.\\xa0We must do everything possible to make sure that we are freeing the hostages so they can safely return to their families and do everything possible to surge humanitarian assistance into Gaza so we can help out Palestinian civilians who are in harm’s way through no fault of their own.\\xa0We must surge in food, surge in medicine, surge in humanitarian assistance. That is what this package will help accomplish with more than $9 billion in humanitarian assistance. The events of October 7 and the suffering of Palestinian civilians in a theater of war a heartbreaking.\\xa0 Any person of goodwill should come to the conclusion that we have to find a way to achieve a just and lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinian people. And the only way for that to happen is for us to truly commit to a two-state solution when the moment presents itself with a safe and secure Israel living side by side in peace and prosperity with a demilitarized Palestinian state that provides dignity and self-determination for the Palestinian people. Let us recommit to accomplishing that objective.\\xa0The humanitarian assistance in this legislative package will also allow the United States to be there to support people who are suffering all across the world, including millions in Haiti and millions in the Sudan dealing with famine and starvation in a war-torn environment.\\xa0This legislation, of course, will allow us to stand with our allies in the Indo-Pacific in the face of continued aggression from the Chinese Communist Party\\xa0to make sure that freedom and democracy and these values all across the world will continue to be triumphant. This legislation will allow us to support the bravery and the courage of the Ukrainian people, who, against all odds, continue to stand for what we as Americans believe in. In February of 2022, we were told that Ukraine would likely fall in a week and that Russian troops would be in Kiev in a week. But the bravery, the courage, the resilience of the Ukrainian people in the face of the most powerful military in Europe has proven to be consequential in partnership with American support and that of our NATO allies. But\\xa0the Ukrainian people have taught us something, that in the face of an incredible military apparatus that they were confronting, against all odds, that when a people believe in freedom or liberty or democracy, that can overcome even the mightiest of militaries.\\xa0And so we’ve seen them, despite the prediction that they would fall in a week, inflict more than 300,000 casualties on the Russian military, significant portions of the Russian navy wiped out in the Black Sea, more than half the territory that had initially been seized by the Russian military recaptured by Ukraine against all odds. But\\xa0the pro-Putin obstruction that has stopped this national security legislation from advancing to the floor until this point risks all of the progress that has been made, which is why it’s so essential for us to do what is necessary to stand with the Ukrainian people.

       " 'April 19, 2024  Dear Friend,  This week, the dysfunctional Republican leadership finally produced bills for aid to Israel and Ukraine and scheduled a vote for Saturday. The support for Ukraine is long overdue, and I will vote in favor of it, in addition to aid to Israel and for the civilian population of Gaza. I also met in my Washington office with the President of the University of Tennessee and the Chancellor of Rutgers University-Camden, planned to attend next week’s grand opening of the Orange Mound Library in the former Melrose High School, condemned the current Turkish government for human rights abuses, welcomed the Senate’s quick dismissal of the spurious impeachment charges against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, offered some guidance on President Biden’s most recent effort to reduce student loan debt, and offered a health tip tied to warming temperatures. Keep reading and follow me on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to see what I am doing as it happens.  Expecting to Vote for Aid to Support Israel and Ukraine Meeting with University President and Chancellor Looking Forward to the Grand Opening of the Orange Mound Library Condemning Turkey’s Political Oppression Welcoming Dismissal of Mayorkas Impeachment Hoax Offering Guidance on Student Loan Forgiveness Weekly Health Tip Quote of the Week Expecting to Vote for Aid to Support Israel and Ukraine  The dysfunctional Republican leadership of the House has finally scheduled votes on aid to Israel and to Ukraine for Saturday, and I will vote for both measures. The delay in offering support to Ukraine has resulted in reversals on the battlefield and additional loss of life from both military and civilian populations, so providing this assistance is crucial. The measures will also provide military aid to Israel and humanitarian aid to the starving civilian population of Gaza, as well as assistance to Taiwan. Iran’s shooting 300 drones, rockets and missiles at Israel brought this issue to the fore with the need to replenish Israel’s weapons supply. Depending on the outcome Saturday, Speaker Mike Johnson could be seen as a profile in courage for risking his political career for a noble cause. I commend him for scheduling these votes and will support him if there is a motion, as threatened, to vacate the speakership.  Meeting with University President and Chancellor  Chancellor Tillis, Congressman Cohen and President Boyd On Wednesday, University of Tennessee President Randy Boyd and Rutgers University-Camden Chancellor Antonio Tillis visited my Washington office to discuss their education priorities. With President Boyd, we discussed the Tennessee Lottery I passed as a state Senator that provides so many scholarships to U.T. students and others. With Chancellor Tillis, I commended him on his commitment to attracting talented students from Memphis to his prestigious New Jersey university, particularly the “pipeline” he has created between Rutgers and Hamilton High School.  Condemning Turkey’s Political Oppression  My late Congressional colleague Tom Lantos was a champion of human rights, and I am proud to be a member of the commission created in his name. The Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission held a hearing on Tuesday with expert witnesses on the ongoing oppression in Turkey. Among the hearing witnesses was Enes Kanter Freedom, a human rights activist and former NBA basketball player who was punished by the NBA for expressing his political views about the lack of human rights in China. See my questioning of witnesses here.\\xa0  Looking Forward to Orange Mound Library Grand Opening Next Friday, April 26, I plan to attend the grand opening of the Orange Mound Library at the former Melrose High School for which I secured $3 million in community project funding. The transformation of the school is an inspiring example of what happens when federal funding is invested in our community.  Welcoming Dismissal of Mayorkas Impeachment Hoax  The U.S. Senate made fast work of the meritless impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Wednesday, dismissing both baseless charges in less than three hours. I voted against the impeachment hoax and was pleased to see the Senate toss it aside without debate. Sadly, many in the press wondered if this kind of spectacle means the Senate is becoming like the House – a political, not a policy-based chamber.  Offering Guidance on Student Loan Forgiveness President Biden’s latest action to erase student loan debt is projected to extend relief to more than 30 million Americans. This is benefiting people of all ages — from young people who are new to the job market to moms and dads who have been paying off old loans with sky-high interest rates for years.\\xa0The new plan will cancel runaway interest for millions; it will automatically cancel debt for borrowers who are eligible for programs like SAVE and PSLF but just haven’t applied; it will cancel debt for borrowers who entered repayment decades ago and for people who enrolled in programs with low –financial value programs; and it will provide debt relief for people who are experiencing serious financial hardship. The Biden Administration has already helped four million people save $146 billion on student loan debt, and this is another big step in the right direction.\\xa0  Weekly Health Tip  Besides the cicadas we anticipate seeing as temperatures rise, the heat also brings mosquito season to our region.

       " \"502 Cannon HOB, Washington, DC 20515Email Me(202) 225-6435 On April 13, Israel endured an unprecedented attack of more than 300 long-range missiles and drones from Iran. The Islamic Republic of Iran has been a sworn enemy of Israel since the 1979 Iranian revolution and is the primary state sponsor of terrorist groups such as Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthi movement in Yemen. However, Iranian forces had never launched a direct barrage against Israel from its own territory prior to last week. Miraculously, 99 percent of the projectiles were intercepted by Israel’s Iron Dome and David’s Sling defense systems and a coalition including American, British, French, Jordanian, and Saudi forces. This demonstrated the vital need for such defense systems and the hard-won success of U.S.-led cooperation with regional partners to promote security. It’s an understatement to say Israel is in a dangerous neighborhood; Iran and its proxies have sworn to eliminate the state. Without the historic Abraham Accords negotiated by the Trump administration in 2020 and the subsequent intelligence coordination with Arab countries, thwarting Iran’s bombardment to such a degree may not have been possible. In the face of Iran's attack, our ally Israel deserves our full support. Tensions between the two Middle East nations have run high for decades, and the sheer scale of Iran’s attack is a blatant escalation which must be met with solidarity and strength. This week, the House considered a resolution I cosponsored condemning this attack and affirming Israel’s right to self-defense. It passed by a vote of 404-14. I am also a cosponsor of the No U.S. Financing for Iran Act (H.R.5921) and the Standing Against Houthi Aggression Act (H.R.6046). Both passed the House this week with my support. The Biden administration has made the mistakes of relaxing economic sanctions on Iran and weakening terrorist designations for the Houthis who have been committing acts of terror in the Red Sea, disrupting one of the world’s busiest shipping routes, since the October 7 attacks by Hamas. While President Biden sought to make $6 billion available to Iran in an August 2023 appeasement deal, H.R. 5921 would increase financial pressure on the government of Iran. H.R. 6046 would fully reinstate Houthi terrorist designations removed by the administration in 2021. Since the devastating and tragic October 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas, the terrorist group continues to hold hostages, including American citizens. Very troublingly, it cannot account for the number of hostages they once were thought to have. Hamas must ensure the safe release of all hostages. Israel certainly has the right to respond to the attacks they have suffered, and they are still responding. It is important for us to stand behind Israel and our friends around the world who seek to do the right thing. Israel will need to replenish critical munitions and its defense systems following the onslaught by Iran. We should likewise do what we can to share the resources they need to stand for the cause of freedom. ###\",\n",
       " 'April 20, 2024 WASHINGTON\\xa0– Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) issued the following statement on her votes today on the House’s votes on foreign military aid packages for Israel, Ukraine..\\xa0 Yesterday, Rep. Pressley filed a pair of amendments to increase funding to global humanitarian assistance and place a one-year moratorium on the transfer of offensive weapons to the Israeli military. The amendments were not adopted in the final legislation.\\xa0 “In this moment of growing global conflict, I have consistently advocated for policies and budgets that save lives, promote de-escalation, and work toward peace across the globe. “It is unconscionable that Congress would consider sending more offensive weapons and funding to the Israeli military, which for months has operated with callous disregard for human life in Gaza and perpetrated significant human rights violations. Over 34,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces, millions of civilians in Gaza are on the brink of famine, and over 100 hostages are still held captive by Hamas. While I support Israel’s right to defend itself—especially following the horrific October 7th attack and I grieve deeply for those impacted—we cannot bomb our way to peace and become complicit as the Netaynahu government continues to massacre the Palestinian people. I voted NO on H.R. 8034 and continue to call for the United States to facilitate a lasting, bilateral ceasefire to save lives, return all hostages, deliver meaningful humanitarian aid to Gaza, and negotiate a long-term diplomatic solution that results in a just and lasting peace for Israelis and Palestinians alike.” “I also believe Congress should provide long-overdue assistance to help the Ukrainian people defend themselves against Vladimir Putin’s unjust and illegal invasion. This conflict has claimed the lives of tens of thousands of innocent people and displaced millions of others, and my heart breaks for the Ukrainian and Russian civilians who have had to deal with this unspeakable trauma. While I never take a vote on military aid lightly and believe diplomacy and humanitarian aid should be the priority, we have an obligation to stop Putin’s unjust invasion. I voted YES on H.R. 8035. “I am encouraged that Democrats were able to secure some global humanitarian aid in these bills, which will help mitigate these worsening crises. However, I am deeply disappointed that the Republican majority did not consider my amendment to drastically surge humanitarian aid to address the crises in Gaza and Ukraine, as well as in Haiti, Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan, and others. We must continue to prioritize global humanitarian assistance, including restoring critical funding for UNWRA. “As a parent, woman of faith, and caregiver, I pray that we can build a world where all of our children can thrive and know peace, whether they’re in Massachusetts, Gaza, Ukraine, Israel, or Haiti.”\\xa0 Since the horrific October 7th attack, Congresswoman Pressley has consistently and stridently called for a ceasefire to save lives, return all hostages, and surge humanitarian aid to Gaza. This week, Rep. Pressley\\xa0delivered a floor speech\\xa0in which she called or urgent de-escalation in the Middle East and renewed her calls for a ceasefire in Gaza to prevent a broader regional war. As Co-Chair of the House Haiti Caucus, Rep. Pressley has also led calls for\\xa0extending Temporary Protected Status\\xa0for Haiti, a\\xa0halt to deportations, a Haitian-led democratic transition, the\\xa0delivery of humanitarian, economic and security assistance\\xa0to the island, and more. Throughout the Israel and Hamas conflict, Rep. Pressley has been a vocal and consistent advocate of diplomacy, de-escalation, and saving lives. ### Washington DC Office 402 Cannon HOB\\r\\nWashington, DC 20515 Phone (202) 225-5111\\r\\nFax (202) 225-9322 District Office 1295 River Street\\r\\nHyde Park, MA 02136 Phone (617) 850-0040\\r\\nFax (202) 225-9322',\n",

Today is, in many ways, Congress’ first official vote where we can weigh in on the direction of this war.\\xa0If Congress votes to continue to supply offensive military aid, we make ourselves complicit in this tragedy.\\xa0 “Our votes against H.R. 8034 are votes against supplying more offensive weapons that could result in more killings of civilians in Rafah and elsewhere. We believe strongly in Israel’s right to self-defense and have joined colleagues previously in affirming our shared commitment. “All of us support strengthening the Iron Dome and other defense systems and we are committed to a sovereign, safe, and secure future for Israel. To protect that future, we believe the United States must help achieve a ceasefire that allows hostages to be freed, humanitarian aid to be delivered, and peace talks to begin. “Benjamin Netanyahu appears willing to sacrifice the hostages while inflicting extraordinary suffering on the people of Gaza. He is willing to expand this conflict to preserve his power at the expense of Israel’s safety. In recent weeks, reports have indicated that Netanyahu is moving closer to a full-scale invasion of the southern Gaza town of Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians have taken shelter. When faced with the question of whether to provide offensive aid to further this conflict, we believe there is a moral imperative to find another path. “Most Americans do not want our government to write a blank check to further Prime Minister Netanyahu’s war in Gaza. The United States needs to help Israel find a path to win the peace.”\\xa0 ###\\xa0 \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIssues: Foreign Affairs & National Security  \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWashington, DC Office\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t2346 Rayburn House Office Building\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWashington.

Kathy Castor (FL-14) released the below statement on House passage of the bipartisan  national security package: “Democracy and freedom won today as a bipartisan majority – 210 Democrats and 101 Republicans – voted to provide emergency security and humanitarian aid to Ukraine. Despite months of delay at the hands of MAGA Republicans, I’m confident that America and our allies will be better equipped to stand strong and united against authoritarians like Vladimir Putin. “The security package provides support for the people of Ukraine and Israel while also providing much-needed humanitarian assistance to civilians affected by conflicts – including millions of Palestinians who continue to face an urgent humanitarian crisis as water and food supplies dwindle. “This package will help Israel defend itself from Hamas and Iran by replenishing the Iron Dome missile defense system that has protected the people of Israel and was pivotal in minimizing the impact of Iran’s recent attack. “The package also provides crucial resources for U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), headquartered at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, and the operations in the Middle East area of responsibility so that our military can respond to attacks on American interests by Iranian proxies. “Strategic investments in the Indo-Pacific will deter aggression from China and help maintain peace and stability throughout the region.\\xa0 “I am thankful Speaker Johnson finally scheduled the vote, but the harm inflicted on civilians, our allies, our global standing and our national security at the hands of MAGA Republicans’ delay tactics will not be forgotten.

       " 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Representative Virginia Foxx (R-NC) issued the following statement after the House passed the National Security Supplemental that provides resources for Israel, the Indo-Pacific, Ukraine, as well as additional measures to counter foreign aggression in each region: “By allowing for a transparent and constructive process, the People’s House has created a stronger outcome of fulfilling our obligations to our allies in their time of need. The first step in quashing the possibility of a foreign war is enacting impactful deterrence measures. Without question, this is an axis versus allies moment, and deterrence is the optimal way to stop Iran, China, North Korea, and Russia in their tracks. If we were to have accepted the Senate’s blank check for foreign aid without reservation, this process would have never yielded a strong, ironclad product.  “That said, I was proud to support separate amendments during this process, specifically relating to Ukraine, with the sole intention of keeping aid targeted and narrow in scope. These amendments involved eliminating all non-military funding to Ukraine as well as to block an increase in the President’s drawdown authority and foreign military financing. Europe must also step up to the plate and ensure that Ukraine remains on a direct path to self-reliance so that this caliber of assistance is not necessary in the future. In the end, there remained a clear imperative of providing necessary assistance – and we rose to meet the moment.”',\n",
       " 'Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H. R. 4639, the Fourth Amendment Is Not For Sale Act.  As Ranking Member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, my priority is our national security and to protect Americans from foreign threats. Our Intelligence Community agencies at times purchase what is known as “commercially available information” from data brokerage companies to gather information on foreign spies and bad actors, and to protect America from malign foreign influence. When they purchase this data, they cannot be certain that it is entirely free of any U.S. citizen’s information. In order to protect citizens, agencies are already required to take steps to ensure that this incidentally obtained data is removed.  However, these data brokerage companies collect the personal information of Americans through their social media profiles, public records, and other commercial sources. They then sell this information to companies, organizations, or any entity with an interest in collecting data on American citizens – including foreign adversaries like China, Russia, or even cartels. H.R. 4639 would do nothing to keep any of these other entities from exploiting and sharing American’s data.   Instead of prohibiting our own intelligence agencies from accessing commercially available information to obtain foreign intelligence, we must take steps to address the broader vulnerability of Americans’ data. Congress needs to take steps to protect Americans, not undermine our Intelligence agencies and put the United States at a deep disadvantage against our adversaries.  Thank you, and I yield back.

       " 'FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE April 16, 2024 Congressman Trone Calls for Increased Funding for Job Training and Health Care, Improved Outcomes for the Bureau of Prisons in Hearing with AG Garland Congressman David Trone questions Attorney General Garland during the Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations Subcommittee hearing.\\xa0 WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Congressman David Trone (D-MD) questioned Attorney General Garland during a Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations Subcommittee hearing. During the hearing, Trone asked questions about the Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) staffing shortages, ID cards, telemedicine, solitary confinement, de-escalation training, clean slate laws, and the antitrust division.\\xa0 CONGRESSMAN DAVID TRONE:\\xa0Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Cartwright, and thank you, Attorney General Garland for appearing here today, and thank you for your patience as you deal with this committee.\\xa0 I’m a co-chair of the Bipartisan Second Chance Task Force, and we’re concerned about staffing shortages at the BOP. The BOP is funded at 93%.\\xa0 But we’re only staffed at 86%. What’s happening is education, wraparound services for mental health, etc, which could improve our outcomes, job training, get left behind. So we’re all in agreement on that. We’d like to figure out how to implement the bipartisan First Step Act successfully. And to do that, we’ve got to have the staffing. Could you talk a minute about what this does to lead to lousy outcomes? Where we can’t cut our prison budget because we don’t give folks a second chance to win and succeed.\\xa0\\xa0 ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND:\\xa0I do think that the money we have to provide more incentives for people to stay on the job in the Bureau of Prisons means that the chances of reducing recidivism will increase.\\xa0 CONGRESSMAN DAVID TRONE:\\xa0That sounds like a smart investment to me. Second quick question, 75 percent of BOP inmates do not have a photo ID when they leave prison. They can’t secure housing, apply for jobs, open a bank account, federal benefit programs, etc. The Bureau is addressing this by providing IDs to U. S. citizens now. We have a bipartisan bill, the\\xa0BOP Release Card Act,\\xa0that supports this effort at the BOP by ensuring new IDs fulfill all the requirements and directs BOP to work with the states to have a one-on-one exchange so we can work right with the states to move these folks into getting their new ID card and then successfully be able to exchange that for state ID cards. So we would appreciate your help in moving this bill forward. Does that make sense to you? ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND:\\xa0Yeah, we would be happy to give technical assistance. I think we may, our staff may have already, our staffs may have already consulted on this, but of course, we’d be happy to give technical assistance. The BOP has implemented its own release ID program in October of 2023 and they’re on track for implementation by this spring. CONGRESSMAN DAVID TRONE:\\xa0Excellent. Thank you. The DEA has extended current telemedicine flexibilities for prescribing controlled medications through December 31, ‘24.\\xa0 But, there’s not a revised proposed rule and many patients are at risk of losing access to prescriptions needed for mental health and substance use disorder. Last year, my colleagues and I expressed concerns about the proposed DEA rule that would have limited patient access to buprenorphine and encourage an evidence-based approach to make permanent the use of audio-only or audio-visual telehealth technology for buprenorphine prescribing. This is crucial to reach these patient populations, including unhoused, rural, and tribal. So as a follow-up to that letter, we introduced the TREATS Act, which allows medication for opioid use disorder to be prescribed via telemedicine. What’s DOJ’s position on the continued use of telehealth flexibilities to ensure access to these medically necessary substance use disorder treatments? And how is this supported in your budget request?\\xa0 ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND:\\xa0So as you noted the DEA and HHS have extended the current telemedicine flexibilities until December 31st of this year. DEA has issued a proposed rule, which would allow authorized providers to prescribe medicines for opioid use disorder via telemedicine.\\xa0 They are working to promulgate a final year by the — I’m sorry a final rule — by the fall of this year.\\xa0\\xa0 CONGRESSMAN DAVID TRONE:\\xa0Okay, excellent. Thank you very much. Just quickly, restrictive housing, otherwise known as solitary confinement, outdated, inhumane practice often used way too far too often. We believe the BOP has been dragging its feet in reforming this area of restrictive housing. In the past 10 years, DOJ has conducted studies and task forces to improve restrictive housing, yet we fail to make any progress. What steps can DOJ and BOP take together so we can make this more effective and improve restrictive housing policies?\\xa0 ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND:\\xa0Well, the new BOP director is very much committed to what you’re talking about. BOP recently published a proposed rule on discipline designed to reduce the use of restrictive housing for disciplinary segregation. BOP is trying to hire more psychologists and provide de-escalation training which would help reduce the need for restrictive housing.\\xa0 CONGRESSMAN DAVID TRONE:\\xa0Excellent. Thank you very much. I yield back.\\xa0\\xa0 SECOND ROUND OF QUESTIONING CONGRESSMAN DAVID TRONE:\\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Last year we helped pass the bipartisan Law Enforcement De-escalation Training Act, which provides 124 million in grant funding over four years for de-escalation training for police officers. This is going to save lives, improve police-community relations. Although this program is new, could you talk briefly about its implementation and more broadly how DOJ’s budget prioritizes mental health and crisis stabilization?\\xa0 ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND:\\xa0Yeah, I don’t have the specifics with respect to that program, but as a general matter, our COPS office and our Office of Justice Programs provide de-escalation, money for de-escalation training, it is an important way to protect the lives of officers and first respondents as well as the people who are calling for help. You are also right in the implication of your questions that many of these calls involve people who are mentally ill or have a mental impairment, and that the sensitivity of respondents to that possibility is an important element of the need for de-escalation.\\xa0\\xa0 CONGRESSMAN DAVID TRONE:\\xa0Thank you for your efforts there. 70 to 100 million Americans have criminal records that appear on routine background checks, often preventing them from getting jobs. Over the last seven years, my company has hired about 1,400 returning citizens, which is good for business and cuts down recidivism. Automatic clearing records are costly and have been a barrier to widespread adoption. What resources does the DOJ need to help support these clean slate laws?\\xa0\\xa0 ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND:\\xa0Well, I don’t think I’m, I’m gonna be able to, to talk to you specifically about the Clean Slate laws you know, in the area of criminal justice reform in the implementation of the Second Chance Act, which involves reentry programs, we’re asking for $125 million for those reentry programs. In addition, there is a new program called the Accelerating Justice System Reform Grants, which is a $300 million request for FY25 and $15 billion over 10 years. I’m not sure exactly whether the clean slate would fall within those, but I’ll ask my staff to get back to you on which of the grant programs go to the program here. CONGRESSMAN DAVID TRONE:\\xa0Yeah, we’d love to keep working with you. Last quick question to build on represent — Ranking Member DeLauro on the antitrust division. Should this committee take another look at the language that eliminates — stops you from having full access to the merger filing fees and locks you into that $233 million?\\xa0 ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND:\\xa0Well, I’m gonna leave it to the Members of Congress to resolve this question. The Justice Department is in favor of the antitrust division getting full access to the fees. But you know, in the end, the Congress makes those determinations.\\xa0 CONGRESSMAN DAVID TRONE:\\xa0Seems like a good idea. Thank you.\\xa0 ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND:\\xa0It does seem like a good idea.

       " 'FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE April 19, 2024 Trone, Cárdenas Lead Introduction of Resolution Declaring April 2024 as Second Chance Month WASHINGTON, D.C.– Today, U.S. Representatives David Trone (D-MD-6), Tony Cárdenas (D-CA-29), Bruce Westerman (R-AR-4) and Don Bacon (R-NE-2) alongside U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Kevin Cramer (R-ND) reintroduced the bicameral Second Chance Month Resolution. The bicameral, bipartisan effort to designate April 2024 as Second Chance Month serves as reminder of the significant legal and societal barriers for the thousands returning from incarceration each year. In a nation that was founded on new possibilities, this resolution affirms that those who are returning home from jail or prison should have access to rehabilitation, redemption, and the chance to contribute positively to their communities. “Second Chance Month is an opportunity to recognize the importance of providing justice-impacted individuals with a real second chance at rebuilding their lives,”\\xa0said Congressman David Trone, cofounder, and co-chair of the Second Chance Task Force. “After decades of overcriminalization, our country must make progress toward putting compassion over confinement. This month — and every month — we recommit ourselves to delivering on this promise.” \\xa0“Having witnessed firsthand the injustices that countless individuals in my community have faced upon reentry, I’ve made it a priority throughout my years as an elected official to advocate for the resources to make second chances possible,”\\xa0said Congressman Tony Cárdenas. “In America every person deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, and we must continue to do everything in our power to ensure that people who were formerly incarcerated have access to reentry services and opportunities for a better tomorrow.” “Second Chance Month is an important platform to raise awareness of the challenges that formerly incarcerated individuals, who have paid their debt to society, experience in re-entering their communities,”\\xa0said Congressman Bruce Westerman. “Opportunity after incarceration is critical to breaking the cycle of crime and reducing recidivism. I’m proud to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in this effort to acknowledge that second chances are paramount in fostering safer communities.” “Sadly, many formerly incarcerated individuals return to the prison system because they haven’t been given the opportunity to benefit from rehabilitation, given a chance at a job or training, and have faced scorn from their fellow man,”\\xa0said Congressman Don Bacon. “The Second Chance Month Resolution highlights the need to focus on opening doors for those who are reentering society, instead of slamming them shut.” “We praise the Senate and House sponsors of the Second Chance Month resolution, which echoes the values shared by Prison Fellowship and the more than 800 churches and partners who believe that Americans with a criminal record can rise from their past, make amends, and reach their God-given potential,”\\xa0said Heather Rice-Minus, CEO and President of Prison Fellowship. “We support the passing of this resolution and the lawmakers who strive to remove unfair and unnecessary barriers to work, housing, education, and other fundamentals for citizens who have paid their debt to society so they can live lives of productivity and purpose.” Congressman David Trone was elected to the House of Representatives in November 2018 to serve the 6th District of Maryland, which includes all or part of Montgomery, Frederick, Washington, Allegany, and Garrett Counties.

The legislation would require the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) to notify U.S. Immigration and Customs enforcement (ICE) and relevant local law enforcement when an illegal alien tries to purchase a gun. “Those who come into America illegally should be detained and deported. They certainly shouldn’t be able to purchase a firearm.

It is already against the law for an illegal immigrant to purchase a firearm, and this legislation would notify the appropriate authorities when an illegal immigrant tries to break the law,” said Senator Tillis. “Our local law enforcement and immigration officials should have the tools to know if folks are in our country illegally. Instead of taking every opportunity to crack down on lawful FFLs just trying to earn a living, the Biden administration should capitalize on their dutiful work by using their resources to prevent unlawful actions by illegal immigrants.

Across the country, autopsies are often delayed for months on end, preventing families from gaining important closure and hurting our ability to fight future health crises,” said Murphy. “Our bill tackles this problem head-on by providing funding, training, and support to attract qualified medical graduates to forensic pathology so that we have enough Board-Certified Forensic Pathologists to meet national demand.” “The current shortage of medical examiners puts public safety and public health at risk,” said Cornyn. “The U.S. must increase the current amount of forensic medical service providers to meet the needs of communities across the country, and this legislation would help medical providers recruit and train qualified individuals to enter the critically important field of forensic pathology.”“I am proud to join my colleagues in leading this important legislation that could help grow the medical examiner and forensic pathology workforce in Mississippi and across the country,” said Guest. “I look forward to continuing to work with Representative Cleaver, who is my fellow co-chair of the House Forensic Science Caucus, and Senators Cornyn and Murphy on this critical initiative.”“Medical Examiners play a pivotal role in both public health and safety nationwide, but far too many communities are facing a dangerous shortfall of experienced examiners, with the United States needing to roughly double the number of board-certified forensic pathologists to meet the nation’s current needs,” said Cleaver. “To ensure local law enforcement and public health officials have the information they need in a timely manner, it is imperative that Congress strengthen the pipeline of quality pathologists. I’m proud to join Senators Cornyn and Murphy, along with Rep. Guest, to introduce bipartisan legislation that will address this emergency.” Medical examiners and coroners are a crucial part of America’s public health system and help identify causes of death, monitor evolving health challenges, and save lives. Staff shortages can delay autopsies and death certification for months, preventing families from gaining closure and hamstringing the medical community’s ability to fight the opioid epidemic and other health crises. Currently, there are only about 800 full-time practicing forensic pathologists in the country, but the U.S. needs 1,500-1,800 to provide full national coverage.

       " 'WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) co-authored an op-ed in the Bulwark with Ian Marcus Corbin, a philosopher at Harvard Medical School and a Senior Fellow at the think tank Capita, arguing that former President Trump and the Republican party fixate on immigration and border security to preserve their convenient diagnosis for why so many Americans feel abandoned by their country. Murphy and Corbin expose the dishonesty of Republicans’ argument – exemplified by their tanking of a serious bipartisan border deal – and explain that in reality, our obsession with individual success and blind faith in neoliberal economics have created the angst many Americans feel. They argue that leaders should focus on rebuilding American solidarity and a culture that prioritizes the common good. \\xa0 “The country would be better off if we had been able to pass the bipartisan border bill—and not only because it would have strengthened our border security,” the authors wrote. “It would also have left the Trumpian narrative in tatters. Without tens of thousands of immigrants streaming into the country, Republicans would be forced to deal with the complicated reality of why Americans feel more alone and unhappy than ever before. Because it turns out that impoverished people making a desperate play for a better life are not the true source of our angst, and so even if the border were brought under control, our spiritual crisis would have remained.” \\xa0 Murphy and Corbin highlighted how the policies of neoliberalism are most responsible for the way people are feeling, highlighting a recent trip they took to Appalachia: “We heard the same point over and over: People here feel abandoned. Locals told us how good, dignified jobs had left the region, gone in search of cheaper forms of labor, and how pharmaceutical companies had added to the suffering by aggressively plowing addictive, life-wrecking opioids into the region. Many people we spoke with had been directly affected by these problems, and everyone knew of someone who had been affected. Meanwhile, important community institutions, like hospitals and mom-and-pop stores, have withered. Local business owners told us they feel constantly in danger of being squashed by monopolistic corporate behemoths. And ever present in the background was the sense that the government had failed to prevent any of it.” The authors argued that America’s myth of self-sufficiency has eroded our commitment to the common good: “In the last forty years, our sense of obligation to each other has eroded as wealth and personal success have been lionized at the expense of temperance and the common good. Today the sense that each of us is rightly responsible to fend for ourselves in the world sits uncomfortably with an older, deeper sense that we shouldn’t have to face exploitation, deprivation, humiliation, or loneliness. Americans want to stand on their own two feet, but we need to know that there are some limits to competition and greed, and that those around us will defend us, befriend us, or pick us up when we stumble, which we all do.” Murphy and Corbin concluded: “It falls to us to rebuild a sense of obligation to each other—a new American solidarity. We will need to build concrete policies that prevent excesses and cruelties now permitted in the name of profit. But we will also need to rebuild a culture that prioritizes the common good—the idea that we owe more to each other than just whatever the market will allow us to get away with. The threads that connect us have frayed or been cut. Our work, in this election year and beyond, is more than just shaming the demagogues; we must repair our badly damaged tapestry of common concern.” Read the full op-ed here. ###',\n",
       " 'HARTFORD— U.S. Senators Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) on Friday applauded Senate passage of a resolution they introduced honoring the late U.S. Senator Joseph Lieberman. “Few people left a bigger mark on this world than Joe Lieberman. The history books will remember him for his work to combat climate change, fight for gay rights, and protect the homeland, along with his groundbreaking role as the first Jewish nominee for national office. But I will remember most working with him day in and day out to bring federal dollars back to Connecticut and fighting for policies that made our state stronger. Joe refused to be defined by his party, he led with decency and character, and he conveyed an unbridled enthusiasm for public service. He was one of one, and Connecticut was lucky to have him,” said Murphy. “Joe Lieberman was a monumental figure in Connecticut and national politics and I will always remember him for his unwavering values and willingness to bridge divides. He was ferociously independent and deeply strong willed, but also eager to listen, understand and learn from others. Joe’s story ended too soon, but his legacy is large and lasting,” said Blumenthal.\\xa0\\xa0 Lieberman was born in Stamford, Connecticut in 1942 and graduated from Yale University in 1964 and Yale Law School in 1967. Lieberman was elected Attorney General of the State of Connecticut in 1982, where he led efforts to set higher standards of legal assistance to state agencies and implement a focus on constituent services that continues to this day. During his tenure as Attorney General, Lieberman fought to expand and enforce consumer and environmental protections—efforts he continued to build on once elected to the United States Senate in 1988. Lieberman served as U.S. Senator for Connecticut from 1988 to 2012 and played a key role in creating the Department of Homeland Security and establishing the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States following September 11, 2001. While serving in the Senate, Lieberman was a strong advocate for civil rights and led efforts to repeal the “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” policy of the U.S. Armed Forces. He also led passage of the Clean Air Act of 1990, promoted legislation to warn consumers about the dangers of pesticides and was an early supporter of efforts to combat climate change. In 2000, Lieberman made history as the first Jewish major party nominee for the position of Vice President as Al Gore’s running mate. After leaving public office, Lieberman continued his work in national security and civil rights through organizations such as the Muslim-Jewish Advisory Council and the Counter Extremism Project. The resolution was introduced and passed the Senate on April 18, 2024. Text of the Senate resolution can be found HERE. ###',\n",

The resolution commends the Huskies’ dominant performance and defeat of every opponent by at least 13 points on their way to their sixth national title since 1999, a feat no other college team has surpassed. This is the Huskies’ second consecutive championship, becoming only one of eight NCAA Division I men’s basketball teams to accomplish this achievement. They also recognize Tristen Newton for being named the Most Outstanding Player of the tournament and congratulate UConn fans, students, and faculty for the incredible accomplishment. \"I\\'m a diehard UConn fan, but even I was in awe at the season long domination of this team. Coach Hurley\\'s uncanny ability to blend transfers, veterans, and freshman was a sight to behold, and I was so fired up to be on hand for the final three games of their historic NCAA tournament run. This team will go down in history as possibly the greatest of all of UConn men’s teams, and the whole state is deeply proud of how they represented Connecticut throughout the year,” said Murphy. “The Huskies have filled the great state of Connecticut with pride once again following their record-breaking, consecutive victory,” said Blumenthal. “I congratulate the players’ and coaches’ on earning UConn’s sixth national championship, reasserting Storrs as the ‘Basketball Capital of the World.’ This win is a result of their hard work, dedication, and perseverance. I stand in unwavering support of the team and program.” The resolution was introduced in the Senate on April 19, 2024. ###',\n",
       " 'Hiring and paying formerly incarcerated people living wages helps build a diverse, robust, and resilient workforce; reduces recidivism\\xa0 Resolution Text (PDF) Washington (April 16, 2024) - Senators Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) today introduced a resolution declaring April as Fair Chance Jobs Month to ensure that formerly incarcerated people have a chance at securing good-paying, stable employment. The Fair Chance Jobs Month Resolution expands upon the Biden administration’s 2021 declaration of April as Second Chance Month, focusing on policies to expand job opportunities for formerly incarcerated people.\\xa0 In the United States – which has among the highest recidivism rates in the world – nearly 14,000 laws and regulations and regulations, along with 48,000 other collateral consequences, restrict formerly incarcerated people from getting the professional licenses necessary to secure some jobs. Nearly two-thirds of formerly incarcerated people remain jobless; those who have served their sentence and have been released continue to face systemic biases and stigmas that make finding a job extremely difficult. For those who land a job, their earnings are nearly $100 less per week than the average worker.\\xa0 There are also numerous economic benefits to fair chance hiring. For example, employers can leverage financial incentives, such as the federal work opportunity tax credit, to create job opportunities for formerly incarcerated people.\\xa0 “The patterns of our criminal legal systems continue to repeat themselves, where people are put behind bars over and over again without fair access to opportunities, resources, and support,” said Senator Markey. “Formerly incarcerated people should be given a fair chance to land a good-paying job so they can support a better life for themselves and for their families, as well as help strengthen the workforce with their unique qualifications. Our resolution is a positive step forward towards ensuring that formerly incarcerated people receive the recognition, respect, and dignity they deserve.” “As a former prosecutor, I have seen firsthand the employment challenges people can face when they are released after serving their sentence,” said Senator Klobuchar. “This resolution to recognize Fair Chance Jobs Month will raise awareness of the barriers formerly incarcerated people face in the job market and promote opportunities for those who are looking to reenter the workforce.” A copy of the resolution can be found HERE.\\xa0 Cosponsors of the resolution in the Senate include Senators Laphonza Butler (D-Calif.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Peter Welch (D-Vt). The resolution is endorsed by JustLeadershipUSA. “We want to thank Sen. Markey and Sen. Klobuchar for putting forward this resolution and taking into consideration both our lived experience and our subject matter expertise in the process. Because April is recognized as ‘Second Chance Month’ for those who are directly impacted by the criminal legal system, it is already an important month at JustLeadershipUSA. The Senators’ proposal to have a fair chance at employment makes April that much more significant to the directly impacted community. This resolution recognizes the immense harm done by the criminal legal system to those directly impacted — particularly in the economic sector. It also sheds light on several pervasive carve-outs to basic human needs that continue to impact families and communities. There is an inextricable link between health equity and economic justice. We must continue to dismantle racist and unjust systems, significantly increase access to funding for training and social supports and center the voices of people who are directly impacted,” said DeAnna Hoskins, President and CEO of JustLeadershipUSA.\\xa0 In February 2024, Senator Markey sent a letter to Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm urging the Department of Energy (DOE) to make good-paying clean energy jobs accessible to currently and formerly incarcerated people.\\xa0 In December of 2023, Senator Markey also led colleagues in introducing the End Solitary Confinement Act, legislation that would end solitary confinement in federal prisons, jails, and detention centers, with limited exceptions. ###',\n",
       " 'Washington (April 16, 2024) – Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) released the following statement after the U.S. House of Representatives transmitted to the U.S. Senate the articles of impeachment for Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. “This impeachment process is a partisan sham meant to show fealty to Donald Trump. Abuse of the impeachment process erodes public trust, which is already at historic lows in our institutions and government due to Donald Trump’s lies and MAGA misinformation. The House impeachment articles against Secretary Mayorkas make faulty allegations citing to overturned statutes and reversed cases. Their claims lack the substantial evidence necessary to show a plausible violation of law.  “Republicans are more interested in creating political drama with this impeachment than policy solutions for the immigration system.\\xa0Republicans have shown time and again that they are unwilling to come to the table to negotiate policies to give people coming to this country for a better life fairness and dignity. They would rather criminalize immigration and run on it as a campaign slogan than reform our broken system comprehensively. Impeachment is not a tool to settle policy disagreements. “We must create meaningful pathways to settlement and citizenship, full and fair processing of protection claims, safeguards for DREAMers, and meaningful federal support for communities where new arrivals settle. I will continue to advocate for solutions that center humanity and hope and prioritize dignity and determination for all who seek a better life.”  ###',\n",
       " '“MPT and MIP have played a key role in this steep financial decline and must play a role in the recovery of these hospitals in order to preserve and protect access to care for communities in Massachusetts.” Text of Letter (PDF) Boston, MA – United States Senators Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) sent a letter to Edward K. Aldag, Jr., Chairman and CEO of Medical Properties Trust (MPT) and Karl Kuchel, CEO of Macquarie Infrastructure Partners (MIP), pushing them to play a role in stabilizing Steward Health Care in Massachusetts. MPT and MIP share ownership of Steward’s Massachusetts hospitals’ real estate, and have been collecting huge lease payments from Steward on property the company used to own. This is a key reason that Steward’s Massachusetts hospitals have huge debts that have driven the company to the financial brink. “Steward’s Massachusetts hospitals are in deep financial distress and appear to be in danger of closure because of years of mismanagement, private equity schemes, and executive profiteering,” wrote the senators. “MPT and MIP have played a key role in this steep financial decline and must play a role in the recovery of these hospitals in order to preserve and protect access to care for communities in Massachusetts.” MPT has been enmeshed with Steward since 2016, when Steward’s then-owner, private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management (Cerberus), made a $1.25 billion sale-leaseback deal with MPT. In doing so, Cerberus saddled Steward’s Massachusetts hospitals with long-term leases and millions of dollars in rent payments. MPT has also loaned hundreds of millions of dollars to Steward, which were then used to pay the rents owed to MPT – further driving up the hospitals’ debt.. MIP became involved with Steward in September 2021, when the company bought a 50% stake in MPT’s ownership of Steward’s Massachusetts properties. “(T)hese investments have all the appearances of a Ponzi scheme that is continuing to harm Steward-owned hospitals: MPT continued to provide capital to Steward, which allowed the hospital system to continue paying rent to MPT,” the senators wrote. “This allowed MPT to avoid devaluing its real estate purchases and the leases that it held, bolster its stock price, and report lucrative cash flows.” However, by 2023, Steward ran up a $50 million shortfall. According to MPT’s October 2023 financial report, Steward’s Massachusetts hospitals owed cash rent of nearly $60 million annually on leases that run until 2041 and include “escalator” clauses indexed to inflation. This debt, as well as the high rents these hospitals continue to pay, are a massive barrier to providing quality care to these communities. “MPT has – along with Steward – plundered these hospitals,” wrote the senators. “While we seek answers to these questions about MPT’s past behavior and MIP’s involvement in Steward’s financial problems, your companies also have an important opportunity to help Steward’s Massachusetts hospitals overcome this crisis by offering long-term reductions in lease payments or early termination of leases to make it financially feasible for new operators to take over these hospitals.” To address the senators’ concerns, they are requesting MPT and MIP answer questions on their involvement with Steward by April 22, 2024. ###',\n",

Markey (D-Mass.), member of Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, and Senator Bill Cassidy (R-La.) today announced new cosponsors and organizational support for their bipartisan, bicameral Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA 2.0).\\xa0 Along with Senators Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas), the Chair and Ranking Member of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, who cosponsored COPPA 2.0 in February, the following senators are new cosponsors of the legislation: Senators Richard Blumenthal\\xa0(D-Conn.), Laphonza Butler (D-Calif.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.V.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Angus King (I-Maine), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), Joe Manchin (D-W.V.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.). “With COPPA 2.0 introduced in the House and new cosponsors in the Senate, momentum is quickly building for our critical legislation to protect children and teens’ online privacy,” said Senators Markey and Cassidy. “We must put an end to the pervasive online tracking and targeting of our young people. We thank our colleagues for the support of COPPA 2.0 and are committed to enacting these essential protections into law.” “Big Tech companies treat children like ATMs, monetizing their every move online. I’m proud to join COPPA 2.0 as a cosponsor to protect the privacy of kids online,” said Senator Blumenthal. “I am deeply concerned by the way our children are tracked online,” said Senator Butler. “If we cannot rely on Big Tech companies to make good on their commitment to prioritize children’s privacy over profits, we need to legislate them into action and make crystal clear the urgent need for reform.” “All individuals, including children, are the rightful owners of their personal information.\\xa0They should be granted a certain set of privacy rights and the ability to protect those rights.\\xa0This legislation safeguards the data of America’s kids and prevents targeted ads, protecting our children as they navigate an increasingly digital world,” said Senator Crapo. “As the online environment evolves, it’s critical that we update how we protect our children from consuming online content that could be detrimental to their development and safety,” said Senator King. “The bipartisan, bicameral Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act will ensure that our children are guarded from pervasive tracking and targeting, often used by companies or bad actors looking to manipulate our young family members. Maine has a strong tradition of supporting digital literacy and learning, and this bill will act as a backstop for the online safety of our children.” “Despite the dangers our kids are exposed to online, it’s been more than 25 years since Congress passed any legislation regulating the internet,” said Senator Klobuchar. “This critical legislation will bring much-needed updates to our data privacy laws, empowering parents and young people to control how their data is collected and used.” “I’m proud to join my colleagues in supporting this legislation that updates the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act to better protect our teens and kids online,” said Senator Luján. “Our country has a responsibility to put them in a position for success. That’s why I’m supporting this bipartisan solution that better protects youth by preventing harmful data collection practices while holding tech companies accountable.” “The bipartisan, bicameral Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act is crucial to protecting the safety of our young people online,” said Senator Manchin. “We must protect our country’s youth from the dangers of social media and invasive data collection and I’m pleased that support for the bill is growing. I will continue working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to advance this important, commonsense legislation to keep our children and teens safe on the internet.” “There are commonsense steps that we can take to keep kids and teenagers safe on social media and the internet. This bill is one of them,” said Senator Peters. “I’m proud to help lead this bipartisan, bicameral effort to ensure parents can rest assured knowing their kids’ personal data is private and protected online.” “Social media companies are making billions of dollars every year from ads targeted at teens in the United States. So it’s no wonder why they have no appetite to change their business model on their own. It’s working for them – just not for the millions of young kids who are sad and lonely and angry because of it. These kids need help. And because the companies have shown time and again that they won’t step up, Congress must instead,” said Senator Schatz. “Our children’s lives are increasingly integrated with the internet, from completing homework to connecting with friends. As our kids and grandkids spend more time online, ensuring they are protected from harm is a shared priority—whether you’re in a red state or blue state. This bill will enact crucial protections to help safeguard children and teens’ online privacy,” said Senator Welch. “I\\'ve said for years that forcing companies to protect the privacy of kids, teens, and all Americans is the single best thing Congress can do to make the internet safer and more trustworthy.\\xa0For this reason, I strongly support Senator Markey’s COPPA 2.0.\\xa0It\\'s beyond time that we limited the data companies can collect on teens. This is the best way to curb companies\\' ability to target minors with ads and harmful content,\" said Senator Wyden. \\xa0 New organizations supporting COPPA 2.0 include the AASA, The School Superintendents Association, American Federation of Teachers, Association of Educational Service Agencies, Association of School Business Officials International (ASBO), Consortium for School Networking, Council of the Great City Schools, National Association for Pupil Transportation, National Education Association, National Rural Education Association, National School Boards Association, Public Interest Privacy Center, and Public Knowledge. “AASA is proud to support COPPA 2.0. We commend Senators Markey and Cassidy for their tireless work on the Children and Teens’\\xa0Online Privacy Protection Act, and are pleased to see today’s legislation balance two critical priorities: supporting the incorporation of education technology into education to promote learning and success for students and ensuring student data privacy. We look forward to continuing to work with Congress to ensure COPPA 2.0 maintains its enhanced privacy protections for children and teens online, and that these protections do not have unintended consequences for our nation’s schools,” said Dr. David R. Schuler, Executive Director of AASA, The School Superintendents Association. “The Public Interest Privacy Center (PIPC) is proud to support the updated version of COPPA 2.0 and its codification of long-standing administrative policy allowing schools to consent to educational technology uses. COPPA 2.0 finds the right balance between protecting child and teen privacy online while allowing schools to provide appropriate, technology-enhanced educational opportunities to all students,” said Amelia Vance, President of Public Interest Privacy Center. “We are proud to support COPPA 2.0, which will allow educators and schools to harness the full potential and benefits of educational technologies while protecting children and teens online,” said Marc Egan, Director of Government Relations at the National Education Association. “Public school educators want what parents want for their kids—that they can thrive in safe and supported schools and communities. Sadly, we are in the middle of an unprecedented mental health crisis among our nation’s youth, exacerbated by the failure of social media companies to protect consumers, particularly young people, from bullying and disinformation. The lack of protections leads to challenges including learning disruptions, increased anxiety and depression. In America, we adopt regulations and laws to protect children from dangers, as we did with addressing lead paint or requiring seatbelts, and we must do that here. COPPA 2.0 would provide the solutions parents, educators, healthcare workers, and our children and teens need by modernizing and strengthening\\xa0our privacy laws to reflect the online world they live in now. Sen. Ed Markey’s bill would stop Big Tech’s predatory data practices by banning the collection of young users’ personal information without their consent and prohibiting targeted advertising to children and teens that tracks and traumatizes them. It also creates an ‘eraser button’ so a child’s decisions don’t follow them for the rest of their life,” said Randi Weingarten, AFT President. Last week, Representative Kathy Castor (FL-14), and Representative Tim Walberg (MI-05) introduced the House companion to COPPA 2.0. In July 2023, the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee unanimously passed COPPA 2.0. ###',\n",

Markey (D-Mass.), chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Clean Air, Climate, and Nuclear Safety today led a letter with Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) to World Bank President Ajay Banga urging the World Bank to stop fossil fuel financing and increase climate investment, a step Senator Markey and his colleagues initially called for last February. The letter also asks the World Bank to increase transparency in financing decisions and to engage meaningfully with developing countries in all activities relevant to loss and damage, which is temporarily housed in the World Bank. As the 2024 World Bank Spring Meetings begin, the World Bank still has not publicly committed to ending fossil fuel financing, which risks further fueling the climate crisis and reducing available capacity for the Bank to support developing countries’ clean development and adaptation efforts. In their letter to the World Bank, the members wrote, “While the World Bank committed to align its financial flows with the goals of the Paris Agreement in its Climate Change Action Plan 2021-2025, the Bank provided an average of $1.2 billion annually between 2020 and 2022 in direct fossil fuel finance. Although direct financing for fossil fuels has decreased over time, the Bank continues to provide indirect financing for fossil fuel projects through financial intermediaries, as well as technical assistance, policy-based operations, and trade finance.” The lawmakers continued, “The Bank’s direct and indirect support for fossil fuel projects supercharges the climate crisis while decreasing lending capacity, leverage capital, and availability of climate financing for developing countries. The Bank must provide more transparency in fossil-fuel-project financing decision-making, including making its process public, in order for there to be needed accountability.” In February 2023, Senator Markey led a letter to the World Bank’s former president David Malpass and its Board of Directors asking for new leadership that will take climate action, end fossil fuel financing, and better support low-income countries through grants and other financial mechanisms. In December 2023, Senator Markey wrote a follow up letter urging the Biden administration to meet its Glasgow Statement pledge to end all international public financing of unabated fossil fuel projects and provide public plan for how to meet this goal. ###',\n",

This letter is the latest in the Senators’ ongoing efforts to push auto manufacturers and regulating agencies to take seriously the dangers of partially automated and automated driving systems. These driving systems, which are becoming increasingly common, present a long list of safety concerns at a time when roadway deaths are already too high.

       " 'During the BP oil spill in 2010, Markey raised questions about the potential toxicity of Corexit Letter Text (PDF) Washington (April 18, 2024) - Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), chair of the Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Clean Air, Climate, and Nuclear Safety, today sent a letter to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Michael Regan asking the agency to address concerns related to its recently revised regulations governing chemical dispersant use in oil spill responses. The letter was sent ahead of the 14th anniversary of BP’s Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010. The revised regulations, which follow a letter sent by Senator Markey and colleagues to the EPA in July 2022, take steps to support the use of more effective and safe dispersants, but fail to prohibit or discourage the use of Corexit, a toxic dispersant used in oil responses, including the Deepwater Horizon clean-up. According to a 2012 study in the journal Environmental Pollution, “when oil and Corexit are combined, the mixture becomes up to 52 times more toxic than oil alone.” Additionally, the revisions are unclear as to whether a federal official serving as an On-Scene Coordinator can overrule a local- and state-level Area Committee responsible for oil spill response that does not want to use toxic dispersants in its community. In the letter to Administrator Michael Regan, Senator Markey wrote, “The EPA’s new final rule allows the continued use of toxic, known-carcinogen oil dispersants, placing the health and safety of oil spill responders and the public at risk. As the EPA interprets and implements its new rule, I urge it to take immediate proactive measures to ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, the regulations protect the environment and prioritize worker and public health.” Senator Markey requested answers to the following questions by May 8, 2024: ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Why is the EPA allowing the use of toxic and known carcinogenic dispersants Corexit 9500A and Corexit 9527A until December 2025? ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Is the EPA planning to initiate a delisting process for Corexit 9500A and Corexit 9527A? If so, when? If not, why not? ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Has the EPA requested disposal plans for existing stockpiles of all toxic dispersants? If not, why not? ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What authority do Area Committees have in relation to On-Site Coordinators to prevent the usage of toxic oil dispersants in local waters? ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What immediate precautions can the EPA recommend to the National Response Team and Regional Response Teams to protect worker and public health during oil spills? Senator Markey was the leading Congressional investigator into BP’s Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and forced BP to post online the “Spillcam” of the underwater spill. In 2010, as then-Chair of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment, Senator Markey led a bipartisan Congressional delegation to the Gulf of Mexico to assess the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and its impact on the waters, beaches, and marshes of four coastal states, and to meet with affected communities and response teams. In May 2010, then-Rep. Markey queried the EPA on the dangers of applying oil-dispersing chemicals deep underwater as an effort to mitigate the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, including the potential toxicity of the trademarked formulation, called Corexit. Also during the spill, then-Rep Markey queried the Food and Drug Administration for information on how Gulf of Mexico seafood that could be purchased and eaten by humans would be monitored for potential long-term exposure to chemicals, in light of use of chemical oil dispersants by BP. Fifty-two days after the start of the disaster, Senator Markey chaired the first Congressional hearing on Deepwater Horizon to investigate the cause and damage of the spill. ###',\n",
       " 'Rule would reclassify broadband as a telecommunications service and reinstate net neutrality protections Washington (April 18, 2024) - Senators Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), along with Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel, Senator Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), and Representative Anna Eshoo (CA-16), today at a press conference praised the upcoming FCC rule reclassifying broadband as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Communications Act and reinstating net neutrality protections. The FCC officially released the rule on April 4, and the Commission will vote on the final rule at its open meeting on April 25.\\xa0 Net neutrality is essential for all Americans to be able to freely communicate, seek jobs and telehealth care, run businesses, and more. The Trump administration had previously repealed the net neutrality rule, stripping away the protections of a free and open internet and eliminating the Commission’s rightful authority over broadband.\\xa0\\xa0 “Over six years after the Trump FCC foolishly repealed the net neutrality rule, the FCC is on the verge of reinstating these critical protections and regaining the authority to oversee the most critical communication tool of our day: broadband,” said Senators Markey and Wyden. “This rulemaking is an overdue recognition that broadband – like water or electricity – is essential, and the FCC’s authority should reflect that. We commend Chairwoman Rosenworcel and the Commission staff for their hard work, diligence, and expertise, and we will continue to work with them to adopt and defend strong net neutrality protections.”\\xa0 “Americans should be able to use the internet without fear and without foreign adversaries posing legitimate threats to them on U.S. soil. We need to protect the growing innovation economy by making sure that we have rules that say you can’t throttle, you can’t slow down, and you can’t charge exorbitant fees just to have preferential treatment,” said Senator Cantwell. “I applaud the Chair for their work and look forward to working with her. I thank my colleagues, Senator Markey, who has been such a leader on this, and my dear friend, Anna Eshoo, for her unbelievable leadership in the House.”\\xa0 “I’ve advocated for a free and open internet since I came to Congress. Lack of an open internet has real life consequences. In 2018, while Santa Clara County firefighters were fighting one of the largest wildfires in California’s history, Verizon throttled their data speeds, slowing them down to one 200th of their normal speed, severely hindering their ability to communicate and putting people’s lives at risk. The FCC’s action to restore net neutrality is imperative for public safety, consumer protection, and American innovation,” said Congresswoman Eshoo. “There are a lot of things in this country that divide us, but net neutrality is not one of them. Survey after survey showed that 80 percent of the public support the FCC’s national net neutrality rules and opposed their repeal.\\xa0 Bringing back the FCC’s authority over broadband and putting back net neutrality rules is popular, and it has been court-tested and court-approved. It is good for consumers who count on broadband like never before, and it is important for public safety and national security. When the FCC votes next week, we have an opportunity to get this right. Because in a modern digital economy, it is time to have broadband oversight, national net neutrality rules and policies that ensure the internet is fast, open, and fair,” said Chairwoman Rosenworcel.\\xa0 In 2006, Senators Markey and Wyden introduced the first net neutrality bills in the House of Representatives and Senate, respectively. On April 2, Senators Markey and Wyden, along with Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), sent a letter to the FCC urging it to finalize a strong net neutrality rule. In September 2023, Senators Markey and Wyden led 25 of their Senate colleagues calling on the FCC to reclassify broadband as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Communications Act and restore net neutrality protections. Senators Markey and Wyden previously introduced the Net Neutrality and Broadband Justice Act, which would accurately classify broadband as a telecommunications service under Title II.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 ###',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) released the following statement after Senator Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) moved to quickly reject the articles of impeachment against DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas without holding a Senate trial.\\xa0 “Today is a sad day in the history of the U.S. Senate as Leader Schumer and Democrats desperately attempt to sweep Biden’s border catastrophe under the rug,” said Senator Blackburn. “Our current Secretary of Homeland Security refuses to do his primary job: secure the homeland. Under his leadership, over 9.4 million immigrants have been welcomed to ILLEGALLY enter our country, including potential terrorists and dangerous criminals who have harmed American citizens. Thousands of migrant children have been used, abused, and recycled by cartels. It is unfathomable that we would allow this to occur in the United States.” “If this partisan coverup were happening in the GOP, there would be uproar on every front page in America. Rejecting the impeachment articles against Secretary Mayorkas – without allowing Senators and the people they represent to hear the evidence – is an unprecedented disservice to the American public.”',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON, DC -- Today, in a letter to the Senate artificial intelligence (AI) working group leaders, U.S. Senators Mitt Romney (R-UT), Jack Reed (D-RI), Jerry Moran (R-KS), and Angus King (I-ME) unveiled the first congressional framework to deal exclusively with the extreme risks posed by future developments in advanced AI models. The senators’ framework would establish federal oversight of frontier model hardware, development, and deployment to mitigate AI-enabled extreme risks from biological, chemical, cyber, and nuclear threats. As Congress considers how to approach new technology developments, the senators’ framework aims to prioritize the national security implications of AI while ensuring our domestic AI industry is able to develop and maintain an advantage over foreign adversaries. This framework is limited to frontier models—the most advanced AI models that are still yet to be developed. “AI has the potential to dramatically improve and transform our way of life, but it also comes with enormous risks to national security and our humanity at large,” Senator Romney said. “My colleagues and I have spent the last several months developing a framework which would create safeguards and provide oversight of frontier AI models aimed at preventing foreign adversaries and bad actors from misusing advanced AI to cause widespread harm. It is my hope that our proposal will serve as a starting point for discussion on what actions Congress should take on AI—without hampering American innovation.” “Artificial intelligence models are being adopted at a rapid pace. While AI has massive potential to benefit society, we must recognize AI’s security threats and ethical issues to ensure it’s adopted in a manner that recognizes and mitigates these risks. This bipartisan framework addresses key catastrophic challenges posed by AI and the security protocols needed to safeguard against them. We can’t wait to act. Responsible oversight must keep pace with technology and responsibly support innovation, opportunity, and discovery,” said Senator Reed.\\xa0 “The evolution of artificial intelligence is an opportunity for U.S. innovation, efficiency and strategic advantage,” said Senator Moran. “However, we must responsibly harness the power of AI and make certain we are mitigating extreme risks that would threaten our national security. My colleagues and I developed this proposal to begin the discussion regarding how the U.S. can mitigate national security risks in a manner that ensures innovators are still able to secure a competitive edge over our adversaries in this critical technology area.” “In the ever-evolving global threat landscape, the United States has to stay one step ahead of new technologies to protect both our national security and interests at home and abroad – and that means moving carefully, warily, and thoughtfully into an Artificial Intelligence future,” said Senator King. “This AI framework provides critical guidelines for federal oversight of AI technology so that it cannot be misused by bad actors looking to cause harm. We must ask important questions now to wisely navigate our next steps and decisions. Thanks to my colleagues for working together on a solution that promotes American development while safeguarding the public against biological, chemical, cyber, and nuclear threats.” \\xa0 Background:  Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to dramatically improve and transform our way of life, but also presents a spectrum of risks that could be harmful to the American public, some of which could have catastrophic effects. Extremely powerful frontier AI could be misused by foreign adversaries, terrorists, and less sophisticated bad actors to cause widespread harm and threaten U.S. national security. Experts from across the U.S. government, industry, and academia believe that advanced AI could one day enable or assist in the development of biological, chemical, cyber, or nuclear weapons. While Congress considers how to approach new technology developments, we must prioritize AI’s potential national security implications. New laws or regulations should protect America’s competitive edge and avoid discouraging innovation and discovery. The Romney, Reed, Moran, King framework would establish federal oversight of frontier AI hardware, development, and deployment to mitigate AI-enabled extreme risks—requiring the most advanced model developers to guard against biological, chemical, cyber, or nuclear risks. An agency or federal coordinating body would oversee implementation of new safeguards, which would apply to only the very largest and most advanced models. Such safeguards would be reevaluated on a recurring basis to anticipate evolving threat landscapes and technology.

       " 'WASHINGTON, DC – The U.S. Senate is expected to deal with the articles of impeachment against U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas this week and U.S. Senator Jack Reed (D-RI) says the Senate should act on a bipartisan basis and swiftly vote to dispose these meritless charges due to the complete lack of evidence and the fact that such a precedent would increase further rancor in Congress. House Republicans failed to impeach Secretary Mayorkas in their first attempt on February 6th. \\xa0Sensing they had only hours before Democrats picked up another seat in the special election to replace disgraced former-Representative George Santos (R-NY), GOP leaders jammed the vote through on its second attempt by a vote of 214-213 on February 13th.\\xa0 The Cuban-born son of a Cuban father and Romanian mother – whose family fled the Holocaust – Alejandro Mayorkas and his family came to the U.S. in 1960 as refugees.\\xa0 He previously served as a U.S. attorney, as the Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and as the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security.\\xa0 His nomination to lead DHS was endorsed by former DHS secretaries Tom Ridge and Michael Chertoff, who both served at DHS under George W. Bush. Once the House transmits the articles of impeachment to the Senate, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) indicated that the Senate will consider them in accordance with Senate rules. \\xa0In all impeachment trials, except for the President or Vice President, the Senate’s President Pro Tempore, currently Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), presides, and all other senators take an oath as jurors.\\xa0 When the Senate is in session as a court of impeachment, it must set aside all other legislative business.\\xa0 Two-thirds of the Senate must vote to convict, but a simple majority could vote to dispose of the case.\\xa0 This would be the first impeachment trial of a Cabinet member since 1876. Senator Reed is backing a swift, bipartisan rejection of these charges. “This unjustified impeachment is a partisan hit-job and an abuse of Congress’s Constitutional powers. \\xa0The way it was carried out demeans the entire institution.\\xa0 The Senate should reject these trumped-up articles of impeachment on a bipartisan basis and protect the standard of true high crimes and misdemeanors,” said Senator Reed.\\xa0 “House Republicans waited nearly two months after voting to impeach Secretary Mayorkas to seek a trial in the Senate.\\xa0 And during that time they actively blocked bipartisan border security fixes.” The unprecedented and unjustified impeachment of Secretary Mayorkas has been widely denounced across the political spectrum. Recently departed-Representative Ken Buck (R-CO), who was one of a handful of House Republicans to vote against impeachment, stated: “I prosecuted for 25 years. I know what a high crime and misdemeanor are and I know that this doesn’t qualify. … This is a terrible impeachment. It sets a terrible precedent. … We’ve got to stop this in this body, or we are going to lose our credibility with the– further lose our credibility with the American public.” Former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, who served in the cabinet of George W. Bush put it bluntly: “I can say with confidence that, for all the investigating that the House Committee on Homeland Security has done, they have failed to put forth evidence that meets the bar.”\\xa0 Chertoff’s op-ed noted: “Despite our different parties, I know Mr. Mayorkas to be fair and honest — dedicated to the safety and security of the U.S. He has represented DHS to the country and to both parties in Congress with integrity.” Additionally, over the last few months several Senate Republicans have cast serious doubt on the House Republican impeachment charade.\\xa0 Several Senate Republicans have spoken out against the misuse of ‘snap impeachments’ or declared the Mayorkas vote a ‘waste of time.’ Notable comments by Senate Republicans include: Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) called Mayorkas’ impeachment “the worst, dumbest exercise and use of time.” Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) stated that House Republicans were “targeting a member of the administration without doing their homework to find precisely why he should be impeached.” Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) declared Mayorkas impeachment by House Republicans “a detour from the important work that’s going on.” Senator Jerry Moran (R-KS) said in January that impeachment “is never the answer just to disagreements on policy.” Senator James Lankford (R-OK), who negotiated the bipartisan border security bill told reporters that he expects Mayorkas’ impeachment will fail in the Senate: “If I could use the House term, it’ll be dead on arrival when it comes over.”',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON, DC – In an effort to crack down on money laundering, illicit finance, and fraud in the U.S. financial system, U.S. Senator Jack Reed (D-RI) led a group of seven U.S. Senators in supporting the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network’s (FinCEN) proposed rule to require investment advisers to abide by anti-money laundering (AML) rules similar to what banks do.\\xa0 This week, Reed, along with U.S. Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Mark Warner (D-VA), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen urging regulators to apply anti-money laundering rules to most investment advisers and require them to flag suspected money laundering activities. In their letter, the senators say that Treasury’s proposal would help crack down on money derived from foreign corruption, fraud, and tax evasion entering the United States through unregulated private funds. This includes money from Russian oligarchs and Chinese Communist Party sovereign wealth funds and military companies.\\xa0 Treasury’s proposal would strengthen oversight of investment advisers, who collectively manage tens of trillions of dollars, but until now, have been largely exempt from the AML regulations. Text of the letter follows: April 15, 2024 Secretary Janet Yellen U.S. Department of the Treasury  1500 Pennsylvania Ave. NW  Washington, DC 20552 Re: Financial Crimes Enforcement Network: Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism Program and Suspicious Activity Report Filing Requirements for Registered Investment Advisers and Exempt Reporting Advisers (Docket No. FINCEN-2024-0006; RIN 1506-AB58). Dear Secretary Yellen: We write in support of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network’s (FinCEN’s) proposed rule to include investment advisers in the definition of “financial institution” in the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), which would require them to maintain anti-money laundering (AML) programs, report suspicious activity to the government, file currency transaction reports, and keep records related to the transmittal of funds (the Proposal). The Proposal would help regulators crack down on money laundering and sanctions evasion. It would also protect our Nation’s financial system from abuse by sophisticated criminals, oligarchs, and our adversaries and strategic competitors. We wrote to you in March 2022 asking FinCEN to extend the AML framework to advisers, and we are pleased that the Proposal is consistent with our request. We therefore urge FinCEN to finalize the Proposal as quickly as practicable. While most investment advisers serve customers on Main Street and comply with the law, segments of the industry, in particular advisers to private funds, have been attractive to money launderers and sanctioned persons. One reason is that advisers are exempt from requirements to maintain AML programs, verify the identities of their customers, and report suspicious transactions to FinCEN. While other financial intermediaries, including banks, brokers, and insurance companies, are already subject to the basic requirements in the Proposal, coverage of advisers is uneven. For example, advisers affiliated with a broker or a bank generally fall under an enterprise-wide AML program. In other circumstances, an adviser may voluntarily implement AML measures. But the lack of standardized requirements has allowed bad actors to seek out an adviser that will turn a blind eye to the ultimate source of the money they are managing. Treasury has tried to plug these regulatory gaps through proposals in 2002, 2003, and 2015. Unfortunately, those rules were never finalized due to strong opposition from Wall Street, the private equity lobby, and the hedge fund lobby. In the meantime, more economic activity is being conducted through asset managers. Since the 2015 proposal, assets under management with registered advisers has ballooned from approximately $60 trillion to $130 trillion. Around $20 trillion of that is attributable to private funds. National security risks posed by this regulatory gap have grown since 2015. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) recently indicated with “high confidence” that “threat actors likely use private placement of funds, including investments offered by hedge funds and private equity firms, to launder money, circumventing traditional AML programs.” Similarly, the United States Strategy on Countering Corruption notes that the lack of AML coverage “may allow corrupt actors to invest their ill-gotten gains in the U.S. financial system through hedge funds, trusts, private equity funds, and other advisory services or vehicles offered by investment advisers that focus on high-value customers.” The Treasury Department also found that investment advisers “have served as an entry point into the U.S. market for illicit proceeds associated with foreign corruption, fraud, and tax evasion” in large part due to the “lack of comprehensive AML/CFT regulation.” Private funds have many other attributes that make them vulnerable to money laundering, including a wealthy investor base with a penchant for secrecy, the use of sprawling structures that include shell companies around the world, aggressive strategies to avoid taxation, limited public reporting obligations, and light-touch principles-based regulations. Indeed, you recently testified before the Senate Banking Committee that “it appears that some of those advisers who aren’t subject to [AML] regulations are taking the money of Russians or Chinese [persons] and moving it through hedge funds and essentially washing it here in the United States .... And we have identified instances where investment advisers have worked with sanctioned individuals, corrupt officials, tax evaders, and criminals.” We strongly endorse Treasury’s current efforts to finish the job it started in 2002. According to a top Treasury official, Russian oligarchs are exploiting “vulnerabilities in our AML system that may result from inadequate regulatory treatment” for private funds. Treasury has identified more than 80 advisers in the United States that sponsored private funds in which Russian oligarchs have invested and 20 of those advisers had “significant ties” to these oligarch investors. A recent Treasury risk assessment found that some advisers “manage billions of dollars ultimately controlled by sanctioned entities, including Russian oligarchs and their associates who help facilitate Russia’s illegal and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine.” Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, who was sanctioned by the United States in 2023, hired an adviser in New York in 1999 to manage and grow his fortune to over $7 billion, primarily through investments in over 100 different U.S.-based hedge funds and private equity funds. We understand that several of these funds had voluntarily implemented AML programs or relied on the programs of their affiliated brokers. But those programs were not effective because they were not comprehensive, were not regularly examined for compliance, and did not result in the adviser confirming the ultimate identity and sources of funds of a major investor—in this case, “a Russian oligarch who has long and close ties to Vladimir Putin” and who has “been benefitting from Russian decision-makers responsible for the annexation of Crimea or the destabilization of Ukraine.” In addition, these private equity funds presumably had long lock-up periods that prevented Mr. Abramovich from liquidating his investments for several years. The illiquid nature of private funds appeared to be a feature, not a bug, for Mr. Abramovich, whose goal was to stash wealth derived from his corruption and kleptocracy and safely grow it in U.S. markets over a period of decades. He had no intention or need to realize any investment gains until long after any initial lock-up period expired. This is just one example of how illiquid funds have become an attractive target for money laundering on a massive scale. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has also exploited the opaque nature of private funds to sidestep restrictions on direct foreign investment and fly under the radar of regulators. Chinese sovereign wealth funds have cultivated ever closer ties to U.S. private equity funds to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in highly sensitive industries, including the defense sector, with long-term effects on our national security. According to the FBI Director, the Chinese government actively conceals its ownership or control of private funds and steals sensitive technology, such as AI and quantum computing, that China can use to gain a military edge. As investors in private funds, CCP-funded entities have new avenues to conduct espionage because they are able to request special access to details about portfolio company business and operations, under the guise of monitoring investment performance. The government will continue to lack basic oversight about these flows of information and funds unless the Proposal is finalized. The Proposal would allow the government to protect the financial system from these alarming trends and limit illicit financial activity in the United States. It would require advisers to have policies, procedures, and internal controls designed to prevent the adviser from being used for money laundering or terrorist financing and to comply with the BSA. It would help ensure accountability by designating an AML compliance officer at each adviser. It would also establish minimum requirements for customer due diligence. Together, these requirements would prevent money from criminals and sanctioned persons from flowing through the cracks to advisers that do not have meaningful AML obligations. The Proposal would also hand powerful examination and enforcement tools to the government to ensure compliance and extract significant civil and criminal penalties for violations. For example, Mr. Abramovich’s U.S.-based investment adviser was sued in September 2023 by the Securities and Exchange Commission only for ministerial violations of the securities laws (i.e., failure to register under the Advisers Act), and not for violations of the underlying AML laws, which carry much stiffer penalties. Had the Proposal been finalized, the government would have additional tools to bring civil and criminal cases under the BSA for this misconduct. These requirements are especially important for advisers to private funds, which have pushed into just about every single industry in the United States ranging from healthcare to financial services to defense. They have grown beyond their roots in conducting leveraged buyouts or investing in public markets and now conduct all kinds of other financial activities, such as private credit or direct lending, that historically has been conducted by the regulated banking sector that has been subject to the BSA since its inception. The Proposal sensibly updates the AML rules to keep pace with the size, scope, complexity, and importance of the asset management industry. Advisers conduct similar activities to banks, brokers, and insurance companies. Therefore, they should be subject to similar AML obligations. Requiring advisers to establish AML programs, report suspicious activity, and file currency transaction reports, among other requirements, would go a long way towards deterring Russian oligarchs, CCP-linked companies, and other illicit actors from using private funds to enter the U.S. financial system. Following Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the United States has worked with its allies and partners to find the assets of sanctioned Russian oligarchs. But as the United States has been imposing unprecedented sanctions against Russia, sanctioned oligarchs are increasingly looking for places to stash their money outside the government’s reach. Emily Kilcrease, a Senior Fellow at the Center for a New American Security, testified before the Senate Banking Committee, that the Proposal could help Ukraine by closing “evasion routes and loopholes to make sure that when [the United States] imposes these sorts of sanctions, they’re really biting the way we want them to.” We agree that closing loopholes and vulnerabilities in our financial reporting laws through the Proposal will make it easier for federal investigators to identify where oligarchs and other criminal actors are placing their assets. In the Proposal, FinCEN stated its intention to apply customer identification and due diligence requirements to advisers in the future, and we encourage FinCEN to do so. Identifying and verifying the identity of investors, including beneficial ownership information, is foundational to any AML and sanctions screening program. For example, it is not possible for a firm to screen a potential customer against sanctions lists without this information. Strong CIP and CDD requirements are particularly important for the opaque private markets. Indeed, private funds currently enjoy special treatment allowing them to conceal information about their investors. For example, the Corporate Transparency Act exempts pooled investment vehicles from reporting beneficial ownership information to FinCEN. This loophole hamstrings FinCEN’s efforts to crack down on the use of private funds to facilitate illicit financial flows. Further, the securities laws limit the circumstances in which the SEC can obtain information about the “identity, investments, or affairs of any” private fund. In short, there is currently no public disclosure or regulatory reporting of beneficial ownership information for private funds under the securities laws, national security laws, or state corporate law—making it all the more important for advisers to collect, verify, and screen against this information. In order to guard against AML and other national security risks, FinCEN should quickly move forward with additional rulemaking to subject advisers to similar CIP and CDD requirements as those applicable to brokers and dealers. FinCEN is required to revise the final rule entitled “Customer Due Diligence Requirements for Financial Institutions” by January 1, 2025, and that rulemaking is a logical vehicle to address this issue for advisers. The Proposal would extend AML obligations to a segment of advisers called exempt reporting advisers (ERAs), which are advisers solely to private funds with less than $150 million under management in the United States or solely to venture capital funds. There are approximately 6,000 ERAs with at least $6 trillion under management. Many of these ERAs are foreign advisers that manage billions of dollars for U.S. investors, but use creative tactics and complex structures to qualify for the exemption. It is critical for these advisers and these assets to be brought under the BSA framework. This aspect of the Proposal should be finalized as proposed. Although ERAs are not required to register with the SEC, they remain subject to many of the same obligations as registered advisers. These include public disclosure of information regarding the private funds that they sponsor, regulatory reporting of systemic risk information, a fiduciary duty to clients, restrictions on conflicted practices like principal trades and cross transactions, rules against committing fraud on investors in private funds, requirements to have insider trading policies, and restrictions on political contributions to state and local officials. AML obligations bear a very close resemblance to items on this list. If ERAs are already required to maintain insider trading policies in order to prevent fraud on our financial markets, then they should also be required to maintain AML policies in order to prevent the financial system from being abused by criminals and sanctioned persons. The baseline set of rules and prohibitions that apply to ERAs are designed to root out egregious misconduct that can cause a loss of confidence in our markets and financial system. AML program requirements fall squarely within this category. Investment advisers have an important role to play in safeguarding the U.S. financial system from crime. They can be valuable partners for FinCEN as it seeks to meet our enormous challenges to combat not only money laundering, but also fraud and other financial crimes. Such a partnership is also important to ensure the effectiveness of U.S. sanctions programs, which have expanded significantly during the pendency of FinCEN’s rulemaking. Accordingly, it is important to our national security that rigorous AML and sanctions compliance standards finally are extended to investment advisers. For these reasons, we respectfully request that you move as quickly as practicable to finalize the Proposal. Thank you for your consideration of these comments. Sincerely, Reed, a senior member of the Banking Committee, has strongly backed Treasury’s proposal.\\xa0 When it was first released in February, Reed stated: “I commend Secretary Yellen for aggressively going after dirty money and cracking down on money laundering and sanctions evasion.\\xa0 This new rule is a win for U.S. national security and a blow for kleptocrats, tax cheats, and criminals who have previously gotten away with exploiting the U.S. financial system.\\xa0 Treasury’s proposal would close a loophole that allows drug traffickers, Putin’s cronies, and CCP-linked entities access to the U.S. financial system.\\xa0 They use this access to enrich themselves, commit crimes, and make the world less safe for Americans.\\xa0 This new rule, which is long overdue, will close the loophole and combat money laundering and sanctions evasion.\\xa0 It will help stop the bad guys from hiding their wealth.” In March of 2022, Reed led a letter to the Treasury Department urging the agency to revise and reissue proposed rules from 2015 that would have imposed anti-money laundering and suspicious activity report filing requirements on investment advisers, including advisers to private equity funds and hedge funds.',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, and Jack Reed (D-RI), a senior member of the Senate Banking and Housing Committee, are pushing the nation’s four largest banks to protect consumers from costly and damaging wire fraud. In a letter to the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citi, the Senators press the banks to provide data on wire fraud at their banks and information about their current policies to protect consumers from financial devastation. “Consumers use wire transfers to send large dollar amounts, often to purchase a home or make significant investments, meaning wire fraud is often a life-changing event that can wipe out consumers’ savings or irreparably damage their finances,” the Senators wrote. “Banks have a responsibility to proactively monitor and prevent unauthorized and fraudulently induced transactions. We believe banks should reimburse their customers when they fail to meet these obligations…. With improved fraud prevention and reimbursement practices, consumers would no longer be left on the hook to the tune of billions of dollars annually.” In 2023, consumers lost more than $10 billion due to fraud – up 14 percent from the year before. According to the Federal Trade Commission, in terms of dollars lost, “Bank Transfer or Payment” is the largest payment method used by fraudsters. Senator Reed has been a staunch advocate for protecting consumers from fraud and scams that are often perpetrated on digital payment transfer apps, like Zelle, Venmo, and CashApp. Reed has pushed for new rulemaking that would impose more liability on banks when consumers are tricked into sending money on these apps and has called for federal banking agencies to more closely supervise banks that participate in instant payment app networks to ensure their anti-money laundering (AML) controls are adequate. In January, Reed, Brown, and U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) backed the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s (CFPB) proposed new rule that would expand oversight and supervisory authority over big tech companies that offer digital peer-to-peer mobile payment systems and digital wallet services.\\xa0 A copy of the letter to JPMorgan Chase appears here and below: Dear Mr. Dimon: In light of growing incidences of fraud in the financial system, we write to request information about the protocols and systems you have in place to protect consumers.  In 2023, consumers lost more than $10 billion due to fraud—through both unauthorized and fraudulently induced transactions—up 14 percent from the year before. According to the Federal Trade Commission, in terms of dollars lost, “Bank Transfer or Payment” is the largest payment method used by fraudsters. Additionally, the FBI has received reports of nearly $3 billion in losses associated with “business email compromise” scams overall, which are carried out by fraudsters who compromise email accounts to conduct unauthorized transfers of funds—usually by wire. Those figures are deeply troubling. Consumers use wire transfers to send large dollar amounts, often to purchase a home or make significant investments, meaning wire fraud is often a life-changing event that can wipe out consumers’ savings or irreparably damage their finances.  Banks have a responsibility to proactively monitor and prevent unauthorized and fraudulently induced transactions. We believe banks should reimburse their customers when they fail to meet these obligations. Banks should make consumers whole for unauthorized transactions where a fraudster manages to hack into an account and take money without a consumer’s authorization and for fraudulently induced transactions—specifically, transactions where a consumer was deceived or manipulated into initiating a transfer. With improved fraud prevention and reimbursement practices, consumers would no longer be left on the hook to the tune of billions of dollars annually.

       " \"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse, along with Congressmen Seth Magaziner and Gabe Amo, today introduced a bipartisan resolution marking the 82nd anniversary of the establishment of the United States Naval Construction Force, known as the Seabees.\\xa0 The resolution recognizes the tremendous sacrifices and contributions by the Seabees who have fought and served on behalf of the nation. “Seabees are renowned for their ingenuity, construction and engineering work throughout the world.\\xa0 The Seabees will forever be linked to the Naval Construction Force’s original home here in Rhode Island,” said Reed, the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. “I’m proud to join my colleagues in recognizing the rich history of this elite construction unit.\\xa0 For 82 years, at home and abroad, in times of war and peace, they have contributed to America’s national defense by building military bases, airfields, roads, bridges, and more.” “The remarkable history of the Seabees began right here in Rhode Island,” said Whitehouse.\\xa0 “This resolution highlights the many contributions of the industrious Seabees in service to our country, and recognizes the role the Ocean State has played along the way.” “Since World War II, the Seabees have served our nation by building critical infrastructure that is essential for our troops to succeed in their missions,” said Magaziner. “I’m proud to represent Davisville — home to the first U.S. Navy Construction units and the Seabee Museum & Memorial Park — and I’m partnering with my colleagues in the federal delegation to honor this highly skilled unit and the vital support they provide to the U.S. Armed Forces.” “For 82 years, US Navy Seabees have exemplified unwavering courage, resilience, and ingenuity as an essential part of our nation's military readiness,” said Amo.\\xa0 “Known for their ability to work anywhere — under any circumstances and in any conditions — Seabees embody the ‘Can Do’ spirit us Rhode Islanders know well. This resolution demonstrates our state’s steadfast support for active and retired Seabees and I am proud to join my delegation colleagues in honoring the rich history and legacy of Seabees who call the Ocean State their original home.” Davisville served as home to the first U.S. Navy Construction units, which were established on January 5, 1942.\\xa0 For more than eight decades since, the Seabees have been building critical infrastructure in support of the Navy and Marine Corps overseas. “Since 1942, the Seabees have answered the call to service,” said former U.S. Navy Construction Mechanic Petty Officer 3rd Class\\xa0Tom Santos, Vice President of Fundraising and Marketing for the Seabee Museum and Memorial Park in Davisville, RI, and a member of the\\xa0Navy Seabee\\xa0Foundation Board of Directors. “This resolution recognizes the rich and lasting history of the Seabees and honors their many contributions to our country.” The resolution acknowledges Frank J. Iafrate, a native of North Providence, who designed “The Fighting Bee” logo in 1942 before joining the Naval Construction Force as a Chief Carpenter’s Mate.\\xa0 The logo is still used by the U.S. Navy Seabees today.

       " 'WASHINGTON — The U.S. Air Force has developed a trend of rapid divestment from airborne intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) platforms without producing new capabilities to replace them. These actions leave our troops unprotected, force our Commanders to accept greater risk, and deny our civilian policy makers the best information available before having to decide whether to use military force. On Monday, U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND), member of the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC), led his Senate colleagues in a bipartisan\\xa0letter\\xa0to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, emphasizing the necessity of airborne\\xa0ISR\\xa0and the strategy of investing in both air and space capabilities in order to successfully address our near peer threats and the mission needs of Combatant Commanders. The senators argued the,\\xa0“…importance of\\xa0ISR\\xa0cannot be overstated. Whether it’s getting President Kennedy the information necessary during the Cuban missile crisis, getting our allies and partners what they need to maintain the peace of the Camp David Accords, or feeding and completing the kill chain against near peer adversaries and Violent Extremist Organizations (VEO),\\xa0ISR\\xa0provides the information necessary for the decision makers at every level.”\\xa0 Despite persistent cuts to airborne\\xa0ISR\\xa0platforms such as the retiring of MC-12 Liberty, MQ-1 Predator, E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS), the RQ-4 Global Hawk Block 20s and 30s, and the MQ-9 Block 1, there has been no development of new, modernized airborne\\xa0ISR\\xa0platforms. “While the Air Force divests airborne\\xa0ISR, the Combatant Commanders have repeatedly warned Congress they are not receiving enough\\xa0ISR.\\xa0[…] Admissions like this from top commanders in theater illustrate the concern is not theoretical. There are real-world gaps that must be addressed,”\\xa0the senators continued.\\xa0“The Air Force has a history of cutting\\xa0ISR\\xa0in order to meet other aspirations.\\xa0[…] We look forward to your candid assessment of the responsibility the US Air Force has to provide\\xa0ISR\\xa0capabilities, and we remain ready to contribute to a meaningful solution.” The lawmakers asked Secretary Austin whether the Air Force still has a requirement to provide airborne\\xa0ISR\\xa0capability to the Combatant Commands with sufficient capacity and operational flexibility to meet mission needs; if other services are buying their own\\xa0ISR\\xa0platforms to cover what the Air Force is dropping; if the Air Force’s Total Obligational Authority (TOA) will reflect that drop; and whether it is the United States’ best interest to vacate the airborne ISR domain and rely solely on space-based assets.

       " \"***Click\\xa0here\\xa0to download video. Click\\xa0here\\xa0for audio.*** WASHINGTON – The Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) held a hearing on Tuesday where members heard testimony from Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall, Chief of Staff of the Air Force General David Allvin, and Chief of Space Operations General B. Chance Saltzman. The military leadership were questioned about their Defense Authorization Request for Fiscal Year 2025 and the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP). During the hearing, U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) asked the witnesses about the future of airborne intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities, particularly as it relates to the 319th Reconnaissance Wing located at Grand Forks Air Force Base. He also focused on the current and forthcoming modernization challenges for the B-52.  Yesterday,\\xa0Senator Cramer led\\xa0a bipartisan\\xa0letter\\xa0to\\xa0Defense\\xa0Secretary Austin, critiquing\\xa0the Air Force’s rapid divestment of airborne ISR platforms without producing new capabilities to replace them. The members noted\\xa0the rate of divestment\\xa0without equal\\xa0investment will leave Combatant Commanders forced to accept greater risk and leaves civilian policy makers with less strategic ISR to make informed decisions. Senator Cramer first asked Secretary Kendall how low-density, high-demand units such as the Global Hawk Wing in North Dakota, or other ISR units within the Air Force, fit into its reoptimization plans released in February.\\xa0 “I'm going to go in more at it from the reoptimization plans that were released in February, and my office sent a [Request For Information], asking about how the new Air Force structure might affect the 319th Reconnaissance wing in Grand Forks specifically. This is a very high-demand Air Force base with very few people and assets,”\\xa0said Cramer.\\xa0“How do these\\xa0low-density, high-demand\\xa0units like the Global Hawk Wing in Grand Forks, or other ISR units for that matter around the Air Force, fit into the plan for reoptimization?\\xa0I read all 12 pages [of your testimony] this morning, there’s not a mention of ISR. […] How does Grand Forks fit into reoptimization? ” “It doesn’t directly. The reoptimization of the Great Power Competition is largely about focusing our readiness units on readiness. […] There is no direct correlation between what we're doing under reoptimizing and specific units,” said Secretary Kendall.\\xa0“ISR is a very high priority, […] It's a very big part of our modernization program, separate from the optimization. As we talked about earlier, we're moving a lot of our ISR capacity into space because our airborne platforms, many of them are too vulnerable to attack. [We’ll] keep some airborne platforms, and some space-based capabilities as well. We have requirements to have ISR for less contested environments, more benign environments, as well as highly contested environments,\\xa0so we’re trying\\xa0to have a balanced mix of capabilities and sustain that while we move forward. Some of our legacy capabilities, if you will, are less valuable to us against the pacing challenge, or just not effective against that.” Senator Cramer\\xa0interjected\\xa0modernization is important everywhere, in every mission, and space is critical to it. However, he has recently talked with many people who are frightened about the gap between their ability to find, identify, and hit a target today and over the next few years. Senator Cramer\\xa0then\\xa0asked General Allvin to explain how he foresees the future of airborne ISR unfolding. “While ISR may not be mentioned [in the reoptimization plan] specifically, […] those are the parts called the combat generation wings because they will feed into the larger deployable construct, but we wouldn't expect the entire\\xa0319th\\xa0to be able to go and deploy the entire wing because it's such an [high-demand, low-density] asset,”\\xa0said General Allvin.\\xa0“It needs to be able to be distributed all across so that's why it's part of these combat generation wings.” While B-52 will remain the backbone of the bomber fleet through 2050, Senator Cramer expressed concerns there is a lack of commitment to essential modernization efforts. Senator Cramer probed Secretary Kendall to explain how these B-52 aircrafts will be flown through 2050 without new engines and whether he will commit to finishing the Commercial Engine Replacement Program. “We picked up some rumors over the last couple of days that the Commercial Engine Replacement Program might be in some doubt,”\\xa0said Cramer.\\xa0“Of course, that’d be the reengining of things like the B-52, which has only been around about 60 years and we expect it to be around another 30 or so. Just confirm for me that’s a vicious lie that somebody’s spreading.” Secretary Kendall confirmed the commercial replacement of the B-52 is proceeding. After the open hearing, Senator Cramer proceeded to the classified session with Air Force leadership to go more into detail about the future of ISR at Grand Forks Air Force Base and throughout the Air Force. \\nTags: \\nDefense & Foreign Policy\\n\",\n",

The\\xa0legislation\\xa0would authorize funding for the\\xa0library’s continued construction, ensuring the preservation of President Roosevelt’s history and legacy.\\xa0 “The Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library Act is a wise investment in our nation’s historical preservation. It guarantees that future generations of Americans can access the rich history and enduring impact of Theodore Roosevelt,”\\xa0stated the\\xa0North Dakota Congressional Delegation.\\xa0“As President Roosevelt proudly claimed, he would not have ascended to the presidency had it not been for North Dakota. Fittingly, we are honored that our state should house the institution dedicated to preserving his legacy. We urge our colleagues to swiftly consider and pass this legislation so that all Americans can have access to a world-renowned center for studying President Roosevelt’s visionary leadership and dedication to conservation.”\\xa0 “With the introduction of the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library Act, we honor not just a president, but a transformative leader whose spirit was forged in the rugged beauty of North Dakota,”\\xa0said Governor Doug Burgum.\\xa0“Building on the substantial and essential investments from the state of North Dakota and private donors, this legislation represents a historic opportunity to honor President Roosevelt’s legacy and inspire future generations to embody his values of conservation, leadership and public service. We are grateful to Congressman Armstrong, Senators Hoeven and Cramer, and all partners involved for their steadfast commitment to making this vision a reality.” “This legislation would be instrumental in completing the Library’s construction and help us achieve our goal of opening in time for our nation’s 250th-anniversary celebration,”\\xa0said Edward O’Keefe, CEO of the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library.\\xa0“We are grateful for the support from the North Dakota Congressional Delegation as well as the State of North Dakota and private benefactors who have made this project possible. This legislation would be pivotal to the project’s development and establish the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library as the nation’s premier institution for bringing the legacy of this 20th-century President to a 21st-century citizenry.” “Preserving Theodore Roosevelt’s legacy isn’t just about honoring the past, it’s about shaping the future,”\\xa0said Theodore ‘Ted’ Roosevelt V, the great-great-grandson of President Theodore Roosevelt.\\xa0“With the\\xa0approval of this\\xa0legislation, Congress will help ensure that the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library will be a beacon of inspiration, reminding us all of the values of conservation, leadership, and courage that define our national character.

       " 'WASHINGTON – In 2023, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized a rule which rolls back the state preemption of in-use locomotives regulation, opening\\xa0the door to the California Air Resources Board’s (CARB) waiver to implement stricter regulations on in-use locomotive emissions than the national standard. CARB’s In-Use Locomotive Regulation would prohibit the operation of locomotives in California more than 23 years after manufacture unless those locomotives are operated in a zero-emissions configuration. Because this technology is not commercially available today, the regulation would impose significant operational and financial burdens on freight railroads operating in California, including both Class I’s and short line railroads. On Tuesday, U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer joined U.S. Senator Pete Ricketts (R-NE) and his Senate colleagues in a letter to EPA Administrator Michael Regan opposing CARB’s rule which would jeopardize the rail industry, threaten supply chains, and derail our economy. “Attempts to create state-specific operational rules, such as those envisioned by CARB, would jeopardize the interoperability of the national network and would threaten the overall health of the supply chain,” wrote the senators. “CARB has stated its goal is to force the railroads to convert their national fleets to the currently unavailable and untested zero-emission locomotives. The CAA does not grant EPA the authority to allow states to mandate specifications for the design and manufacture of locomotives – which is precisely what CARB seeks in its authorization request.” “If the EPA were to approve CARB’s authorization request, the results would be devastating for the rail industry and, subsequently, the economy as a whole,” added the senators. “In addition, the financial strain the spending account requirement of the Regulation would place on railroads could be multiplied across each other state that chooses to adopt the Regulation. Finally, the EPA’s actions could jeopardize the supply chain by forcing railroads to utilize largely unproven technology to power the locomotives.” Joining Senators Cramer and Ricketts are U.S. Senators Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Joe Manchin (D-WV), John Boozman (R-AR), Mike Braun (R-IN), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Deb Fischer (R-NE), John Hoeven (R-ND), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Roger Marshall (R-KS), and Roger Wicker (R-MS). The letter is supported by the Red River Valley & Western Railroad Company, the Association of American Railroads (AAR), and the American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association (ASLRRA). “Red River\\xa0Valley and Western\\xa0Railroad Company thanks Senator Cramer for his support of the short line railroad industry in North Dakota and nationwide,” said President Vic Meyers.\\xa0“Senator Cramer’s leadership in opposing the CARB in-use locomotive regulation is helping to ensure that short line railroads can continue to remain a viable, safe, and reliable supply chain solution into the future.” “Rail is already a solution to reducing transportation emissions,”\\xa0said AAR President and CEO Ian Jefferies. \"Despite significant progress and railroad investment to advance zero-emissions technologies, there are no commercially viable options today – and they cannot simply be willed into existence by the state of California. If allowed to proceed, the CARB rule stands to upend rail operations across the interconnected national network without resulting in any actual emissions reductions.” “We commend Sen. Ricketts and his colleagues for their important leadership on this issue,”\\xa0said\\xa0ASLRRA President\\xa0Chuck Baker.\\xa0“Their letter conveys a fundamental message to EPA: \\xa0the federal government must stop California’s misguided measure in its tracks. This state-level mandate requires small railroads to pay draconian compliance costs, discard useful and practical locomotives decades before the end of their useful lives, and acquire new locomotives that are not yet commercially viable in order to meet completely arbitrary deadlines. CARB’s rule will be the death knell for small railroads in California if it’s allowed to proceed, and if other states follow this clearly illegal rulemaking, small railroads nationwide will shutter, crippling the country’s supply chain and increasing congestion and air pollution on the nation’s highways – ironically, exactly what CARB claims it wants to curtail.” Click here to read the full letter. \\nTags: \\nJobs and the Economy, Energy and the Environment\\n',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON – At the beginning of March, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) finalized its climate disclosure rule, requiring publicly traded companies to disclose their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data. Upon implementation, this final rule will stifle economic opportunity while raising costs for consumers. U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND), member of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, joined Ranking Member Tim Scott (R-SC) in introducing a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution of disapproval to nullify the SEC’s climate disclosure rule. The resolution will protect small business owners and stakeholders from burdensome regulations and preserve U.S. capital markets. Further, the legislation will safeguard economic opportunity throughout the country. \\xa0 “The SEC’s\\xa0climate\\xa0disclosure\\xa0rule is completely outside the scope of its mandate,” said Cramer. “Under no circumstance should the SEC be concerned about direct or indirect emissions data because Congress never gave them this authority.\\xa0The SEC rule is the embodiment of the president’s extreme climate change agenda, designed to hinder American energy and bog down companies in endless, liability-laden reporting. It is already failing in court, and Congress should overturn it as well.”  “The SEC’s final climate disclosure rule threatens economic opportunity across the country, and it must be overturned. Over and over again, SEC Chair Gensler has disregarded the real-world impacts of his aggressive regulatory agenda in his dogged pursuit of left-wing political priorities. This rule is no exception. The SEC’s mission is to regulate our capital markets and ensure all Americans can safely share in their economic success – not to force a partisan climate agenda on American businesses. This rule is federal overreach at its worst, and the SEC should stay in its lane,” said Ranking Member Scott. Organizations supporting this legislation include Heritage Action for America, Americans for Tax Reform, American Energy Alliance, Americans for Prosperity, and the American Petroleum Institute. In addition to Senators Cramer and Scott, cosponsors of the resolution include U.S. Senators John Barrasso (R-WY), John Boozman (R-AR), Mike Braun (R-IN), Katie Britt (R-AL), Ted Budd (R-NC), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), John Cornyn (R-TX), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Steve Daines (R-MT), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), John Hoeven (R-ND), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Ron Johnson (R-WI), John Kennedy (R-LA), James Lankford (R-OK), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Pete Ricketts (R-NE), Jim Risch (R-ID), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Rick Scott (R-FL), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), John Thune (R-SD), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), and J.D.

In January, Senator Cramer joined Senator Capito in sending a\\xa0letter\\xa0to SEC Chair Gary Gensler, expressing their disapproval of the rule due to its negative impact on domestic energy producers, their access to capital, and higher energy prices. After the SEC announced its final climate disclosure rule in March, Senator Cramer issued a statement denouncing the mandate.

This resolution serves to bring national attention to the maternal health crisis in the United States and the critical need to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity rates among Black mothers.\\xa0 The resolution underscores the disproportionate health complications suffered by Black birthing people during pregnancy who face a maternal mortality rate two to three times that of their white counterparts due to structural racism and gender oppression in maternal health care experiences. The ongoing rise in maternal mortality rates, especially among Black mothers, highlights the persistent disparity in health care access and outcomes. In order to reverse these alarming trends, the resolution calls on Congress to “support and encourage policies grounded in the human rights, reproductive justice, and birth justice frameworks that address Black maternal health inequity.”\\xa0 “The structural inequities and systemic biases driving alarming mortality rates among Black mothers demand immediate action,” said Senator Booker. “We must guarantee access to comprehensive care and support for both Black mothers and their babies, and prioritize policies that effectively address the disparities in care Black families face when bringing new life into this world. I am proud to have worked alongside my colleagues on this resolution to promote community-driven solutions, increase access to quality, affordable health care, and tackle the maternal health crisis head on.”\\xa0 “I am proud to co-lead this resolution with Senator Booker to mark this week as Black Maternal Health Week,” said Senator Laphonza Butler. “We must acknowledge the major gaps in maternal care, especially when it comes to Black mothers and babies. I’m grateful for BMMA’s continued advocacy in protecting moms before, during, and after pregnancy.” \"During Black Maternal Health Week we recognize maternal health disparities and recommit to creating a world where maternal justice and equality are a reality,\" said Congresswoman Alma S. Adams, Ph.D., co-founder and co-chair of the Black Maternal Health Caucus. \"We are working diligently to pass the full Momnibus Act package to comprehensively address existing gaps in policy solutions to the maternal health crisis. Since introducing the first resolution recognizing Black Maternal Health Week in 2018 with then-Senator Kamala Harris, and launching the Black Maternal Health Caucus with Rep. Underwood in 2019, we have made great strides to ending this crisis. I\\'m proud to introduce the Black Maternal Health Week Resolution alongside Congresswoman Lauren Underwood and Senators Cory Booker and Laphonza Butler. We must act urgently to address this crisis, because our mamas can\\'t wait.\" “It is unconscionable that in 2024, the United States remains one of the most dangerous countries on Earth to give birth,” said Representative Underwood, co-founder and co-chair of the Black Maternal Health Caucus. “Moms across our country are demanding a comprehensive solution to our maternal health crisis, and they cannot afford to wait. I’m thrilled to join my colleagues again in introducing this resolution officially designating this week as Black Maternal Health Week, and I’m thankful for the Black Mama’s Matter Alliance’s visionary leadership in establishing this moment of action and attention. We must continue to advocate for our moms and to pass the entire Momnibus now.” \\xa0 \"Black Mamas Matter Alliance thanks Senators Cory Booker and Laphonza Butler and Representatives Alma Adams and Lauren Underwood for their leadership in introducing this year\\'s Black Maternal Health Week Resolution and for being dedicated advocates for the Momnibus Act. By centering Black-led and centered community-based organizations that understand the cultural nuances and challenges faced by Black women and birthing people, we can ensure that policies and programs are not only effective but also respectful of the dignity and autonomy that ALL Black Mamas deserve.

Booker and Fetterman are members of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. “This GAO report shows that federal agencies purchase nearly $10 billion of fruits and vegetables each year, yet have no legal requirements to source any of that produce locally,” said Senator Booker. “A substantial increase in local purchases of fruits and vegetables by federal agencies could benefit small farmers and local and regional food systems around the country, and this type of large scale local sourcing by the federal government needs to become a priority.” \"I\\'m pleased to have commissioned this GAO report with Senator Booker,\" said Senator Fetterman. \"We must invest in small farmers –\\xa0and this report gives us the data we need to do just that. The report finds that nearly half of USDA and DOD domestic food spending is sourced from small local businesses. It\\'s clear that the Biden administration is working with local farmers to increase American food production and get that number up.\\xa0I look forward to continuing to work with the administration, Senator Booker, and the rest of my colleagues on this important effort.\" The comprehensive report sheds light on the significant role played by AMS and DLA in sourcing domestic\\xa0food\\xa0from approved vendors\\xa0for schools, food banks,\\xa0Indian reservations\\xa0and military installations. With over $33 billion for food contracts sourced within the United States from domestic vendors between fiscal years 2018 and 2022, the report underscores the substantial impact of federal food purchasing decisions on domestic food production and marketing, including the production of locally grown food.\\xa0AMS and DLA accounted for over 90 percent of these federal food purchases Both AMS and DLA have prioritized small business participation, with over 45% of the obligated amounts\\xa0going to contracts with small businesses. This investment of $13.6 billion in small business participation is important for fostering an environment that encourages the growth and success of small businesses, which are the backbone of our economy. Additionally, the report\\xa0discusses\\xa0efforts by AMS and DLA to support the purchase of locally grown food, but highlights the fact that\\xa0there are no specific requirements for the agencies to\\xa0source locally.\\xa0AMS offers financial assistance to states and tribal governments to increase the availability of locally grown food. DLA encourages vendors to consider sourcing food locally, and for the USDA DOD Fresh program, it requires vendors to provide information about where the food was grown.\\xa0These initiatives reflect a growing\\xa0recognition of the importance of local and regional\\xa0sourcing practices.\\xa0 The full text of the report can be found here. \\nTags: \\nFood & Agriculture\\n',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.), member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Chair of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on State and Foreign Operations (SFOPS), today celebrated committee passage of his bipartisan legislation with Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Ranking Member of SFOPS, to create a U.S. Foundation for International Conservation. The bill passed out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee this morning. “The U.S. Foundation for International Conservation would fund public-private partnerships to support local communities around the world in effectively managing protected and conserved areas,” said Senator Coons. “This bipartisan bill would increase the flow of private and philanthropic capital, in coordination with U.S. government investment, to conserve biodiversity, promote stability and security, and ensure the communities who live and work around protected areas drive their own future. On my recent congressional delegation to five countries in Africa and during my many trips to the developing world throughout my time in the Senate, I’ve seen the immensely positive impact that investing in conservation can have on local communities. I’d like to thank my Senate Foreign Relations Committee colleagues for joining me in a strong, bipartisan fashion to advance my legislation with Senator Graham to increase investment in the future of our planet, and I will continue working to pass this bill into law.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 “The Foundation for International Conservation is a win-win in that the bill leverages private capital while supporting the long-term protection of critical landscapes around the world,” said Senator Graham. “Investments in conservation lead to food security and regional stability. I am proud to work with Senator Coons, my colleagues, and stakeholders to position the United States as a leader in international conservation.”\\xa0 The bill is cosponsored by Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Pete Ricketts (R-Neb.), and Tim Kaine (D-Va.). A companion bill passed the House Foreign Affairs Committee last month, led by Chairman Michael McCaul (R-Texas) and Ranking Member Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.), by a vote of 42-7. “Once in a generation a new idea comes along that takes root in America to support natural resource management for the future,” said David H. Barron, Founder, International Conservation Caucus Foundation. “Today, the United States Senate took a step forward to advance the formation of the United States Foundation for International Conservation to provide conservation leadership support for national parks and protected areas in Africa, Asia, and Latin America for the benefit of their peoples, their communities, and their biodiversity. Thanks to Senators Coons, Graham, and others, that can now become a reality.” “As stewards of the earth, we stand at a critical juncture where the decisions we make today will shape the future of our planet,” said Kaddu Sebunya, CEO, African Wildlife Foundation. “The passage of the U.S. Foundation for International Conservation Act by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is a resounding declaration of commitment to safeguarding our shared natural heritage. Protected and conserved areas in Africa are not just boundaries on a map; they are vibrant ecosystems teeming with life, sustaining both biodiversity and local economies. Yet, these vital sanctuaries face unprecedented threats, from poaching to habitat loss. The establishment of the foundation signifies a monumental step towards ensuring their conservation for generations to come. By investing in conservation, we not only protect wildlife but also empower communities, bolster economies, and secure a sustainable future for all. Now is the time for bold action, and together, we must advocate for mutually beneficial people-centric solutions that are sustainable and attainable.” “Today, we reached a major milestone for boosting conservation efforts on the global stage,” said Jennifer Morris, CEO, The Nature Conservancy. “The Senate Foreign Relations Committee’s approval of the U.S. Foundation for International Conservation Act comes just weeks after the act cleared a key House committee. The bipartisan momentum behind this bill is a testament to how important it is to establish long-term, sustainable financing for the conservation of threatened lands and bodies of water. Protecting nature isn’t just good for the United States and the health of our planet; it can also boost global stability. At The Nature Conservancy, we have witnessed firsthand how these investments can be transformative – for people and nature, as well as safety and security. This combination of U.S. investment and philanthropic funding will stimulate economic growth and empower local and Indigenous communities. We urge lawmakers to keep this pace and pass the legislation quickly so we can unlock the potential of these needed investments to create a more stable and healthy world.” “Conservation International applauds the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee passing the U.S. Foundation for International Conservation Act to protect nature in some of the most important and vulnerable places on Earth,” said Pasha Majdi, Vice President, U.S. Government Policy and Strategy, Conservation International. “We thank the bipartisan leadership from Chairman [Ben] Cardin [D-Md.] and Ranking Member [James] Risch [R-Idaho], the steadfast commitment from Senators Coons and Graham, and Senators Tillis, Boozman, Whitehouse, Heinrich, Ricketts, and Kaine to advance the bill. This public-private partnership with leading philanthropists will provide a pathway for financing global conservation projects to build a more prosperous future. Now that both the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee have passed the bill with overwhelming bipartisan support, Conservation International calls on Congress to pass the bill this year.” “Today’s action in the Senate to advance the U.S. Foundation for International Conservation Act is a major step forward in reaffirming American leadership to protect nature around the globe,” said Alejandro Pérez, Senior Vice President of Policy and Government Affairs, World Wildlife Fund. “Nature is under increasing threat, and we need to find ways to mobilize significant new finance from both the public and private sectors if we are to address this challenge at the scale required. By creating a new U.S. Foundation for International Conservation, this legislation will help to forge new public-private partnerships to conserve essential landscapes and seascapes and the natural resources they provide. The WWF commends the bipartisan group of lawmakers that has now advanced this legislation through committees in both the House and Senate. We urge both chambers of Congress to pass it into law in order to strengthen U.S. government partnerships with the private sector, local communities, and developing countries that will help protect our planet and the people who depend on it.” “The U.S. Foundation for International Conservation Act would bring together the public and private sectors to ensure protected areas provide economic, environmental, social, and cultural benefits both locally and globally,” said John Calvelli, Executive Vice President of Public Affairs, Wildlife Conservation Society. “Thank you to the U.S. Senate bill (S.618) champions Senators Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) for leadership in shepherding the bill through the Senate. Thank you, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chair Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and Ranking Member James Risch (R-Idaho) for advancing this important bill through committee.” “Pew is gratified that the committee has acted to advance legislation that by leveraging private and public sector funds will both lead to an increase in protected areas around the world as well as help maintain the long-term management of existing conserved and protected areas globally,” said Tom Dillon, Senior Vice President for Environment, The Pew Charitable Trusts.\\xa0“The establishment of the foundation would demonstrate U.S. leadership in international conservation, promote sustainable development, and enhance global stability by strengthening partnerships with developing countries and combating activities such as wildlife trafficking and illegal deforestation.” A text of the bill is available here.\\xa0 More information on the U.S. Foundation for International Conservation is available here. \\xa0',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) introduced legislation to reduce the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) and the U.S. Marshals Service’s use of solitary confinement and improve conditions for adults in custody separated from the general prison population.\\xa0 The\\xa0Solitary Confinement Reform Act limits the use of solitary confinement in certain prison\\xa0facilities to the shortest term and the least restrictive\\xa0conditions\\xa0possible, improves access to mental health services for adult BOP prisoners in solitary confinement, and provides resources to state and local jurisdictions to assist them in reforming their own confinement practices. The bill also protects adult inmates’ civil rights through the creation of a Civil Rights Ombudsman position and bans the practice of placing LGBTQ inmates in solitary confinement as a means of protection.\\xa0 “Solitary confinement doesn’t achieve its stated goals of improving safety in prisons or reducing recidivism among prison populations,” said Senator Coons. “Instead, it can cause lasting psychological damage in incarcerated individuals. There are more effective, humane practices that maintain the safety and security of correctional officers, prison staff, and people behind bars. I’m glad to join with Chair Durbin in this effort to move us closer to a criminal justice system that focuses on rehabilitation and justice at its core.” “The goal of our criminal justice system should be to rehabilitate offenders and prepare them for successful reentry into our society,” said Senator Durbin.\\xa0“We have had some success – like the landmark\\xa0First Step Act – but the continued overuse of solitary confinement undermines this objective, causing psychological harm that is difficult, if not impossible, to undo. I’ve had the opportunity to hear directly from men like Anthony Graves, who spent 16 years in solitary confinement for a crime he didn’t commit, about the devastating toll of isolation. That’s why I’m certain of the need to restrict and reform the use of solitary confinement in the United States.” According to a report by the Government Accountability Office – requested by Senators Coons, Durbin, and others – as of October 2023, the BOP has not fully implemented 54 of the 87 recommendations from the two prior studies on improving restrictive housing practices. Following the independent assessment in 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice undertook a review of BOP’s use of solitary confinement. In January 2016, President Barack Obama announced that he had accepted a number of DOJ’s recommendations to reform and reduce the practice of solitary confinement in the federal prison system, including implementing the ban on juvenile solitary confinement. The Federal Bureau of Prisons began implementing these changes and, until the Trump administration, the numbers continued trending downward. While this previous decline was encouraging, there was still a need for further reform measures. Senators Durbin and Coons first introduced the\\xa0Solitary Confinement Reform Act\\xa0in 2016 to codify and build upon DOJ’s recommendations. In addition to Senators Coons and Durbin, this legislation is also cosponsored by U.S. Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii). Senator Coons is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and Co-Chair of the Senate Law Enforcement Caucus. Senator Durbin is Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee. \\xa0',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.) applauded the Senate’s unanimous passage of his resolution that condemns the human rights record of the government of Eswatini and the killing of Eswatini human rights activist Thulani Maseko. This resolution is cosponsored by U.S. Senators Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), and Tim Scott (R-S.C.). Eswatini is Africa’s last absolute monarchy, currently ruled by King Mswati III. Human rights abuses in the kingdom are common, including unlawful killings, arbitrary detention, and serious restrictions on freedom of expression. This resolution calls on the government of Eswatini to conduct a transparent and thorough investigation into the assassination of Maseko, a prominent human rights lawyer in Eswatini who was shot and killed by an unknown gunman on January 21, 2023.\\xa0Eswatini authorities have failed to announce progress on an independent investigation into Maseko’s killing, and more must be done to hold those responsible accountable and protect human rights in Eswatini. “I applaud the passage of my bipartisan resolution condemning the human rights record of the government of Eswatini and the brutal murder of Thulani Maseko, who was a strong advocate for human rights,” said Senator Coons. “Maseko fought tirelessly to improve human rights and civil liberties in the kingdom. However, more than a year after his death, no substantial progress on an independent investigation into his killing has been made. Even worse, his family members – including his widow, Tanele Maseko – continue to face harassment at the hands of the government. I condemn the kingdom’s failure to undertake an independent investigation into Maseko’s assassination, and I will continue to fight for justice for him and his family. I will also continue working with my colleagues in the Senate to seek wider improvements to the kingdom’s human rights record.” “I am pleased the Senate passed my resolution with Senator Coons condemning Eswatini’s human rights record and Thulani Maseko’s murder,” said Senator Risch. “The Eswatini government should heed the Senate’s call to fully probe Maseko’s murder, uphold human rights, and conduct meaningful and comprehensive dialogue on democratic reforms.” “Thulani Maseko was a dedicated advocate for human rights and civil liberties in Eswatini,” said Senator Booker. “I am pleased that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have come together to condemn this murder and urge accountability and justice for his family. We must continue our work to protect and defend human rights in Eswatini and beyond.”\\xa0 “‘Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves’ is a constant reminder in Scripture for the role of any public servant,” said Senator Scott. “I’m grateful for the Senate unanimously condemning the worsening cycle of political violence and suppression of free speech in Eswatini. Transparency and accountability must be restored with respect to public officials complicit in extrajudicial killings, torture, and other egregious human rights violations.” Senator Coons is Chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee on State and Foreign Operations (SFOPS), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Co-Chair of the Senate Human Rights Caucus.

       " 'WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Chris Coons (D-Del.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), and Tim Scott (R-S.C.) introduced legislation to address antisemitic sentiment and actions on college campuses, which has been rising across the nation for years and spiked in the wake of Hamas’ terrorist attack on October 7, 2023. The Antisemitism Awareness Act would require the U.S. Department of Education to consider the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism when enforcing federal anti-discrimination laws.\\xa0 “No one should be attacked or made to feel afraid because of whom or how they worship,” said Senator Coons. “More action is clearly needed to ensure Jewish students are protected from antisemitic hatred that has been rising in our communities and across the country over recent years and has spiked since the horrific terrorist attacks of October 7. Adopting the IHRA’s definition of antisemitism will ensure that those promoting bigotry on college campuses are held accountable, and this bill gives the Department of Education the clear guidance it needs to do its job.” “Hamas’ horrific terrorist attack on October 7 led to a dramatic increase in antisemitism on college campuses,” said Senator Casey. “Amidst this appalling increase, we must do everything we can to protect Jewish students on college campuses. This bill will make sure that going forward, the Education Department will take action against all forms of antisemitic discrimination.” “Our nation’s institutions of higher learning have become hotbeds of antisemitism, especially in the wake of the brutal attacks against Israel and innocent civilians by Hamas and Iran,” said Senator Scott. “It’s critical the Department of Education has the tools and resources it needs to investigate antisemitism and root out this vile hatred wherever it rears its ugly head.” In addition to Senators Coons, Casey, and Scott, the Antisemitism Awareness Act is cosponsored by U.S. Senators Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Katie Britt (R-Ala.), John Fetterman (D-Pa.), Pete Ricketts (R-Neb.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), and Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.). The Antisemitism Awareness Act would direct the Department of Education to use the IHRA definition of antisemitism, an important tool in addressing and identifying the various manifestations of prejudice and hate against the state of Israel and the Jewish community.\\xa0This bill would codify the Department of Education’s existing practice of taking into account the IHRA definition when investigating violations of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

       " 'Today, U.S. Representative Matt Cartwright (PA-08) and Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Lawler (NY-17) re-introduced the\\xa0Help Extend Auditory Relief\\xa0 (HEAR)\\xa0Act\\xa0to expand hearing benefits for seniors on Medicare. Approximately 15 percent of American adults (41 million) report some degree of hearing loss, according to the CDC’s National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). This includes nearly one-third of individuals aged 65-74 and nearly half of those over 75. Left untreated, hearing loss can dramatically impact the health and wellbeing of older adults. Research indicates that older adults with hearing loss experience a faster decline in cognitive abilities and have a greater risk of developing dementia compared to older adults with normal hearing. Hearing loss can also increase social isolation and loneliness and has even been linked to an increased risk for falls, among seniors. For many individuals, hearing aids offer a simple solution. They are dependable, nearly invisible, and can significantly improve quality of life. Yet for older adults on fixed incomes, hearing aids can be prohibitively expensive. This is especially true for older adults who require prescription hearing aids, which can range from $1,000 to $6,000 per pair. Despite this, traditional Medicare does not cover prescription hearing aids or related hearing services. The\\xa0Help Extend Auditory Relief (HEAR) Act\\xa0would rectify this by: ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Requiring Medicare to cover prescription hearing aids; and ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Requiring Medicare to cover hearing rehabilitation services, including a comprehensive audiology assessment to determine if a hearing aid is appropriate, a threshold test to determine audio acuity, and various services associated with fitting, adjusting, and using hearing aids. “Hearing loss among older Americans is common, and more serious conditions like depression and anxiety often follow if it’s not addressed. Exams and hearing aids are simple ways to mitigate hearing loss, but those resources are far too costly without insurance coverage,”\\xa0said Rep. Cartwright. “This common-sense bill supported by both Democrats and Republicans will extend Medicare coverage for prescription hearing aid devices so seniors can access these life-enhancing solutions without breaking their bank.” “I’m thrilled to be co-leading the Help Extend Auditory Relief (HEAR Act) with Representative Cartwright, which would expand Medicare access for millions of Americans, ensuring they have the ability to get the hearing aids they need and deserve,” said Congressman Lawler. “I will never stop fighting for our seniors, those who are disabled, and those who need a helping hand - we are judged by how we treat the most vulnerable in our society, and this bill goes a long way towards helping them.” Elements of this bill were included in the landmark\\xa0Lower Drug Costs Now Act, passed by the U.S. House in December 2019. The taxpayer savings generated from empowering Medicare to take on big drug companies and negotiate lower prices for Americans on Medicare and private insurance would have been partly reinvested to implement the HEAR Act’s provisions to expand Medicare Part B coverage of \\xa0hearing benefits. This legislation is endorsed by the Center for Hearing and Deaf Services, Hearing Loss Association of America,\\xa0Center for Advocacy for the Rights and Interests of the Elderly (CARIE) and the SeniorLAW Center.  “With one in five Pennsylvanians being over 65 there is growing number of seniors having hearing loss,” said Barbara Kelley, Executive Director of the Hearing Loss Association of America. “Representative Cartwright’s legislation will help people afford hearing aids to stay engaged, active and in many cases, working beyond age 65. Hearing health is part of overall health, and the cost of hearing aids can be a barrier to treatment. This bill will help reduce those barriers.” This legislation is co-sponsored by U.S. Reps. Mike Lawler (R-NY-17), Tony Cardenas (D-CA-29), Madeleine Dean (D-PA-04), Raul Grijalva (D-AZ-03), Betty McCollum (D-MN-04), Mark Takano (D-CA-39) and Mike Thompson (D-CA-05).',\n",

We must act now and decisively to safeguard all workers from heat stress and extreme temperatures.” “Americans across the country are grappling with some of the hottest temperatures on record.

Washington, D.C. – At a hearing to review the Fiscal Year 2025 budget request for the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, U.S. Senator Susan Collins, Vice Chair of the Appropriations Committee and Subcommittee on Defense, questioned Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Lisa Franchetti on efforts to reduce the submarine maintenance backlog and highlighted the role federal funding plays in supporting the critical work being done at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard (PNSY) to maintain our Navy’s fleet. During Q&A with Admiral Franchetti, Senator Collins said: The Shipyard Infrastructure Optimization Program, SIOP, and the Ship Depot Maintenance line item are both well-resourced in the budget request.\\xa0 I support these needed investments in the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, and in our other shipyards, because during the past decade, fewer than one third of the Navy's attack submarines have completed maintenance on time. Last year, Navy officials conceded that there were nearly twice as many non-deployable submarines as were anticipated because of maintenance or other issues.\\xa0 This is a trend that we simply have to reverse.\\xa0 To what extent – and we make the investments in the budget – can we expect that the submarine maintenance backlog will decline? Admiral Franchetti: As you know, our submarines are our true asymmetric advantage, and we really do need to improve on our overall submarine maintenance. … the Shipyard Infrastructure Optimization Program, you know, this is a once in a generation, really once in 100-year overhaul, of our four public shipyards.\\xa0 We really appreciate the investments in those shipyards, because they are so critical to that maintenance that you're talking about.\\xa0 And this is recapitalization of the dry docks.\\xa0 It is a reorganization of the shipyard, to ensure that the flow of the work across the shipyard will be effective and more efficient as we're doing that maintenance. And then of course, upgrading the equipment that is part of that, is all part of the Shipyard [Infrastructure] Optimization Program that we're putting in place.\\xa0 And I think you will really see those investments pay off over many years… As far as getting our submarines out of the shipyard on time, you know, we've made a lot of progress in putting in place processes that help us look at the data analytics, so we can better understand where are the choke points, what are the barriers to getting our submarines out of maintenance on time, and then working to implement the corrections.\\xa0 We've put the head of our submarine force in charge of that overall process last year, to really drive the operational demand, and understand the sense of urgency that we need in each one of our shipyards to be able to get them out on time. One of the other things we've found was that a shortage of supply parts and a rotatable pool would be a way, so we put that in our budget for last year.\\xa0 We're looking forward to getting those all on contract now.\\xa0 A little bit delayed, about six months delayed, but we will get that in there, and then expect to see positive results of having those spare parts and long lead time materials in place ahead of time to expedite that maintenance. Senator Collins: The Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, is the gold standard… I've visited there many times and the physical constraints are a real barrier.\\xa0 And that's why the SIOP Program has been absolutely critical. +++ Senator Collins secured substantial funding in the Fiscal Year 2024 appropriations package for PNSY to address its modernization needs and support its vital work to enhance our national security. As the Vice Chair of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Collins is pressing forward with Chair Patty Murray (D-WA) to hold subcommittee hearings on the President’s budget request.\\xa0 These hearings provide an important opportunity to assess our country’s needs for the coming year and will help guide Senators Collins and Murray’s efforts to write the annual government funding bills. ###\",\n",
       " 'Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Joe Manchin (D-WV) led a bipartisan group of 22 Members of Congress, including Senator Angus King and Representative Jared Golden, in sending a letter to United States Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, opposing the United States Postal Service’s (USPS) recent nationwide consolidation and review announcements that could severely diminish mail service reliability for postal networks across the country. These announcements include a planned conversion of the Hampden facility into a Local Processing Center (LPC), which would force outgoing mail processing to the Southern Maine Processing and Distribution Center in Scarborough, 130 miles south of the Hampden facility. The Hampden facility is important for mail delivery across large parts of Maine. For example, mail currently sent from Fort Kent to Wallagrass, 10 miles away, is processed in Hampden, 192 miles away. It then returns the following day by truck to Wallagrass, which is 182 miles away. Under the new proposal, this mail would have to be transported to Scarborough, 322 miles away from Fort Kent, and then be sent at least another 312 miles back to Wallgrass. “A common theme of these announcements is the so-called ‘modernization’ of Processing and Distribution Centers into Local Processing Centers,” the Members wrote. “Taken together, these proposals dismantle parts of the Postal Service’s robust network that helps distribute mail across the country and places outgoing sorting into more distant facilities.\\xa0The result of this change is that mail will need to travel farther from its origin to its sorting, creating inefficiencies in the system, especially for local mail.” “These consolidation proposals never have had any discernible support from local communities.\\xa0On the contrary, we have heard strong opposition to these efforts from USPS customers, community leaders, local businesses, and postal employees,” the Members continued. “Rather than marching forward with these plans and offering short and vague statements dismissing concerns, the Postal Service should be communicating why the organization believes these changes are beneficial and what the specific impact of the changes will be to mail service.” “The Postal Service provides an essential service upon which our constituents rely. The robust nature of the Postal Service’s current network is its strength, not its weakness.\\xa0 To ensure that our constituents continue to receive reliable service, we urge you to reconsider these consolidation announcements,” the Members concluded. Senator Collins has fought against proposed changes to the Hampden Plant since 2012, when she led the effort to halt a proposed complete closure of the Hampden plant. In November 2023, she\\xa0penned a letter to Postmaster General Louis DeJoy\\xa0objecting to the proposal to consolidate outgoing operations of Maine’s two USPS processing facilities.\\xa0 Senator Collins also provided comments for a public meeting on the proposal in February. Prior to this, Senator Collins wrote to Postmaster DeJoy several times, addressing concerns about\\xa0delivery delays\\xa0and\\xa0workforce retention\\xa0in Maine and across the national postal network. Additionally, she\\xa0met with the USPS Inspector General\\xa0last fall to discuss their examination of Postal Service quality in Southern Maine. Senator King has been a vocal supporter of the USPS’s critical role in American society and in Maine, one of the nation’s oldest and most rural states that relies heavily on the services provided by the USPS to receive prescriptions and other necessities. Most recently, he joined the Maine Congressional Delegation in writing a letter to Postmaster General DeJoy to address delayed mail across five delivery units in Southern Maine. This month, he also joined his colleagues in sending a letter to Postmaster General Louis DeJoy urging him to stop any changes to the USPS service standards that would result in job losses and further degrade mail delivery performance, especially in rural states like Maine. On Monday, Congressman Golden and Representative August Pfluger (R-TX) announced the introduction of The Timely Mail Delivery and Postal Services Act, a bipartisan bill that would freeze consolidation of mail processing facilities across the country and require independent review by the Postal Regulatory Commission of any future, similar consolidation plans. In addition to Senators Collins, Manchin, and King and Representative Golden, the letter was also signed by Senators Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Peter Welch (D-VT), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), and Representatives Steve Womack (R-AR), Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE), Barry Loudermilk (R-GA), Eric Sorensen (D-IL), Nikki Budzinski (D-IL), Jack Bergman (R-MI), Mark Alford (R-MO), Emanuel Cleaver (D-MO), Mike Ezell (R-MS), and Chris Pappas (D-NH).\\xa0 ###',\n",
       " \"Click HERE to watch and HERE to download. Washington, D.C. – At a hearing to review the Fiscal Year 2025 budget request for the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), U.S. Senator Susan Collins, Vice Chair of the Appropriations Committee, questioned U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland on what federal law enforcement is doing to help shut down illegal Chinese marijuana growing operations in Maine and support the efforts of state, county, and local law enforcement. During Q&A with Attorney General Garland, Senator Collins said: Particularly in our rural communities, Chinese nationals are establishing and operating illegal marijuana growing operations.\\xa0 I first raised concerns about this problem in June of 2022.\\xa0 Thanks to the work of some enterprising Maine journalists, we now know that there are more than 200 such operations operating in houses across our state.\\xa0 And by the way, those houses are forever ruined by the operations, and that contributes to our housing shortage as well.  Last month, I asked the FBI Director about this matter during his open testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee.\\xa0 While the Director cited the FBI's efforts to support task force and secure indictments, he was unable to answer a fundamental, troubling question, and that is, why is China sending its citizens, sneaking them into the country, to open illegal marijuana operations in rural Maine communities.  Just recently, three Chinese nationals were apprehended as they crossed the border illegally in northern Maine.  Now, we've had a tremendous effort by state, county, and local law enforcement to identify and start shutting down these illegal operations.\\xa0 But there are very clear federal interests here, particularly with respect to national security.  Two days ago, your Office of Legislative Affairs finally responded to four inquiries that I had sent to the Department on this topic.\\xa0 But unfortunately, the response letter provided almost no substantive information on whether the Department is making this a priority, working with state, local, and county law enforcement, and exploring the national security implications.\\xa0 And I do recognize there's a limit to what you can say in a letter of that sort.  But General Garland, what are the Criminal Division, the National Security Division, and the U.S. Attorney's Office in Maine doing to address these illegal growing operations? And, in particular, what are they doing to support the tremendous, but under-resourced effort at the state, county, and local level? Attorney General Garland: Senator, you've raised a serious problem.\\xa0 It's not only a Maine problem.\\xa0 So, DEA is reporting that there are transnational criminal organizations in some 20 states that are not so much grow houses, but illegal marijuana grows.\\xa0 I know specifically with respect to Maine, that DEA and the FBI are working with the IRS and the Department of Homeland Security, as well as local law enforcement, to investigate those illegal grows.\\xa0 I also know that the U.S. Attorney in Maine has made this a priority for her office.\\xa0 In most cases, I recommend talking to the Office of Legislative Affairs, but I know you are very well synced up with U.S. Attorney's Office there, and they obviously have more very specific Maine information.\\xa0 But I don't think anybody could take this more seriously than our U.S. Attorney there, and she is able to harness the resources of all of our agencies.\\xa0 Not only our own, but also Department of Homeland Security and IRS.  Senator Collins continued: Do you have a theory on why the Chinese are sending people illegally into our country to establish these grow operations?\\xa0 As you point out, it's not just Maine, I believe Oklahoma, for example, has had a problem as well. Attorney General Garland:  I don't have a theory now.\\xa0 Normally, I develop a theory by learning the facts from the different investigative entities that look into this.\\xa0 So, at this point, I don't have a theory.\\xa0 There are a lot of obvious theories, including the profit motive, and these transnational criminal organizations are operating--the reason we call them transnationals is they are operating all over the world to make money where they can.\\xa0 But I can't tell you what the specific motivation here is. +++ Senator Collins has long led efforts to crack down on the illicit Chinese marijuana growing operations in Maine.\\xa0 In response to concerns raised by constituents in 2022, Senator Collins sent a letter to the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency (MDEA) Director sharing relevant information and asking the MDEA to take appropriate actions “consistent with applicable laws, rules, and regulations.”\\xa0 Since then, Senator Collins and the Maine Delegation sent letters to Attorney General Garland in August 2023 and January 2024.\\xa0 In the fall of 2023, Senator Collins received a briefing from the U.S. DEA Administrator on the agency’s efforts.\\xa0 Earlier this year, Senator Collins signed joined a bipartisan, bicameral letter to Attorney General Garland requesting a briefing on the DOJ’s efforts to address illicit Chinese marijuana growing operations.\\xa0 At the annual worldwide threats open hearing of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence last month, Senator Collins questioned FBI Director Christopher Wray on the FBI’s efforts to support state, local, and county officials in combating illegal marijuana growing operations. ###\",\n",

       " '[HARTFORD, CT] – U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) joined Senate colleagues in introducing legislation to prevent youth suicide, which is the second leading cause of death for people aged 10 to 24. The\\xa0Child Suicide Prevention and Lethal Means Safety Act\\xa0would fund suicide prevention initiatives, ensure health care providers receive training to prevent intentional harm, and create a centralized hub to provide safety information to at-risk youth and their support networks. “Across the country we are seeing a trend of increasing suicide rates that are beyond disturbing and gut-wrenching. We know we can do something. That’s why I’ve introduced the\\xa0Child Suicide Prevention and Lethal Means Safety Act\\xa0to support care and counseling wherever children can be reached – in the schools, in the doctor’s office, in emergency departments,”\\xa0said Blumenthal on Monday\\xa0at a press conference at The Village for Families and Children\\xa0in Hartford. “Fighting this crisis is\\xa0critical. With federal funding and support, it must happen.” Suicide rates among young Americans increased by 52 percent between 2000 and 2021 according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). A June 2021 CDC report found a significant increase in emergency department visits for suicide attempts among adolescents aged 12-17 during the pandemic, including a spike of more than 50 percent among adolescent girls. In Connecticut, between January 2016 and September 2022, 48 Connecticut children ages 10 to 17 died by suicide.\\xa0 The age of children dying by suicide in Connecticut is getting younger and younger, according to the Office of the Child Advocate. A critical opportunity to identify young people at risk is in health care settings, but many health care professionals lack the training or resources to do so. This bill prepares health care professionals to identify and respond to warning signs by training them in evidence-based suicide prevention practices like lethal means safety, a practice limiting access to objects that can be used for self-directed violence, and providing funding to connect at-risk patients with crisis resources. Specifically, the\\xa0 Blumenthal has championed initiatives to expand access to mental health care for young people. This year’s government funding bill, which Blumenthal supported, included $104 million for the Youth Mentoring Grant Program, $98.9 million for the National Child Traumatic Stress Initiative, $135 million for STOP School Violence Act programs, and $160 million to the Department of Education to address the shortage of school-based mental health professionals across K-12 schools. The\\xa0Child Suicide Prevention and Lethal Means Safety Act\\xa0is led by Senators Brian Schatz (D-HI) and Tim Kaine (D-VA), and cosponsored by U.S. Senators Blumenthal, Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Ron Wyden (D-OR), and Laphonza Butler (D-CA). Companion legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives by U.S. Representatives Lauren Underwood (D-IL-14) and Kim Schrier (D-WA-8). The\\xa0Child Suicide Prevention and Lethal Means Safety Act\\xa0is supported by more than 30 organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Psychological Association, American Public Health Association, American Hospital Association, American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, American Academy of Family Physicians, Federation of American Hospitals, Ann & Robert H.

The form of their arrival will be political ads, and other forms of disinformation that are made possible by artificial intelligence,”\\xa0said Blumenthal.\\xa0“There is a clear and present danger to our democracy. This world of disinformation doesn’t have to be our future. We have agency, we can take action. And we are here today not only to hear about the dangers, but also to look forward to action that we can take in the United States Congress.” This hearing comes after deepfakes were used to impersonate President Biden to discourage voters from participating in the New Hampshire presidential primary in January. “Artificial intelligence is already being used to interfere with our elections, sowing lies about candidates and suppressing the vote. We already have a chilling example.\\xa0This January, thousands of New Hampshire residents received a call impersonating President Biden, telling them not to vote—not to vote—in the state’s primary,”\\xa0said Blumenthal.\\xa0“Between the ease of use, and the increasing interest from foreign adversaries and domestic political interests, our democracy is facing a perfect storm.” To show how realistic deepfakes are, Blumenthal ran an experiment in which he and his colleagues were asked to determine which recording of his voice was AI-generated. Ben Colman, CEO and Co-Founder of Reality Defender and a witness at the hearing, helped organize the experiment and revealed that although Blumenthal had earlier recorded the same lines that were read during the hearing, the audio that they played were all deepfakes. “And as you guys think about which ones are real and fake, we’re going to share with you the surprise that they’re actually all fake. The challenge and the opportunity is that anybody with a Google search and internet connection can make something as entertaining or as dangerous as they can imagine,”\\xa0said Colman. Video of Blumenthal’s opening remarks can be\\xa0found here, and video of the deepfake experiment can be\\xa0found here. Transcript of Blumenthal’s opening remarks can be found below. We are here today at this Subcommittee meeting because a deluge of deception, disinformation, and deepfakes are about to descend on the American public. The form of their arrival will be political ads, and other forms of disinformation that are made possible by artificial intelligence. There is a clear and present danger to our democracy. This world of disinformation doesn’t have to be our future. We have agency, we can take action. And we are here today not only to hear about the dangers, but also to look forward to action that we can take in the United States Congress. But we should make no mistake—the threat of political deepfakes is real, it’s happening now, it’s not science fiction coming at some point in the future, possibly or hypothetically.\\xa0Artificial intelligence is already being used to interfere with our elections, sowing lies about candidates and suppressing the vote. We already have a chilling example. This January, thousands of New Hampshire residents received a call impersonating President Biden, telling them not to vote—not to vote—in the state’s primary.\\xa0It is important for the American people to hear exactly what was said. [New Hampshire Biden deepfake call]\\xa0What a bunch of malarkey. You know the value of voting democratic when our votes count. It’s important that you save your vote for the November election. We’ll need your help in electing Democrats up and down the picket. Voting this Tuesday only enables the Republicans in their quest to elect Donald Trump again. Your vote makes a difference in November, not this Tuesday. If you would like to be removed from future calls, please press 2 now. It's important for the American people to hear what impersonation and deepfakes look like. It’s also important to know that that’s what suppression of voter turnout looks like. The deepfake of President Biden wasn’t made by a computer whizz, or some computer science graduate student, or anybody with any particular skill. It was made by a street magician, whose previous claim to fame was that he has world records in spoon bending and escaping straightjackets. The voice cloning technologies used in that call were inconceivable just a few years ago. Now, they are free, online. Available to everyone. And it’s not just voice cloning. Deepfake images and videos are disturbingly easy for anyone to create.\\xa0 Protecting our elections isn’t about Democrats versus Republican. Already, deepfakes have targeted candidates from across the political spectrum, and no one, literally no candidate, no voter, no one, is safe from them. And if a street magician can cause this much trouble, imagine what Vladimir Putin or China can do. In fact, they’re doing it. National security officials and law enforcement have been shouting from the rooftops, as well as in our classified briefings, their fears about AI and foreign disinformation. It’s happening. It’s here. Earlier this month, Microsoft revealed that social media accounts linked to the Chinese Communist Party were using AI to meddle in American politics. China has been caught using deepfakes to impersonate Americans to sow division and conspiracies theories—such as deepfake images to push the lie that the United States military caused wildfires in Hawaii. Between the ease of use, and the increasing interest from foreign adversaries and domestic political interests, our democracy is facing a perfect storm. When the American people can no longer recognize fact from fiction, quite literally, it will be impossible to have a democracy. As we discussed in our last hearing, these deepfakes and rampant disinformation are also happening at time when local journalism is hanging by a thread. Deepfakes have targeted not only Presidential candidates, but also Senate campaigns, and local elections, like the recent Chicago mayoral election. Anyone can do it—even in the tiniest race. In some ways, local elections present an even bigger risk. A deepfake of President Biden will attract national attention. It will be publicized as disinformation and deception. But deepfakes on a local election, state legislative contest, or city council—probably not.\\xa0And, when a local newspaper is closed or understaffed, there may be no one doing fact-checking. No one to issue those Pinocchio images. And no one to correct the record. That’s a recipe for toxic and destructive politics. Congress has the power—indeed the obligation—to stop this AI nightmare. There are common sense, bipartisan bills ready-to-go right now. I’m supporting them, a number of my colleagues have offered and supported them as well. Senators Klobuchar and Hawley’s legislation to prohibit deceptive political deepfakes, the Protect Elections from Deceptive AI Act. Requiring consent and watermarks for deepfakes, such as Senator Coons and Senator Blackburn’s, called the NO FAKES Act. On Section 230, Senator Hawley and I have a bill to ensure that there’s no question that Section 230 does not apply to AI, we can hold social media companies and Big Tech accountable for election deepfakes and other AI-driven harms.\\xa0\\xa0 If we leave them unchecked, deepfakes and political deceptions will sow the seeds of our destruction as a democracy. It may sound like an exaggeration, but it is dangerously true. And so, this world of disinformation and poisonous lies doesn’t have to be our future. Today, we need to begin to continue the process of making sure it isn’t our future. And with that, I’ll turn to the Ranking Member. -30-\\xa0\",\n",
       " 'Ruling guarantees veterans’ access to GI Bill benefits under the Post-9/11 Program [HARTFORD, CT] – Today, Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) celebrated the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in\\xa0Rudisill v. McDonough, Secretary of Veteran Affairs. The Court\\xa0ruled 7-2 in favor of James Rudisill\\xa0and held that veterans who served multiple tours have the right to access all educational benefits that they are entitled to under the Post-9/11 GI Bill and the Montgomery GI Bill. The ruling follows an amicus brief led by Congresswoman Jennifer McClellan (VA-04) and Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA) and joined by Senator Blumenthal and 13 of his colleagues in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. “This landmark decision will be life-changing for thousands of post and pre-9/11 veterans. The Supreme Court ruling guarantees that James Rudisill and other veterans of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq will have full access to the educational benefits they earned when they volunteered to go to war,”\\xa0said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT).\\xa0“We have a sacred obligation to care for those who bore the battle when they return home and this decision reaffirms that promise.” “James Rudisill represents the very best of our Commonwealth and served our country with honor and distinction. I am thrilled the Supreme Court ruled in his favor and upheld his right to access the benefits he was promised and rightfully deserves,”\\xa0said Rep. McClellan.\\xa0“This ruling is a win for Mr. Rudisill and the more than 1.7 million veterans eligible for both the Montgomery GI Bill and the Post-9/11 GI Bill. I was honored to join Senator Kaine in leading an amicus brief to the Court. I will always fight to ensure our servicemembers and veterans have access to the resources they need.” “Our veterans sacrificed so much to keep our country safe, and we owe it to them to keep our word and administer the benefits they were promised in return,”\\xa0said Sen. Kaine.\\xa0“I commend today’s Supreme Court decision in favor of Virginia veteran James Rudisill, who was denied the full benefits he earned under the G.I. bill. I am proud to have led a bipartisan, bicameral group of my colleagues in submitting an amicus brief in support of Mr. Rudisill’s case and will continue to do all I can through my work on the Senate Armed Services Committee to advocate for servicemembers, veterans and their families.” FBI Special Agent Rudisill is a Richmond, VA resident, who served in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan during three periods of active-duty military service: 2000 to 2002 as an enlisted member and 2007 to 2011 as a commissioned officer. After completing his first tour, Rudisill applied for – and received – education benefits under the Montgomery GI Bill to complete his undergraduate degree. Following his subsequent periods of service, Rudisill applied for additional education benefits through the post-9/11 GI Bill in order to attend divinity school and return to the Army as a minister. The Department of Veterans Affairs unfairly denied him the benefits he was promised, and Rudisill forfeited his offer to divinity school as a result. In August, Senator Blumenthal supported a bipartisan, bicameral group of lawmakers, led by Congresswoman McClellan and Senator Kaine, to\\xa0submit an amicus brief\\xa0to the Supreme Court in support of Rudisill. In the House, Reps. Jennifer McClellan, Gerry Connolly (VA-11), Adriano Espaillat (NY-13), Raúl Grijalva (AZ-07), Henry C. “Hank” Johnson (GA-04), Stephen Lynch (MA-08), Grace Meng (NY-06), Robert C. “Bobby” Scott (VA-03), Abigail Spanberger (VA-07), Glenn “GT” Thompson (PA-15), Jennifer Wexton (VA-10), and Robert Wittman (VA-01) joined the brief.

       " \"“Boeing is at a moment of reckoning. It’s a moment many years in the making.” [WASHINGTON, DC] – Today, U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal, Chair of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), delivered opening remarks at a hearing titled “Examining Boeing’s Broken Safety Culture: Firsthand Accounts.” The hearing—featuring testimony from Sam Salehpour, a current quality engineer at Boeing, and other witnesses—examined firsthand accounts of alarming manufacturing deficiencies and the company’s broken safety culture. “Our purpose today is to hear from whistleblowers who have personal, eyewitness, factual stories to tell about Boeing putting profits ahead of safety, putting stock price ahead of quality, production speed ahead of responsibility,”\\xa0said Blumenthal. Emphasizing mounting whistleblower allegations, Blumenthal described Salehpour’s claims of a culture of retaliation at the company, “These whistleblowers have come forward at great personal risk. In fact, a number of them and others have suffered harassment, isolation, transfers, and even threats of physical violence. Just as an example, this tire was in a car that belonged to Mr. Salehpour. He will testify about the circumstances that led to, in effect, a bolt being driven into a tire on his car, which posed not only a symbolic message to him but also a personal risk to his safety.” Blumenthal underscored the need for a shift in Boeing’s culture to prioritize safety,\\xa0“To create a genuine and comprehensive culture of safety, Boeing must create workplace conditions where everyone feels comfortable reporting quality and safety concerns, even in situations where concerns turn out to be unfounded.\\xa0Even where the complaints are mistaken, Boeing’s culture must be one where employees are encouraged to speak up.” “Boeing’s workers remain as skilled and talented as ever, and I would be remiss if I did not recognize that many of these workers are represented by unions, like the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers and The Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace, and they have helped to protect a number of their employees against retaliation and reprisal,”\\xa0Blumenthal concluded. During the hearing, Blumenthal also entered into the record written testimony from two former Boeing employees, a\\xa0quality manager\\xa0and a\\xa0mechanic\\xa0who each wrote to the committee about their safety concerns while working on 787s at Boeing’s South Carolina facility.\\xa0 These allegations included claims that the company discouraged employees from raising concerns about the safety of Boeing’s 787 airplanes. Video of Blumenthal’s opening remarks can be\\xa0found here. The full transcript of Blumenthal’s opening remarks can be found below. We welcome everyone here. We have a tight timeframe because of other proceedings in the Senate. I want to thank the witnesses for being here and their cooperation. And I thank the Ranking Member for his cooperation and other members of the Committee who are here today. Our purpose today is to hear\\xa0from whistleblowers who have personal, eyewitness, factual stories to tell about Boeing putting profits ahead of safety, putting stock price ahead of quality, production speed ahead of responsibility. This story is serious, even shocking.\\xa0The kinds of evidence that we will hear today is fact-based, science-based testimony that the public deserves to hear, and it is part of a continuing series of hearings that we will have based on what these whistleblowers will tell us and evidence that we obtain from\\xa0documents from a variety of sources. There are mounting serious allegations that Boeing has a broken safety culture and a set of practices that are unacceptable. These whistleblowers have come forward at great personal risk. In fact, a number of them and others have suffered harassment,\\xa0isolation, transfers, and even threats of physical violence. Just as an example, this tire was in a car that belonged to Mr. Salehpour. He will testify about the circumstances that led to, in effect, a bolt being driven into a tire on his car, which posed not only a symbolic message to him but also a personal risk to\\xa0his safety. It is simply one example of retaliation and reprisals and threats that he endured. Boeing is at a moment of reckoning. It’s a moment many years in the making. It is a moment that results not from one incident or one flight or one plane or one plan. It reached the public consciousness after the death of 346 people.\\xa0346 innocent travelers in 2018 and 2019, that led Boeing to promise that it would overhaul its safety practices and culture. That promise proved empty. We know it was empty because of incidents that have occurred since then, most recently the Alaska Airlines panel blowout. And we know it was empty because\\xa0the FAA itself audited Boeing's production and manufacturing, and in March, concluded, “noncompliance issue in Boeing's manufacturing process, control, parts handling, and storage, and product control,” were prevalent. I want to welcome particularly Sam Salehpour, who came to us because of the gravity of his concerns and because of what\\xa0happened to him when he tried to raise these concerns to Boeing's management. Not once, twice, but consistently and constantly over a period of years. And as a result, he was isolated, transferred, even threatened, for refusing to stay silent. What Boeing did was, in effect, try to silence him, conceal and cover up the facts that he was trying to bring to their attention about basic defects in manufacturing, the failure to properly fuse fuselage parts, the kind of concerns that led to the blow out of that panel on the Alaska Airlines flight. In the wake of the 737 MAX crashes, many current and former Boeing and FAA officials, like Ed Pierson and Joe Jacobsen, both of whom are with us today,\\xa0came forward to raise those kinds of concerns about safety culture at Boeing. And tragically, last month, John Barnett, a former Boeing quality control manager in South Carolina who became a whistleblower, committed suicide after alleging that managers had been pressuring workers not to document defects and properly address safety risks. Since this hearing was announced, our Subcommittee has received outreach from other individuals affiliated with Boeing who have contacted us to voice their concerns. For example, a former Boeing South Carolina manager wrote to us with examples of what he described as, “culture of shortcuts, pressure, and hostility,” that he experienced while working at Boeing between 2009 and 2020.\\xa0Another Boeing mechanic, who asked to remain anonymous, wrote to us and said, “The Boeing South Carolina plant was run by a good old boy network that played by their own rules. When we raised concerns that the work was not in accordance with the process and procedures, we were ordered to just do it and told there were hundreds of others waiting in line outside the gate wanting our jobs.” I am going to ask without objection that these two letters be entered into the record. The outreach that we have received, important and serious contacts with substantive information, in just the last few days, suggests there may be others out there who live in fear, like Mr. Salehpour, like John Barnett. And they have witnessed the shortcuts or defects that could\\xa0lead to the next tragedy. And their coming forward may help prevent it. To Mr. Salehpour, to Mr. Pierson, to Mr. Jacobson, and others who have come forward and will come forward in the future, I just want to say thank you. Thank you for your courage. Thank you for speaking truth to power, in the best sense of that word. Thank you for facing down one of the most powerful companies in the world. We intend to uncover what has enabled the culture of safety disregard to exist, so that we can change it for good. To create a genuine and comprehensive culture of safety, Boeing must create workplace conditions where everyone feels\\xa0comfortable reporting quality and safety concerns, even in situations where concerns turn out to be unfounded. Even where the complaints are mistaken. Boeing’s culture must be one where employees are encouraged to speak up. Boeing is fortunate to have one of the most skilled, competent,\\xa0honest, dedicated workforces in the world. The United States is fortunate to have them working at Boeing. They deserve to be rewarded, not punished, for doing their job properly and speaking up when it is appropriate. Fortunately for Boeing and for passengers around the world, this moment of reckoning and the changes that must follow can still happen before any more\\xa0lives are lost. Our Committee has initiated a bipartisan inquiry. We expect both Boeing and the FAA to fully cooperate and appear before our Committee. Today’s hearing, as I mentioned earlier, is the first of several we intend to hold to get to the bottom of Boeing's broken safety culture. We expect Boeing’s CEO to appear before us to tell the American people why the promises made\\xa0five years ago by this company have not been fulfilled. I do not want anyone to mistake our objectives here. Our goal is not to drive Boeing to fail. In fact, just the opposite. We want and need Boeing to succeed. It is a company that once was preeminent in engineering and safety. We want to restore the luster of\\xa0that reputation and its business, which have been so sadly battered. Boeing’s workers remain as skilled and talented as ever, and I would be remiss if I did not recognize that many of these workers are represented by unions, like the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers and The Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace, and they have helped to protect a number of their employees against retaliation and reprisal. We want Boeing to learn from its mistakes and be accountable. We want the Department of Justice to take this evidence and other facts that it has obtained to examine the deferred prosecution agreement, whether conditions of that agreement have been violated, whether criminal prosecution is appropriate. I am not jumping to conclusions. I am a former prosecutor.\\xa0I know that investigations have to proceed carefully and methodically. But these investigations are important to accountability. Again, thank you to the witnesses for being here today, and I turn now to the Ranking Member. -30-\\xa0\",\n",
       " '[WASHINGTON, D.C.] – Today, U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS) introduced legislation to correct unfair and costly rates set by natural gas pipeline companies. The\\xa0Making Pipelines Accountable to Consumers and Taxpayers (MPACT) Act\\xa0closes a loophole that has allowed natural gas pipeline companies to consistently overcharge consumers. The legislation provides for millions of dollars in refunds to consumers and would also help reduce future excessive energy rates. “We must close a legal loophole that natural gas pipeline companies have used routinely and reprehensibly to exploit consumers. The companies overcharge consumers who are unable to receive full reimbursements under current law. This is a matter of simple fairness: if consumers are overcharged for a utility, they should be made whole. With the\\xa0Making Pipelines Accountable to Consumers and Taxpayers Act, we can hold natural gas pipeline operators accountable for stealing money out of consumers’ pockets and ensure that those consumers are paying only the correct, reasonable rate,” said Blumenthal. “This legislation is a matter of basic fairness to consumers in Mississippi and elsewhere, whether they use natural gas to cook meals or heat a poultry house.\\xa0 Right now they have no recourse or chance for a refund when an interstate natural gas pipeline makes millions of dollars in overcharges,”\\xa0Hyde-Smith said.\\xa0 “We need this legislation to close this loophole and ensure natural gas pipeline regulations are transparent for the American people.” The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulates rates charged by natural gas pipeline companies, but they lack the authority under the Natural Gas Act (NGA) to require interstate natural gas pipelines to pay refunds if consumers are overcharged. While FERC can order natural gas pipeline companies to lower their rates, it is unable to order the pipeline to refund any overcharges to its customers under current law. The\\xa0MPACT Act\\xa0would remedy this problem by holding natural gas pipeline operators accountable to their ratepayers and increase transparency around FERC’s regulation of natural gas pipelines. The\\xa0MPACT\\xa0Act\\xa0is endorsed by a number of organizations, including the National Gas Supply Association (NGSA), American Public Gas Association (APGA), Industrial Energy Consumers of America (IECA), American Forest and Paper Association (AFPA), American Public Power Association (APPA), Cargill, Inc.,\\xa0Connecticut Natural Gas (CNG), Council of Industrial Boiler Owners (CIBO), Essential Minerals Association (EMA), Glass Packaging Institute (GPI), Process Gas Consumers Group (PGC), Maine Natural Gas (MNG), and New York State Electric and Gas (NYSEG). “We applaud Senator Blumenthal for introducing this important legislation, which will provide natural gas customers with timely and meaningful relief from excessive pipeline earnings,”\\xa0said Dena Wiggins, President and CEO of NGSA. \"The American Public Gas Association (APGA) commends Senator Richard Blumenthal and Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith for their effort to reintroduce the\\xa0Making Pipelines Accountable to Consumers and Taxpayers Act\\xa0(MPACT). If enacted, this bill will help keep rates affordable for Americans using energy in their homes and businesses. The millions of gas consumers across the country deserve the same protections afforded to electric consumers when interstate transmission entities charge excessive rates. This legislation is critical to continue the efforts of public gas utilities to deliver affordable, reliable, and efficient energy to their customers in 38 states. APGA urges Congress to swiftly pass the\\xa0MPACT Act,”\\xa0said Dave Schryver, President and CEO of APGA. “We strongly support this legislation,”\\xa0said Paul Cicio, President and CEO of IECA.\\xa0“Natural gas consumers are subjected to billions of dollars in overcharges from interstate pipelines each year.

       " '[HARTFORD, CT] – U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy today applauded Senate passage of a resolution they introduced honoring the late U.S. Senator Joseph Lieberman. “Joe Lieberman was a monumental figure in Connecticut and national politics and I will always remember him for his unwavering values and willingness to bridge divides. He was ferociously independent and deeply strong willed, but also eager to listen, understand and learn from others. Joe’s story ended too soon, but his legacy is large and lasting,”\\xa0Blumenthal said.\\xa0\\xa0 “Few people left a bigger mark on this world than Joe Lieberman. The history books will remember him for his work to combat climate change, fight for gay rights, and protect the homeland, along with his groundbreaking role as the first Jewish nominee for national office. But I will remember most working with him day in and day out to bring federal dollars back to Connecticut and fighting for policies that made our state stronger. Joe refused to be defined by his party, he led with decency and character, and he conveyed an unbridled enthusiasm for public service. He was one of one, and Connecticut was lucky to have him,”\\xa0said Murphy. Lieberman was born in Stamford, Connecticut in 1942 and graduated from Yale University in 1964 and Yale Law School in 1967. Lieberman was elected Attorney General of the State of Connecticut in 1982, where he led efforts to set higher standards of legal assistance to state agencies and implement a focus on constituent services that continues to this day. During his tenure as Attorney General, Lieberman fought to expand and enforce consumer and environmental protections—efforts he continued to build on once elected to the United States Senate in 1988. Lieberman served as U.S. Senator for Connecticut from 1988 to 2012 and played a key role in creating the Department of Homeland Security and establishing the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States following September 11, 2001. While serving in the Senate, Lieberman was a strong advocate for civil rights and led efforts to repeal the “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” policy of the U.S. Armed Forces. He also led passage of the Clean Air Act of 1990, promoted legislation to warn consumers about the dangers of pesticides and was an early supporter of efforts to combat climate change. In 2000, Lieberman made history as the first Jewish major party nominee for the position of Vice President as Al Gore’s running mate. After leaving public office, Lieberman continued his work in national security and civil rights through organizations such as the Muslim-Jewish Advisory Council and the Counter Extremism Project.

       " 'April 19, 2024 Amendments to Drastically Increase Humanitarian Assistance, Impose One-Year Moratorium on Offensive Weapons Transfers to IDF WASHINGTON\\xa0– Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) filed an amendment to increase funding to global humanitarian assistance and an amendment to place a one-year moratorium on the transfer of offensive weapons to the Israeli military. “We find ourselves at a critical inflection point and every action taken by policymakers in this moment must be in pursuit of peace, de-escalation, and saving lives,” said Congresswoman Pressley. “Our amendments would help deliver desperately needed humanitarian assistance and stop the flow of offensive weapons that have been used by the Israeli military to kill Palestinians en masse.” The first amendment filed by Rep. Pressley would drastically increase the amount of humanitarian aid in the bill from $9.1 billion to $26.4 billion. This humanitarian aid would be used to address the worsening crises in Gaza and Ukraine, as well as in Haiti, Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan, and others. The second amendment filed would prevent the United States from sending offensive weapons to the Israeli military for one year. The amendment would allow the United States to continue providing missile defense systems to Israel, including the Iron Dome. The amendment comes amidst rising tensions in the Middle East, over 34,000 Palestinians killed in Gaza, 1,200 Israelis killed in Hamas’s horrific October attack, more than 100 hostages still held captive by Hamas, and millions of Gazans on the brink of famine.\\xa0\\xa0 Since the horrific October 7th attack, Congresswoman Pressley has consistently and stridently called for a ceasefire to save lives, return all hostages, and surge humanitarian aid to Gaza. This week, Rep. Pressley delivered a floor speech in which she called or urgent de-escalation in the Middle East and renewed her calls for a ceasefire in Gaza to prevent a broader regional war. As Co-Chair of the House Haiti Caucus, Rep. Pressley has also led calls for extending Temporary Protected Status for Haiti, a halt to deportations, a Haitian-led democratic transition, the delivery of humanitarian, economic and security assistance to the island, and more. Throughout the Israel and Hamas conflict, Rep. Pressley has been a vocal and consistent advocate of diplomacy, de-escalation, and saving lives. ### Washington DC Office 402 Cannon HOB\\r\\nWashington, DC 20515 Phone (202) 225-5111\\r\\nFax (202) 225-9322 District Office 1295 River Street\\r\\nHyde Park, MA 02136 Phone (617) 850-0040\\r\\nFax (202) 225-9322',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON\\xa0– Today, the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs held a markup on the bipartisan Caring for Survivors Act of 2023. The legislation passed out of Subcommittee by voice vote. This legislation is led by Congresswoman Jahana Hayes (CT-05) and Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-01) in the House, and Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Jon Tester (D-Mont)\\xa0and Senator John Boozman (R-Ark) in the Senate. The Caring for Survivors Act would bring survivor benefits in line with other federal benefits and ensure surviving families get the benefits their loved ones earned. “I am committed to honoring our service members, veterans, and the survivors they have left behind,” said Congresswoman Hayes. “The outdated policies surrounding Dependency and Indemnity Compensation have created unbearable stress for surviving families. The Caring for Survivors Act increases those benefits, reduces barriers to access, and lessens the financial burden placed on veterans, service members, and their families. I am pleased this bill passed out of the Subcommittee today and look forward to action by the full committee. A full committee markup on this bill will allow it to be brought to the House floor for a vote. This issue is too important and we must pursue every opportunity to make this necessary change.”\\xa0 On April 10, 2024, Congresswoman Hayes testified before the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs highlighting how the Caring for Survivors Act aims to correct administrative barriers that block surviving families from the benefits their loved one earned. Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) is a tax-free monthly benefit paid to eligible survivors of military Servicemembers who died in the line of duty or eligible survivors of Veterans whose death resulted from a service-related injury or disease. To qualify for this benefit, the claimant(s) must be the eligible surviving family member (spouse, child, parent) of a military Servicemember or Veteran who:\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 DIC benefits rates were set in 1993 and have been minimally adjusted since then. The DIC also has rules that can drastically decrease the benefits to survivors if they remarry or if the period of disability before death was less than 10 years. Other federal survivor programs do not have such stringent rules for decreasing or withholding survivor benefits.  This bill matches DIC benefits to benefits in other federal survivor programs: The Caring for Survivors Act has the support of the following organizations: Tragedy Assistance for Survivors (TAPS), Gold Star Wives (GSW), Military Officers Association (MOAA), Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA), Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), Disabled American Veterans (DAV), National Military Family Association (NMFA). \\xa0 \\xa0 Permalink: https://hayes.house.gov/2024/4/house-veterans-affairs-subcommittee-advances-hayes-bill-to-expand-benefits-for-surviving-veteran-families',\n",

On February 13, 2024, the Senate passed bipartisan comprehensive national security legislation to help our allies in Ukraine, Israel, and the Indo-Pacific and send critical aid to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

We have the votes in the House to pass the bipartisan national security supplemental. This Senate passed bill can pass the House and be on the President’s desk within hours. It is a choice and a further delay tactic that Speaker Mike Johnson has not brought the Senate national security package to the House Floor.

I will exhaust every legislative option to get an aid bill passed. The one person standing in the way is Speaker Johnson.

       " 'Bipartisan Legislation Enhances All Crop Insurance Infrastructure, with a Focus on Specialty Crops Washington, D.C.— U.S. Representative Austin Scott (GA-08), Chairman of the House Agriculture General Farm Commodities, Risk Management, and Credit Subcommittee, Rep. Jimmy Panetta (CA-19) of the Ways & Means Committee, and Rep. Tracey Mann (KS-01), Chairman of the House Agriculture Livestock, Dairy, and Poultry Subcommittee, today introduced the Ensuring Access to Risk Management Act. The legislation corrects a current flaw that cuts risk management delivery funding for specialty crops whenever larger row crops experience higher commodity prices. The legislation also restores the annual inflation adjustment for risk management delivery funding for all crops. The flaw harming specialty crop risk management delivery has been a problem since 2011. The last general inflation adjustment for risk management delivery was in 2015. The FY2022 Agricultural Appropriations Bill included equitable relief for specialty crop risk management delivery for one year. Both the FY2022 and FY2023 Agricultural Appropriations Bills called on the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to provide permanent relief for specialty crop risk management delivery as well as the restoration of the general annual inflation adjustment for all crops, but USDA indicated that legislation is required. “As the Chairman of the Subcommittee with jurisdiction over Federal Crop Insurance, I’m pleased to introduce this legislation to ensure that the infrastructure delivering our farmers and ranchers their most important safety net is on solid ground,” said Rep. Scott. “Agriculture in my state and district is very diverse, and this legislation is designed to ensure that whatever our producers grow, they’re going to get the risk management help they need.” “The current design of our crop insurance system can hurt many specialty crop producers all across the country, including in California’s 19th Congressional District,” said Rep. Panetta.\\xa0 “Our bipartisan legislation would correct that flaw and provide improved risk management infrastructure when prices fluctuate. This commonsense step to improve this program will help strengthen our farms, the food that they produce, and the families that they support.” “The higher the risk, the higher fall, and the stronger the safety net you need to survive,” said Rep. Mann. “While the federal crop insurance program mitigates risk and helps strengthen that safety net, the program’s administrative and operating costs have not been adjusted for inflation since the 2015 reinsurance year. Since then, inflation hit a forty-year high, and America’s agricultural producers and crop insurance agents are feeling its weight. By establishing a minimum reimbursement rate for administrative and operating expenses and restoring the annual inflation adjustment, this legislation helps Congress further strengthen the agricultural safety net to give farmers, ranchers, and agricultural producers the certainty they deserve.” “A large, bipartisan majority of Congress has twice gone on record in support of the important policies our legislation today advances,” added Rep. Scott. “Reps. Panetta, Mann, and I look forward to working during the Farm Bill process to make these policies a reality for the benefit of the farm and ranch families we serve and for producers across the country.” \\xa0 The full text of the legislation can be found here. \\xa0# # # Permalink: https://austinscott.house.gov/2024/4/representatives-austin-scott-jimmy-panetta-and-tracey-mann-introduce-measure-to-strengthen-crop-insurance-infrastructure',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger yesterday presented Baron Braswell and Gwendolyn Martinez — the parents of Baron P. “Deuce” Braswell II — with the “Suzanne McDaniel Memorial Award for Public Awareness” for their work to prevent teen violence in Virginia through the “Baron P. ‘Deuce’ Braswell Run Against Teen Violence.” The Baron P. “Deuce” Braswell Run Against Teen Violence — now in its 19th year — honors the memory of Deuce, a Virginia teenager who was murdered in 2006 by a senseless act of teen violence. Created by Martinez and Braswell, the annual event unites families and teenagers to take a stand against violence in Spotsylvania, Fredericksburg, and the greater region. Each year, Baron and Gwen bring together students, parents, teachers, community leaders, elected officials at all levels, and the media to increase awareness, provide more resources, and prevent future loss. To honor their work, Spanberger joined the U.S. Congressional Crime Survivors and Justice Caucus in presenting Martinez and Braswell with this award, which recognizes those who use their voice to promote and bring about change to advance rights, awareness, and services for crime victims. Spanberger’s office nominated them for the award. Click here to watch the full video of Spanberger’s remarks, as well as the award presentation and comments from Martinez and Braswell. “I have the honor of recognizing that this award will go to Baron Braswell and Gwendolyn Martinez for the work that they do to bring attention to the issue of teen violence in our communities. In January of 2006, they lost their beloved son. He was a student athlete. He was an honorable student. Everyone that knew him loved him. He was a vibrant person,” said Spanberger during the ceremony. “After Deuce’s murder at a party, Gwen and Baron chose to make a change in our community — and they started an annual run, where community members are brought together in a beautiful, joyful, athletic event on a September morning in Virginia. We honor his life, people run a beautiful course, and — importantly — members of the community are educated on resources that are available related to preventing teen violence, related to joining in community with one another, and related to mental health and the challenges that face so many of our kids.” Spanberger continued, “They bring us all together in community to honor their son and remember their son. And there’s a scholarship — so that each year a kid from our region can go off to school and know that they are supported not just financially, but also in spirit. So many of our community members join together year after year to celebrate Deuce’s life and honor him — and I’m honored to present this award.” Click here for more information about the Baron P. “Deuce” Braswell Run Against Teen Violence. BACKGROUND The “Suzanne McDaniel Memorial Award for Public Awareness” honors Suzanne McDaniel, one of the first prosecutor-based victim advocates in Texas and in the country. McDaniel created Harris County’s first community interagency council on sexual assault and family violence and the first rape exam protocol for Houston Hospital and Medical Associations. She also formed the Texas Crime Victim Clearinghouse, the first statewide resource in the nation, and helped draft and pass the Texas Crime Victim Bill of Rights, the Texas Crime Victims’ Compensation Act, and the Texas Constitutional Amendment on Crime Victim Rights. McDaniel passed away in May 2012. The U.S. Congressional Crime Survivors and Justice Caucus focuses on elevating the voices of crime victims and survivors within the U.S. Congress in a bipartisan way. Spanberger has previously spoken at the Run Against Teen Violence to show solidarity with Deuce’s family, local leaders, law enforcement, students, and community members. ### Congresswoman: “We Have Too Much Work to Do to Waste Time on Petty Political Games” WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger today released the following statement after voting against U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene’s (R-GA-14) effort to throw the U.S. House of Representatives into chaos. “Since January 2023, this dysfunctional House Republican majority has […] The Common Ground Scorecard Ranked the Congresswoman as Tied for Fourth Place for Most Bipartisan Elected Official in the Country WASHINGTON, D.C. —\\xa0The nonpartisan Common Ground Committee (CGC) once again ranked U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger as the most bipartisan Member of Congress from Virginia — and gave her the fourth-highest score of any lawmakers in […] Since the Start of 2019, the Congresswoman’s Office Has Returned More Than $38 Million in Backlogged IRS Refunds, Social Security Checks, VA Benefits, & More WASHINGTON, D.C. —\\xa0U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger announced today that her office has now returned more than $38 million in federal casework funds to residents of Virginia’s Seventh District.

       " 'The “Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act” Would Establish New “Digital Skills at Work” Grant Program to Expand Digital Workforce Skills for Americans Seeking Employment or Upskilling Opportunities WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger (D-VA-07), U.S. Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA), and U.S. Representative David Valadao (R-CA-22) today introduced bipartisan, bicameral legislation to expand access to digital skills training for American job seekers. According to the National Skills Coalition and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, 92 percent of today’s jobs require digital skills. Nearly one third of workers do not have the foundational digital skills — such as email, spreadsheets, or data entry — to enter and succeed in today’s workforce. Americans who can qualify for jobs requiring at least one digital skill earn 23 percent more income on average annually. Despite high demand across industries, digital skills training is not currently listed as an allowable use under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), federal legislation enacted to help job seekers access employment, education, training, and support services to succeed in the labor market. Because of this lack of allowance, one-stop workforce development career centers — physical sites within local workforce development areas across the United States where job seekers and employers can access programs, services, and resources — do not offer any digital skills training opportunities. The bipartisan, bicameral Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act would amend WIOA to establish a new “Digital Skills at Work” grant program to expand digital skills training within postsecondary education, adult education, and workforce development systems. This legislation would make specific, targeted investments in digital skills training to help Americans seeking jobs or upskilling opportunities and Americans with barriers to employment learn or build digital skills. Additionally, this bill would advance access to good-paying jobs and support the development of digitally resilient education and workforce systems. “When we help job seekers learn and refine on-the-job skills, we are helping Americans advance their careers and helping businesses hold on to adept and experienced employees. This bipartisan, bicameral legislation would empower states, localities, and local organizations — that are already doing incredible work to support our local workforces — to assist Virginians and Americans across the country in learning and building the industry-specific digital skills that will help them succeed in our 21st century economy,” said Spanberger. “Investments to close the digital skills gap help our workforce and our communities stay competitive and stay ahead, and I’m grateful for the support of Senator Kaine and Congressman Valadao as we work to deliver this support.” “Digital skills can be a gateway to new job opportunities for so many Virginians, especially at a time when I’m hearing from employers across the Commonwealth about how hard they’re working to hire up,” said Kaine. “The Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act would make it easier for people to access high-quality digital training programs to develop or hone those skills. Investing in our workforce is good for our workers, employers, and overall economy, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join us in supporting this bill.” “Ensuring people have the digital skills they need to navigate the modern job market is critical to the strength of our economy,” said Valadao. “When people enter the workforce with the foundational skills they need, it not only eases the burden on employers, but it sets people on a path to success for the rest of their careers. I’m proud to join Rep. Spanberger in introducing this bipartisan legislation that will help better prepare our workforce and strengthen our economy.” The bipartisan, bicameral Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act is endorsed by a number of local Chambers of Commerce, workforce development boards, education systems, and national education and skills training organizations — including the Virginia Chamber of Commerce, Northern Virginia Chamber of Commerce, Prince William Chamber of Commerce, Fredericksburg Regional Chamber of Commerce, Northern Virginia Black Chamber of Commerce, Virginia Minority Chambers, Inc., Virginia Community College System, Bay Consortium Workforce Development Board, National Skills Coalition, Coalition on Adult Basic Education, Hispanic Federation, National Coalition for Literacy, National Digital Inclusion Alliance, NTEN, American Libraries Association, and Third Way. “Digital skills are essential for both employers and employees. As technology continues to evolve, businesses must equip their workforce with the necessary skills to adapt and excel. For the Commonwealth of Virginia and our nation, we must invest in digital skills training, including upskilling and reskilling, to empower them to stay competitive in a rapidly changing digital world,” said Barry DuVal, President & CEO, Virginia Chamber of Commerce “The Northern Virginia Chamber strongly endorses Congresswoman Spanberger and Senator Kaine’s Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act. In the 2023 Virginia General Assembly session the Northern Virginia Chamber was the leading advocate for the Youngkin Administration’s Workforce Consolidation effort. This legislation will build on that effort and ensure that Virginia and the nation’s workforce will have the digital skills needed to be productive in the 21st century economy,” said Julie Coons, President & CEO, Northern Virginia Chamber of Commerce. “Today 92% of jobs require digital skills and currently a third of American workers do not have access to training to participate in today’s economy. We applaud Congresswoman Spanberger, Congressman David Valadao (R-CA) and Senator Tim Kaine for working in a bipartisan fashion to create grant programs for states and localities to help close the gap on these critical skills for today’s workers. We look forward to continuing to work to ensure this legislation is enacted into law.” “The Prince William Chamber of Commerce fully supports upskilling the American workforce,” said Bob Sweeney, President & CEO, Prince William Chamber of Commerce. “The proposed legislation hits the right folks at the right time! It provides an opportunity for ALL to access the essential digital skills required in the high-demand, high-wage sectors like Data Centers, modern manufacturing and other technology jobs.” “The demand for the current digital workforce is high and will only grow in the future,” said Kevin Dillard, Chair of the Board of Directors, Fredericksburg Regional Chamber. “Providing this opportunity to continue to build upon the digital skills of the workforce of today and of the future is paramount.” “The Northern Virginia Black Chamber of Commerce is proud to support the Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act, spearheaded by Congresswoman Spanberger and Senator Kaine and supported by bipartisan leaders including Rep. Valadao. This groundbreaking legislation addresses an urgent need within our workforce, where the digital divide continues to be a barrier to employment, particularly for communities of color, low-income families, and rural populations,” said Samuel Wiggins, Board Chair, Northern Virginia Black Chamber of Commerce. “As a chamber, our mission is to advocate for economic empowerment and to provide opportunities that foster business growth and workforce development among Black entrepreneurs and professionals. By endorsing this bill, which establishes the ‘Digital Skills at Work’ grant program under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, we are helping to ensure that our members and their communities are not left behind in the rapidly evolving digital economy.\\xa0 The Northern Virginia Black Chamber of Commerce is committed to championing policies that tackle longstanding disparities and actively promote the economic development and success of our region and the entire country.” “Virginia Minority Chambers, Inc., fully endorses the upcoming Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act, introduced by Congresswoman Spanberger and Senator Kaine with bipartisan leaders like Rep. Valadao. This legislation addresses a pressing national issue—a digital skills gap affecting one-third of the US workforce—with a disproportionate impact on minority workers, low-income individuals, and rural residents due to historic underinvestment and structural inequities,” said Tonya Poindexter, Chief Operating Officer, Virginia Minority Chambers, Inc. “By establishing the ‘Digital Skills at Work’ grant program under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, the bill seeks to provide foundational digital skills necessary for success in today’s job market. Virginia Minority Chambers, Inc. appreciates the recognition of this critical need at the federal level and is committed to working with our federal and state partners to enhance both individual economic opportunities, especially in underserved communities, and the overall economic competitiveness of our nation. The passing of this bill is a vital step toward improving employment prospects across the country and ensuring our workforce is equipped to meet the demands of the digital age, particularly for those most affected by existing disparities.” “The introduction of Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act is a groundbreaking achievement for workforce stakeholders across the country. The bill supports National Skills Coalition research that finds that ninety-two percent of today’s jobs require digital skills, but only two thirds of workers have the foundational digital skills they need to succeed in today’s economy,” said Caroline Treschitta, Senior Government Affairs Manager, National Skills Coalition. “The bipartisan Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act addresses the digital skill divide by equipping workers and businesses with the digital training they need to ensure America remains competitive in the global economy.” Specifically, the Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act would: Click here for the full bill text. ### Congresswoman: “We Have Too Much Work to Do to Waste Time on Petty Political Games” WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger today released the following statement after voting against U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene’s (R-GA-14) effort to throw the U.S. House of Representatives into chaos. “Since January 2023, this dysfunctional House Republican majority has […] The Common Ground Scorecard Ranked the Congresswoman as Tied for Fourth Place for Most Bipartisan Elected Official in the Country WASHINGTON, D.C. —\\xa0The nonpartisan Common Ground Committee (CGC) once again ranked U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger as the most bipartisan Member of Congress from Virginia — and gave her the fourth-highest score of any lawmakers in […] Since the Start of 2019, the Congresswoman’s Office Has Returned More Than $38 Million in Backlogged IRS Refunds, Social Security Checks, VA Benefits, & More WASHINGTON, D.C. —\\xa0U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger announced today that her office has now returned more than $38 million in federal casework funds to residents of Virginia’s Seventh District.

       " ' View Video of Senator Rosen’s Questioning HERE WASHINGTON, DC – During a hearing of the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV) demanded that Postmaster General Louis DeJoy finally provide detailed information about the impact of his misguided proposal to downsize and relocate\\xa0mail processing operations from Reno to Sacramento, which would hurt Nevadans. Senator Rosen blasted Postmaster DeJoy for neglecting to listen to local Nevada leaders, businesses, and residents, and sounded the alarm on the negative impacts the plan will have on mail service reliability. Last week, Senator Rosen convened a meeting with USPS executives alongside Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) and Congressman Mark Amodei (R-NV-02) regarding the proposal where she denounced the lack of answers and transparency surrounding the decision to move mail processing to Sacramento, CA. She also recently sent a bipartisan letter expressing serious concern about the proposed relocation of mail processing in Reno. Additionally, Rosen joined a group of over 20 Senators in a letter urging Postmaster General Louis DeJoy to stop any changes or relocations to USPS processing facilities that would result in job losses and further degrade mail delivery performance, especially in rural states.\\xa0 Below is an excerpt from Senator Rosen’s questioning:\\xa0 Senator Rosen: I’m going to quote you [Inspector General] Hull, “every location has a story.” You just said that. So I’m going to talk about the story of Reno, Nevada, northern Nevada, Mr. DeJoy.\\xa0 I’m extremely concerned about your proposal to downsize the only postal processing and distribution center in northern Nevada, one of only two in my entire state. Your proposed plan includes transferring mail processing operations from Reno out of state to California, which will negatively impact mail delivery service for Nevadans. Under your proposal, if one of my constituents in Reno were to mail a birthday card to her mother who lives on the other side of town, the letter’s gonna be driven 130 miles over to Sacramento, California, and then sent 130 miles back to Nevada to reach its final destination.\\xa0 And so I’d like to understand what analysis you undertook to conclude that moving mail processing from Reno to Sacramento would actually benefit Nevadans. Your staff has continued to assert that your plan won’t undermine delivery standards for Nevada, but they haven’t been able to explain how this is possible or provide me [with] any of the data you’ve collected. And per what you just said, your team, they came and met with us, but they have not engaged with stakeholders in Nevada. I have talked to every one of our city councils. They have yet to receive data. And Senator Cortez Masto, myself, and Congressman Amodei didn’t receive it either.\\xa0 So I’d like to ask you a few yes or no questions, please, because my time is limited. Mr. DeJoy, the postal service standard for receiving and delivering mail in the Reno area is two days. The postal service is already failing to meet this standard with outbound mail and service in Reno currently averaging about four days. I point this out because in order to take local mail from Reno to Sacramento and back to Reno, as you propose, your trucks will need to go through the Donner Pass. I hope you’re familiar with that. It’s on 1-80. It’s the only way to get through Reno to Sacramento, which is subject to some of the most extreme weather conditions in the contiguous United States with over 33 feet of snow annually, 100 mile per hour winds, and treacherous conditions during wildfire season. So Mr. DeJoy, yes or no, do you happen to know how many days per year on average the Donner Pass is closed due to extreme weather conditions? Postmaster DeJoy: Why would I know that? Senator Rosen: Well, you’re the Postmaster General, and you’re saying that you’re going to go over this. So, let me tell you. There were 15 road closures for over 37 days of closures just last winter alone.\\xa0 So, yes or no, before you proposed your plan to move out of Reno, did you collect data on the potential impact to mail service from severe weather conditions on Donner Pass? Yes or no, please. Postmaster DeJoy: Yes. Within the organization… Senator Rosen: So can I have that data? Your team has refused to give that to us. We are the oversight committee. I believe that the United States Congress has a right to this information. Postmaster DeJoy: I will give you the data that we have. I’ll get with the team and send you the data that we have. Senator Rosen: Thank you. So, how do you plan to get the mail – maybe you want to tell us – how you plan to get the mail from Reno to Sacramento and back to Reno when there’s only one route – I say one route – I-80, to take that 260-mile round trip when it’s closed on an average of 37 days per year? Postmaster DeJoy: Let me start with the fact that […] we are investing significantly in Reno facilities and repurpose it for what we feel is the modern-day need for the postal service. The mail that we’re moving, only 10 percent of it… Senator Rosen: So you want to sacrifice 10 percent of my folks in rural Nevada. I have rural Nevadans, veterans, and seniors that still rely on this. That 10 percent, if you’re in the 10 percent, it’s everything. So a standard contingency plan here, Mr. DeJoy, is not going to work.\\xa0 The extreme conditions in Sierra Nevada mountains require you to undertake an extensive analysis to ensure all Nevadans, all Nevadans, even that 10 percent, get their mail on time. You don’t get to sacrifice those living in my rural areas or subject to harsher weather in the name of cost savings. The postal service has an obligation to deliver to everyone.\\xa0 Let me ask you this. Before developing this plan to downsize the Reno facility and transfer operations to California, did you analyze how your proposed plan would impact Nevada seniors, and can you provide me that data here today? Yes or no, please. Postmaster DeJoy: We have a process to analyze the movement of mail. Senator Rosen: Have you done one that would impact my Nevada seniors? Postmaster DeJoy: We treat every delivery point the same. Senator Rosen: Do you have one for Nevada seniors? So you didn’t look at how it would impact my seniors. That’s unacceptable. If you did, I expect to see that data as soon as possible and hopefully by the close of business today, please.\\xa0 I have to assume the reason I don’t have the data is because you instructed your staff not to provide it to me when we requested it last month. Postmaster DeJoy: I think that’s very inaccurate and presumptuous. Senator Rosen: It wasn’t provided to me when I asked for it last month, and it wasn’t provided when we asked for it last week. Postmaster General: I didn’t direct my staff to do anything with regard.\\xa0 Senator Rosen: Fair enough. Postmaster General: In fact, you’ve been briefed many times and your staff has been briefed many times. Senator Rosen: So what about the impact of your plan on Nevada’s veterans? We have over 225,000 veterans in Nevada. Yes or no, did you collect data on the impact to Nevada veterans? Postmaster DeJoy: Wherever the veterans live, it should have no impact… Senator Rosen: So, will you provide me that data? Will you provide me the data? Because if you didn’t have it…\\xa0 Postmaster DeJoy: We can provide our plan as to how the mail will be transported. Senator Rosen: So you didn’t specifically see how it would impact Nevada veterans. That’s actually unacceptable to me as well. Again, I asked for his information over a month ago. Postmaster DeJoy: If a veteran lives at a delivery point in Nevada… Senator Rosen: Nevada. It’s Nevada, sir. Please say it correctly. It’s Nevada. Postmaster DeJoy: If a veteran lives at a delivery point, our intention is to give them their mail in a timely service. Senator Rosen: You’re not giving them in [a] timely service now. So what makes you think it’s going to go in four days? I hope to see the data by the end of the day, please.\\xa0 Mr. DeJoy, an inspector general audit showed the postal service implemented the same changes to a data processing and distribution center in Virginia and service performance was not even included as a measure of success. So this time around, did you conduct any analysis on how your proposed changes would impact mail delivery service time specifically in northern Nevada? Yes or no, please. Postmaster DeJoy: Those are two separate operations and separate types of transactions. Senator Rosen: So I’m assuming it’s no. So you didn’t feel you had a due diligence to understand how Nevada senior citizens, veterans, small business owners, and rural communities who depend on the post office for their lives and livelihoods… Postmaster DeJoy: Senator, we intend to meet the service standards. Senator Rosen: You’re not meeting it now, and you have not [provided] us the data of what you made this assessment on. I hope to see that as quickly as possible. ###',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV) announced that two bipartisan bills she helped introduce to hold Iran’s regime accountable advanced out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The bipartisan Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad International Terrorism Support Prevention Act would sanction foreign entities and governments, like Iran, that support Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, or their affiliates. The bipartisan Stop Harboring Iranian Petroleum (SHIP) Act would sanction foreign ports and refineries that process Iranian oil in violation of U.S. sanctions as a way to stop Iran from using oil sales to fund its malign actions against the United States, Israel, and Arab partners in the Middle East.\\xa0 Regarding the Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad International Terrorism Support Prevention Act of 2024, Senator Rosen said: “On October 7, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorists brutally attacked, murdered, and kidnapped over 1,200 Israelis with the financial backing of Iran and other foreign networks. To ensure an attack like this never happens again, it’s critical that we cut off these terrorist groups’ sources of funding. That’s why I’m glad that our bipartisan bill to hold accountable anyone who provides material or financial support to these terrorist groups advanced out of committee.” Regarding the Stop Harboring Iranian Petroleum (SHIP) Act, Senator Rosen said: “As we saw in its attack on Israel over the weekend, the Iranian regime continues to threaten American interests and allies around the world. They must be held accountable and prevented from destabilizing the region. Iran relies on funding from illicit oil sales to finance its aggression, which is why I’m glad to see our bipartisan bill to crack down on those sales advance out of committee.” Senator Rosen has consistently worked across the aisle to stand up to protect U.S. national security and counter Iran’s actions. She called on the Biden Administration to refreeze $6 billion in Iranian assets held in Qatar following Hamas’ October 7th terrorist attack on Israel. Senator Rosen also stood up to her own party and voted in favor of several Republican amendments to the Authorization For Use of Military Force that would combat Iranian aggression and support Israel. She helped introduce the bipartisan Solidify Iran Sanctions Act to make permanent the Iran Sanctions of 1996 that would allow the President to impose sanctions on Iran’s energy sectors. The House of Representatives passed identical companion legislation to that bill last night in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote. ###',\n",
       " 'Nevada Senators Are Leading Opposition To The Proposal To Downsize And Relocate Mail Processing Operations From Reno To Sacramento WASHINGTON, DC – Today, U.S. Senators Jacky Rosen (D-NV) and Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) joined a bipartisan group of colleagues in both the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives in sending a letter to United States Postmaster General Louis DeJoy decrying the United States Postal Service’s (USPS) recent nationwide consolidation and review announcements that could severely diminish mail service reliability for postal networks across the country, including in northern Nevada. “A common theme of these announcements is the so-called ‘modernization’ of Processing and Distribution Centers (P&DCs) into Local Processing Centers (LPCs),” the Members wrote. “Taken together, these proposals dismantle parts of the Postal Service’s robust network that helps distribute mail across the country and places outgoing sorting into more distant facilities.\\xa0 The result of this change is that mail will need to travel farther from its origin to its sorting, creating inefficiencies in the system, especially for local mail.” “These consolidation proposals never have had any discernible support from local communities.\\xa0 On the contrary, we have heard strong opposition to these efforts from USPS customers, community leaders, local businesses, and postal employees,” the Members continued. “Rather than marching forward with these plans and offering short and vague statements dismissing concerns, the Postal Service should be communicating why the organization believes these changes are beneficial and what the specific impact of the changes will be to mail service.” “The Postal Service provides an essential service upon which our constituents rely.\\xa0 The robust nature of the Postal Service’s current network is its strength, not its weakness.\\xa0 To ensure that our constituents continue to receive reliable service, we urge you to reconsider these consolidation announcements,” the Members concluded. The full text of the letter can be found HERE. Senators Rosen and Cortez Masto have strongly opposed the proposed relocation of mail processing from Reno to Sacramento because of the impact it would have on mail service reliability and local jobs. During a Senate hearing yesterday, Senator Rosen blasted Postmaster General DeJoy on the proposed downsizing of the Reno mail processing facility. Both senators last week met with USPS officials regarding the proposal to express their deep concerns about the effects the plan would have on northern Nevada, including diminished mail service for seniors, veterans, and rural communities.. They also recently sent a bipartisan letter with Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV) expressing serious concern about the proposed relocation of mail processing in Reno.\\xa0 ###',\n",
       " 'Bill Would Create Program To Cover Costs Of Expunging or Sealing Cannabis Offenses In States Like Nevada Where Marijuana Has Been Legalized Or Decriminalized WASHINGTON, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV) introduced the Harnessing Opportunity by Pursuing Expungement (HOPE) Act to help expunge cannabis convictions in states where it has been legalized or decriminalized by establishing a new federal grant program to cover the costs of these expungements or sealing of records. The funding can be used to update record-keeping technology, automate the expungement process, support legal clinics that assist individuals through the expungement process, and to seal records of conviction for marijuana offenses.\\xa0 “While cannabis has been regulated in our state since 2017, many Nevadans are still dealing with the effects of past low-level marijuana offenses. Having a record for something that is now legal in our state threatens Nevadans’ ability to get a job, apply for housing, and contribute to our state’s economy,” said Senator Rosen. “That’s why I’m introducing this bipartisan bill to help expunge and seal certain marijuana convictions in states like Nevada where it has been legalized or decriminalized. I’ll continue working across the aisle to support commonsense cannabis reform that helps small businesses in our state.” “Removing the barriers caused by cannabis criminal records is one important step in addressing the harms caused by the Nation’s flawed and misguided cannabis criminalization laws,” said Riana Durrett, Director of the UNLV Cannabis Policy Institute. “The Cannabis Policy Institute is in support of legislation that seeks to expunge criminal records for low-level cannabis offenses and is thankful for Senator Rosen’s consistent championing of sensible cannabis legislation like the HOPE Act.” “The Nevada Cannabis Association strongly supports any legislation that seeks to remedy the harm created by low-level cannabis offenses,” said Layke Martin, Executive Director, Nevada Cannabis Association. “Senator Rosen’s HOPE Act of 2024 would go a long way towards removing the barriers to expungement in many states and, in Nevada, towards sealing cannabis records that might otherwise negatively impact Nevadans in a state where both medical and adult-use cannabis have been legal for many years. The NCA is thankful for Senator Rosen’s continued efforts at social justice reform, as well as her support of Nevada’s safe, regulated cannabis industry.” “As the Administration continues to review the federal classification of cannabis, we continue to call for more to be done on criminal justice reform that is outside the scope of the administrative scheduling process. The HOPE Act will do just that by allowing federal funds to be access by local and state governments that choose to move the ball forward in their own jurisdictions by expunging records of those charged with cannabis-related conduct that is now legal under their laws,” said Saphira Galoob, Executive Director of the National Cannabis Roundtable. “Only through expungements can barriers to employment, education, and housing be lifted, and with the majority of cannabis-related charges happening on the state and local level, the federal assistance the HOPE Act would provide can have a major impact on individual lives. We applaud the leadership of Senator Rosen in putting forward this bipartisan measure in the Senate to help right the wrongs of continued federal prohibition and the harm it has caused to communities across the country – many of which have now legalized cannabis – as we continue to work towards holistic federal cannabis policy reforms.” “The Harnessing Opportunities by Pursuing Expungement (HOPE) Act is a key piece of legislation that will provide states and localities the resources they need to implement automated expungement or record sealing processes for cannabis offenses,” said Anthony Lamorena, Senior Manager of Federal Affairs at the R Street Institute. “This bill provides a second chance for the millions of Americans who have cannabis arrests or convictions and restores their access to education, employment, housing, and other resources they need to remain law-abiding. Studies show that access to these life necessities provides the much-needed support to remain crime-free, which allows them to contribute to society and the economy. Our communities are safer and our economy is stronger when individuals no longer face the pervasive barriers of a criminal record. For these reasons, we at the R Street Institute are happy to endorse the HOPE Act, and we applaud Sen. Rosen (D-NV) on her bipartisan leadership to tackle this important issue.” Additionally, Senator Rosen’s HOPE Act is endorsed by NORML, Americans for Prosperity, and the Last Prisoner Project. Senator Rosen has been a strong advocate for cannabis reform in Congress. Last year, Senator Rosen helped introduce the bipartisan Secure and Fair Enforcement Regulation (SAFER) Banking Act to ensure that legal cannabis businesses have access to banking and insurance services. She also applauded the Department of Health and Human Services’ recommendation of easing marijuana restrictions, an important step towards rescheduling marijuana. Last Congress, Senator Rosen introduced the Fair Access for Cannabis Small Business Act to ensure that legally-operating cannabis small businesses have equal access to loans and programs provided by the Small Business Administration. ###',\n",
       " ' View Video of Senator Rosen’s Questioning HERE WASHINGTON, DC – During an oversight hearing of the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV) highlighted the importance of combating fentanyl smuggling at the southern border. In her questioning, she asked Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas about the advanced technology like high-tech scanners that are currently sitting unused in warehouses. Senator Rosen also highlighted the need to pass the bipartisan border security supplemental, which included funding for installing of these scanners. Senator Rosen has consistently worked across the aisle to secure the border and stop the flow of fentanyl. Earlier this month, Rosen voted to advance two bipartisan bills to improve U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) resources to better detect illicit drugs like fentanyl and other contraband smuggled across the U.S. southern border. Last month, her bipartisan END FENTANYL Act was signed into law, which will help crack down on drug smuggling by requiring the CBP Commissioner to update its drug interdiction guidance to ensure it is up to date. Senator Rosen has also called on the Biden administration to prioritize additional resources to stop the flow of illicit drugs like fentanyl through ports of entry along the border, pushed for increased resources to support border personnel, and voted to advance legislation to provide nearly $14 billion in funding to strengthen border security and humanely process migrants. Below is an excerpt from Senator Rosen’s opening remarks:\\xa0 In January, I did visit the Southern border again and spoke directly with federal law enforcement personnel about the work that they do to stop the flow of illicit drugs into our country and halting the flow of deadly substances like fentanyl.\\xa0 It’s one of my top priorities, your top priorities, I think it’s everybody’s top priority. And I’ve been proud to work across the aisle to pass commonsense, bipartisan legislation to keep our communities safe. And just last month, I’m proud to say President Biden signed into law the END FENTANYL Act, which I introduced with Senator Scott, on this committee, Rick Scott, and Senator Hassan. The new law is going to help us crack down on drug smuggling by requiring CBP to update its guidance for drug seizures at least once every three years and be sure it’s up to date on all our new substances. During my visit to the border, I was also able to see how CBP officers use tools – including advanced technology – to improve security at the border. However, I was extremely concerned to see a recent report of many of the high-tech scanners that we provided CBP officers to identify and stop the fentanyl.\\xa0 It’s coming in through vehicles, right. They’re sitting unused in warehouses. And that’s because Congress hasn’t provided the funding to install them. And so the bipartisan border security supplemental, that you helped negotiate, I was proud to vote for, did include money for the installation, but some of my colleagues across the aisle blocked the passage of this bill from the Senate. ###',\n",
       " ' View Video of Senator Rosen’s Questioning HERE WASHINGTON, DC – During an oversight hearing of the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV) raised concerns over the significant application delays impacting Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients. These delays, which average more than five months, threaten Dreamers’ ability to work and provide for their families. In her questioning, Senator Rosen asked Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for his commitment to reducing wait times. Earlier this month, after Senator Rosen joined an effort urging the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to protect DACA recipients and process renewal applications in a timely manner, USCIS agreed to increase the automatic extension period for permits. Senator Rosen has repeatedly called for a legislative fix to protect DACA recipients and provide them a pathway to citizenship. At the end of the 117th Congress, Senator Rosen gave a floor speech urging her Senate colleagues to take immediate, standalone action to permanently protect Dreamers while simultaneously continuing to work to pass comprehensive immigration reform that provides a pathway to citizenship. And after a Rosen-backed push last year, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security extended Temporary Protected Status designation for El Salvador and Honduras.\\xa0 Below is an excerpt of the exchange:\\xa0 ROSEN: Nevada is home to thousands of DACA recipients – Dreamers who know no other home than the U.S. and they’re contributing to our community every single day. But, due to significant delays in processing times, their applications to renew their work permits, well they’re just taking longer than usual – putting at risk their ability to work [and] provide for their families. I recently joined several of my colleagues in successfully urging USCIS to increase the automatic extension period for work permits from 180 days to 540 days. This month, I also joined several colleagues in calling on USCIS to provide greater certainty to DACA recipients by reducing these renewal processing times, well, just in the first place. The USCIS median processing times doubled from 2022 to 2023, with many DACA applicants waiting over five months for their application to be processed. So, can you talk to us about what are the biggest factors contributing to the delayed processing? And can you commit to working with me to reduce the times and let us know what resources you need? We can provide them.\\xa0 MAYORKAS: Senator, you certainly have my commitment to working with you on reducing the backlogs, the waiting times. We are addressing the regulatory need to extend the renewal period for work authorization. Very importantly, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has promulgated a final fee rule that will put the agency back on firm financial footing. It has not received a fee adjustment for, I believe more than seven years, even though there’s a statutory requirement that a fee rule be considered every two years. And, so I expect the financial condition of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to improve for us to be able to hire the people that we can, and address the backlogs that have indeed been growing. Despite those backlogs, I must say that USCIS, as it is known by its acronym, has done extraordinary work over and above its normal mission requirements – whether it’s uniting for Ukraine or Operation Allies Welcome, it’s a remarkable workforce characteristic of all the men and women in the Department of Homeland Security. ###',\n",

The swift response led by President Biden in conjunction with our British, Jordanian, and other regional partners saved countless lives and showed that the world is losing its patience with the Iranian regime. \\xa0 Now, it’s time for the House to act.

       " 'Washington, DC – Today, Representatives Scott Peters (CA-50) and Jen Kiggans (R-VA-02) introduced the Smart Ship Repair Act (SSRA) of 2024, a follow-up to Rep. Peters’ SSRA of 2023, which became law last year. The SSRA of 2024 would require the Navy to change its current practice of soliciting ship repair contracts on a coast-wide basis from availabilities longer than ten months to only those that are projected to last more than 18 months. Under current policy, ships homeported in San Diego that need more than ten months to complete their maintenance cycle could be moved to other facilities along the West Coast if those companies provide a more competitive bid to the Navy. This challenges how the San Diego ship repair cluster can recruit and maintain its workforce and invest in its facilities, while also forcing sailors to possibly spend their time ashore away from their families after executing a long deployment at sea. \\xa0 “San Diego is home to a vibrant ship repair industry that employs over 4,000 workers and supports the Navy’s force posture in the Asia-Pacific,” said Rep. Peters. “This bill will help protect those jobs and support a high quality of life for sailors and their families while also ensuring the Navy can meet its ship repair needs as it prepares for the threats of the future.” \\xa0 “Since 2014, the Navy’s fleet based in Hampton Roads has decreased from 48 to 28 vessels, resulting in a 30% cut to our Virginia-based ship repair workforce,” said Rep. Kiggans. “One of the best ways we can support our Navy and maintain the strength of our ship repair industry is to ensure our ships are repaired within their homeports. I am proud to join Congressman Peters in introducing the\\xa0Smart Ship Repair Act of 2024 so we can provide a better quality of life for our servicemembers and preserve the health of our defense industrial base.” \\xa0 The SSRA of 2024’s limitation on coast-wide repair solicitation only for maintenance periods longer than 18 months will stabilize the workforce and investment challenges currently confronting San Diego’s ship repair cluster, reduce the likelihood of separation for sailors and their families stationed in San Diego, and maintain flexibility for the Navy to utilize market competition to repair its fleet. This bill would also add transparency to the Navy’s ship repair solicitation process by requiring the service to report to Congress on how it estimates costs associated with ship repair. \\xa0 \"The Port of San Diego Ship Repair Association appreciates legislative efforts to extend the threshold for coast-wide bids to 18 months,” said \\xa0Gordon Rutherford, President of the Port of San Diego Ship Repair Association. “This will keep more ship repair work in Navy homeports, specifically San Diego in our case.\\xa0 We also applaud this action as a way to reduce the stress and burden on Sailors and their families when their ship undergoes extended maintenance.\" \\xa0 \"Austal USA appreciates Congressman Peters continued efforts to support and bring stability to the ship repair industry in San Diego,\" said Larry Ryder, Vice President of Business Development & External Affairs at Austal USA. \"The Smart Ship Repair Act of 2024 will help San Diego continue to provide world class ship repair services to the U.S. Navy and support jobs in San Diego.\" \\xa0 “NASSCO commends Rep. Peters for introducing this bill which will ensure our sailors and their families remain in their home port during important maintenance and repair availabilities,” said Dave Carver, President of General Dynamics NASSCO. “The coastwide extension will not only reduce the costs associated with moving vessels out of their home port, but sends a positive message to shipyards who continually invest in their facilities.” \\xa0 “BAE Systems appreciates Congressman Peters’ and Congresswoman Kiggans’ leadership on the conduct of U.S Navy ship maintenance,” said Paul Smith, Vice President and General Manager of BAE Systems Ship Repair. “Overall, the Navy’s private sector surface ship maintenance workload is reduced with fewer ships in the fleet. The Smart Ship Repair Act of 2024 will help enhance predictability and stability for repair work that is 18 months or less, a vitally important aspect that allows sailors to remain close to home during that time and preserves shipyard worker jobs in those ports.” \\xa0 Full text of the legislation can be found here.  \\xa0 ### Permalink: https://scottpeters.house.gov/2024/4/rep-peters-introduces-bill-to-bolster-ship-repair-industry-jobs-and-navy-sailors-wellbeing-in-san-diego',\n",
       " \"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Congressman Brad Finstad (MN-01) joined Congressman Zach Nunn (IA-03) in introducing the Year-Round E15 Act, bipartisan legislation that would allow for the sale of E15 across eight Midwestern states. \\xa0The\\xa0bipartisan Year-Round E15 Act\\xa0would extend the Reid vapor pressure (RVP) volatility waiver to ethanol blends above 10 percent to allow for the year-round sale of E15 in Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Minnesota, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota,\\xa0and Wisconsin for 2024.\\xa0\\xa0 “The ethanol industry is a driving force for southern Minnesota’s economy and provides a cleaner, low-cost energy source for consumers at the pump,” said Rep. Finstad. “Though the EPA recently announced the year-round sale of E15 in the Midwest starting in 2025, farmers, ethanol producers, and Americans' pocketbooks are footing the bill for this multi-year delay. I’m proud to help introduce this legislation which will allow for the sale of E15 this summer.” \\xa0“Since day one, I’ve been fighting for year-round E15. Unfortunately, this Administration has repeatedly put America’s producers and families behind as they stubbornly opposed E15, which is good for the economy, good for the climate, and good for families,” said Rep. Nunn. “This bill wouldn’t be necessary if the Administration had just done the right thing to begin with, but this is a critical step to provide certainty for farmers, producers, and families who will benefit from less expensive fuel.”  Background: In April of 2022, eight Midwestern governors submitted a letter urging the Biden Administration to allow year-round sales of E15. Under current law, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is required to act upon this request within 90 days. The EPA waited until March 6, 2023, just days before biofuel producers would have halted production, to issue a waiver for E15 sales for the summer of 2023.\\xa0 On February 9, 2023, Rep. Finstad pressed the administration for action on year-round E-15, leading a bipartisan group of 31 members of both the Senate and the House of Representatives in sending a letter to EPA and\\xa0Office of Management and Budget (OMB), urging the agencies to quickly implement their outstanding regulatory action on the request made the previous April.  In December 2023, Congressman Finstad led a bi-partisan letter urging the EPA and the OMB urging the administration to remove the 1-psi volatility waiver for gasoline and ethanol blends, like E15.\\xa0 This follow-up letter was sent 300 days after Congressman Finstad led a bicameral letter with U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) urging the EPA and the OMB to act on the request made by the Midwestern governors.  On February 22, 2024, the EPA issued its final ruling to allow for the year-round sale of E15 beginning April 28, 2025, a year after the Biden Administration’s initial proposed implementation date of April 28, 2024. By delaying the implementation, the EPA is punishing American families and farmers who have already faced record inflation, skyrocketing fuel prices, and uncertainty in the market due to the Administration’s economic policies.

Background: The Biden Administration rushed to pass the\\xa0Inflation Reduction Act and now House Republicans are having to manage the repercussions. This legislation required critical minerals in electric vehicles be sourced domestically or from a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) partner in order to qualify for its generous electric vehicle tax credit. However, the administration has found these requirements too constraining and chosen to bypass Congressional authority.

The Stop Executive Overreach on Trade Agreements Act\\xa0clearly defines FTA and only allows minerals sourced\\xa0domestically or by FTA partners to benefit from the tax credit.

Read a full transcript of her line of questioning below: Congresswoman Stefanik: Dr. Shafik, you answered one of the questions of our colleagues across the aisle. You said there has been no anti-Jewish protests. Do the other individuals on the panel agree with that? Let’s start with you Professor Schizer. Dean Emeritus and Harvey R. Miller Professor of Law & Economics Professor David Schizer: So I think there have been antisemitic protests, so I would say yes. Congresswoman Stefanik: So you disagree? There have been anti-Jewish protests. Ms. Shipman? Board of Trustees Co-Chair Claire Shipman: I know there have been a number of incidents, especially one at our law school recently that the students were trying to call a protest, but it was an event to harass admitted students who were Jewish and it's outrageous.\\xa0 Congresswoman Stefanik: So that’s anti-Jewish, so the answer would be yes? Co-Chair Shipman: Yes.\\xa0 Congresswoman Stefanik: And Mr. Greenwald? Board of Trustees Co-Chair David Greenwald: There have been antisemitic events on campus which I interpret as anti-Jewish. Congresswoman Stefanik: And Dr. Shafik, you realize that at some of these events, the slurs and the chants have been ‘F the Jews,’ ‘death to Jews,’ ‘F Israel,’ ‘no safe place,’ ‘death to the Zionist state,’ ‘Jews out,’ you don't think those are anti-Jewish? President Shafik: Completely anti-Jewish. Completely unacceptable.\\xa0 Congresswoman Stefanik: So you changed your testimony on that issue as well? So there have been anti-Jewish protests. President Shafik: I didn’t get to finish my sentence. So, what I was going to say was there were protests that were called, that were–\\xa0 Congresswoman Stefanik: That’s not what you were asked. You were asked were there any anti-Jewish protests and you said ‘No’.\\xa0 President Shafik: So the protest was not labeled as an anti-Jewish protest. It was labeled as an anti-Israeli government. But antisemitic incidents happened or antisemitic things were said. So I just wanted to finish. Congresswoman Stefanik: I’m not asking what it was labeled. The question wasn’t what it was labeled. It was a Anti-Jewish protest. You agree with that? You change your testimony?\\xa0 President Shafik: Congresswoman, anti-Jewish things were said at protests, yes.\\xa0 Congresswoman Stefanik: Thank you for changing your testimony. Another instance when you changed your testimony is: You stated that Professor Massad was no longer Chair. Then you stated he’s under investigation. He is still chair on the website. So, has he been terminated as chair?\\xa0 President Shafik: Congresswoman, I want to confirm the facts before getting back to you. Congresswoman Stefanik: I know you confirmed that he was under investigation.\\xa0\\xa0 President Shafik: Yes, I can confirm that.\\xa0 Congresswoman Stefanik: Did you confirm he was still the chair?\\xa0 President Shafik: I need to confirm that with you. I want to – I need to check.\\xa0 Congresswoman Stefanik: Well, let me ask you this: Will you make the commitment to remove him as chair?\\xa0 President Shafik: I think that would be – I think I would, yes. Let me come back with yes. But I think I just want to confirm his current status before I reply.\\xa0 Congresswoman Stefanik: We’ll take that as a yes, that you will confirm that he will no longer be chair.\\xa0 … Congresswoman Stefanik: Ms. Shipman, was there an effort to get other trustees to sign a letter supporting President Shafik?\\xa0 Co-Chair Shipman: No.\\xa0 Congresswoman Stefanik: There was not? Co-Chair Shipman: No. Congresswoman Stefanik: Will you comply with all document requests related to email correspondence regarding any potential letter? Because board members have come forward anonymously to this committee raising the issue of a letter that was circulated that members of the boards did not sign on in support. Are you testifying today under oath you have no knowledge of any draft letter in support of Dr. Shafik? Co-Chair Shipman: No knowledge whatsoever. And my understanding is we are fully complying and ready to give you whatever you need.\\xa0 Congresswoman Stefanik: Mr. Greenwald, are you aware of any letter that was circulated? Co-Chair David Greenwald: No, that's surprising to me. Congresswoman Stefanik: Professor David, are you aware? Professor David Schizer: Not at all. Congresswoman Stefanik: My final question is: There's been a lot of discussion on Columbia putting out a statement against calling for the genocide of Jews. That statement was put out after the catastrophically, morally repugnant answers by your colleagues from MIT, Penn, and Harvard, correct? That was when you put out that statement after that hearing? Dr. Shafik: Congresswoman, you shed light on an important issue.\\xa0 Congresswoman Stefanik: I'm just asking you when you put it out. It was after that hearing. Dr. Shafik: It was definitely after it because, frankly, it seemed obvious. Congresswoman Stefanik: You are aware that Congress voted 377 to 44 condemning antisemitism. That is a strong bipartisan vote. Would you support that vote condemning antisemitism? Dr. Shafik: Yes. Congresswoman Stefanik: And you are aware that in that bill, that got 377 Members out of 435 Members of Congress, condemns ‘from the river to the sea’ as antisemitic? Dr. Shafik: Yes, I am aware of that. Congresswoman Stefanik: But you dont believe ‘from the river to the sea’ is antisemitic? Dr. Shafik: We have already issued a statement to our community saying that language is hurtful and we would prefer not to hear it on our campus. Congresswoman Stefanik: You prefer not to hear it, or is there disciplinary action taken against students of those antisemitic statements? I want an answer to that question.\\xa0 Dr. Shafik: I’m sorry, can you repeat the question? Congresswoman Stefanik: Has there been disciplinary action taken against students who have chanted ‘from the river to the sea’ which you have testified as antisemitic and which Congress has voted that it is antisemitic? Dr. Shafik: We have some disciplinary cases ongoing around that language. We have specified that those kinds of chants should be restricted in terms of where they happen. We are looking at it. We are looking at it.\\xa0 Permalink: https://stefanik.house.gov/2024/4/icymi-stefanik-secures-columbia-university-president-s-commitment-to-remove-antisemitic-professor-from-leadership-role 2211 Rayburn House Office Building Washington, DC 20515 Phone: (202) 225-4611 137 Margaret Street, Suite 100 Plattsburgh, NY 12901 Phone: (518) 561-2324 Fax: (518) 561-2408 330 Ford Street, Suite B8 Ogdensburg, NY 13669 Phone: (315) 541-2670 99 Troy Road, Suite 312 East Greenbush, NY 12061 Phone: (518) 242-4707 Phone: (315) 219-8005\",\n",

President Shafik: I was not in those conversations. I think he was told that that language was unacceptable. Congresswoman Stefanik: But you’re not aware of what he was told? What was he told? President Shafik: That that language was unacceptable. Congresswoman Stefanik: And were there any other enforcement actions taken? Any other disciplinary actions taken?\\xa0 President Shafik: In his case, he has not repeated anything like that ever since.\\xa0 Congresswoman Stefanik: Does he need to repeat stating that the massacre of Israeli civilians was ‘awesome’? Does he need to repeat his participation in an unauthorized, pro-Hamas demonstration on April 4th? You know, Professor David Schizer talked about the lack of enforcement. Do you agree that this is an issue with a lack of enforcement when the policy of Columbia specifically stated on April 5th said, ‘I want to make clear that it is absolutely unacceptable for any member of this community to promote the use of terror or violence,’ and yet you have no action? No disciplinary action. Do you agree with how the university has handled this?\\xa0 President Shafik: Yeah, we have 4,700 faculty at Columbia, most of whom spend all of their time dedicated to teaching their students Congresswoman Stefanik: But I'm talking about the faculty members who are supporting terror and it's not just that case. Let me bring your attention to Mohamed Abdou who was hired after the October 7th terrorist attack against Israel. He, on October 11th, posted: ‘Yes, I'm with Hamas and Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad.’ He also decried false reports accusing Arabs and Muslims of decapitating the heads of children and being rapists. We know that there were decapitations of babies, of innocent Israeli citizens, of seniors, of women, there were rapes and yet Columbia hired this individual as a professor. How did that hiring process work? Were you aware of those statements before the hiring? President Shafik: I share with you your repugnance at those remarks. I completely understand that. On my watch, faculty who make remarks that cross the line in terms of antisemitism, there will be consequences for them. Congresswoman Stefanik: What are the consequences in this case?\\xa0 President Shafik: I have five cases at the moment who have either been either taken out of the classroom or dismissed.\\xa0 Congresswoman Stefanik: And is he one of those?\\xa0 President Shafik: He will never work at Columbia again. Congresswoman Stefanik: So he has been terminated? President Shafik: He has been terminated and not just terminated, but his files will show that he will never work at Columbia again.\\xa0 Congresswoman Stefanik: So he is currently not employed by Columbia? President Shafik: He is grading his students’ papers and will never teach at Columbia again and that will be on his permanent record. Congresswoman Stefanik: How are you changing the hiring processes? Because on your watch, he was hired after he made these statements publicly? How are you ensuring this does not happen with your hiring process going forward? President Shafik: So when we hire people, obviously they have to meet the academic qualifications, but we do an employment check and a criminal record check. We also ask everyone to do an attestation that they have never been accused of discrimination or part of an investigation around harassment or discrimination. And that attestation has to be signed by all new employees.\\xa0 Congresswoman Stefanik: And it didn’t work in this case.\\xa0 President Shafik: I think in this case, while he may not have been subject to an investigation on discrimination or found guilty, it has to be found guilty.\\xa0 Congresswoman Stefanik: But don’t you think it’s a problem when the hiring process of Columbia is hiring someone who makes those statements, and is hiring them after making those statements? President Shafik: I agree with you that I think we need to look at how to toughen up those requirements. We do have a requirement, but I agree with you. I think we need to look at how we can make it more effective.\\xa0 Congresswoman Stefanik: Let me ask about Professor Katherine Frank from the Columbia Law School who said that ‘all Israeli students who have served in the IDF are dangerous and shouldn’t be on campus.’ What disciplinary action has been taken against that professor?’ President Shafik: I agree with you that those comments are completely unacceptable and discriminatory. Congresswoman Stefanik: But I'm asking you what disciplinary action has been taken. President Shafik: She has been spoken to by very senior person in the administration and she has said that that was not what she intended to say. Congresswoman Stefanik: And has she publicly apologized?\\xa0 President Shafik: I have suggested that. I think she will be finding a way to clarify her position. Congresswoman Stefanik: You see the concern here though, with the lack of enforcement. You see the concern that speaking to these professors is not enough and it's sending a message across the university that this is tolerated. These antisemitic statements from a position of authority in professors in the classroom is tolerated. My time has expired, but I will have multiple rounds with questions. … Congresswoman Stefanik: Just to follow up, you should know this President Shafik, but Massad is still in fact listed on the Columbia website as Chair of the Academic Review Committee. Are you aware of that?\\xa0 President Shafik: I would need to check that.\\xa0 Congresswoman Stefanik: The website’s right here. So he hasn't been removed as Chair? Do you have my commitment that he'll be removed as Chair today?\\xa0 President Shafik: I have my commitment that I will come back to you and give you the facts.\\xa0 Congresswoman Stefanik: So he hasn't been removed. So you said in front of Congress, under oath, that he was removed.\\xa0 President Shafik: No, I said I am not sure. I need to check. Congresswoman Stefanik: Well, I'll tell you what he's still listed as chair. Let me ask the Board of Trustees. Is that acceptable that he's chair of this committee? Should he be removed today, Ms. Shipman? Columbia University Board of Trustees Co-Chair Claire Shipman: Congresswoman, you've put your finger on one of the hardest issues we as board chairs face right now. I think you can see our systems from the videos you played, everything you're talking about, our systems of rules and enforcement… Congresswoman Stefanik: Are broken, they're broken. My question to you, Ms. Shipman, and I'm the one asking the questions here as the United States Member of Congress, is: Do you believe that he should be removed as chair because currently he's listed as chair on Columbia University's website? Co-Chair Shipman: I don't believe any professor at Columbia should say anything like, our professors have to be held to a higher standard than our students. And I can tell you that our board–\\xa0 Congresswoman Stefanik: But you can't say at this hearing that he should be removed as chair even though he violates university rules?\\xa0 Co-Chair Shipman: I personally don’t want him as chair and we are looking at the issue of faculty and what we expect from our faculty.\\xa0 Congresswoman Stefanik: Mr. Greenwald, do you think he should be removed as chair? Columbia University Board of Trustees Co-Chair David Greenwald: His comments are abhorrent and I believe that one of the steps that we could take in terms of discipline is to remove him from that leadership position. Congresswoman Stefanik: Thank you for that direct answer. And just to let you know, Mr. Abdou is not grading papers right now. He's on campus at the unsanctioned anti-Israel, antisemitic event that is being supported by pro-Hamas activists on campus. So that's what Professor Abdou is doing at this very moment.

Find her full remarks below.\\xa0 “Today, House Republicans led by Chairwoman Foxx will continue our investigation of the heinous scourge of antisemitism running rampant on America\\'s college campuses. A few months ago, when the university presidents of Harvard, Penn, and MIT testified, they made history for their morally bankrupt answers as the most viewed testimony in the history of the United States Congress. And two are now former presidents.\\xa0 And after billions of views and world outcry, it set off a long overdue earthquake in higher education. The Columbia University President was invited to that hearing but did not attend. Today, the Columbia President will appear in front of the Education and Workforce Committee along with board of trustee leaders, and we will hold them accountable for their failure to combat antisemitism on their campus and their failure to protect Jewish students. For over 200 years, Columbia University has held the same motto “in thy light shall we see light”. Taken from Psalms, Columbia claims to work in God’s light. Sadly, for all the Jewish students on their campus, this could not be further from the truth. Fueled by hatred and ignorance, unchecked antisemitism has become commonplace on Columbia’s campus: Nazi-era antisemitic propaganda litters the grounds, Swastikas graffiti school property, and mobs assaulting Jewish students, professors openly supporting Hamas and calling for genocide of the Jewish people. Meanwhile, despite claims otherwise, Columbia’s leadership refuses to enforce their own policies and condemn Jewish hatred on campus creating a breeding ground for antisemitism and a hotbed of support for terrorism from radicalized faculty and students. Just look at the campus reaction following the tragic events of October 7th. Over 150 Columbia faculty justified the terrorist attack on Israel resulting in the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust. A Columbia Professor penned an article glorifying Hamas, and anti-Israel student groups invited known members of a terrorist group to speak in support of the terrorist slaughter.\\xa0 This hearing is an important step towards transparency and accountability in Chairwoman Foxx’s investigation and in our oversight of the failure of colleges and universities to condemn and combat antisemitism and their failure to protect Jewish students.\\xa0 Before our hearing, we wanted to make sure America hears the firsthand experiences directly from Jewish students studying at Columbia.

So as she looks at the past couple of months as the earthquake and the reckoning, and those two presidents became former presidents, there's been clearly a lot of preparation. She hired PR consultants, various attorneys, to prepare today's testimony that's not going to cover-up for the failure of Columbia University to fail to protect Jewish students. They have tolerated and allowed professors who have antisemitic, consistent remarks targeting Jewish students. It includes assault. They have not ensured that their rules are applied, for example, they have rules when it comes to where student groups can protest and anti Israeli groups are breaking those rules and there's no disciplinary action taken. So we're going to ask those tough questions of this Columbia University professor. But I'll tell you, they're working overtime to try to cover this up. You saw an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal. My question though is, they hired so many PR consultants to help the university presidents, how many people have they hired on campus to combat antisemitism? The answer is zero. And I will hold them accountable. We will hold them accountable. On Calls For The President Of Columbia University To Resign: Well, certainly with her failure to condemn antisemitism, yes. That is going to be exposed in full at this hearing. No matter how much preparation, the facts are there. This is rampant on Columbia and it's one of the dens of antisemitism that's the worst on college campuses.

       " 'Washington, D.C. – In case you missed it, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik wrote the following opinion in North Country Now about her commitment to ensuring Upstate New York and North Country hospitals have the resources necessary to expand access to care throughout the region. Find the full opinion below. North Country Now: Stefanik touts Protecting Rural Access to Care Act By Congresswoman Elise Stefanik During my tenure in Congress, I have strongly advocated for delivering high-quality rural healthcare for our families and seniors. A primary concern not only for my constituents across New York’s 21st Congressional District, but for millions of Americans living in rural communities across our country, is access to quality and affordable healthcare. These communities depend on their local hospitals to provide lifesaving care and treatments for their families yet the unique challenges of serving remote areas have led an increasing number of rural hospitals to shut down over the past decade. In fact, according to data from the University of North Carolina’s Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research, 191 rural hospitals have closed or converted to emergency or outpatient care over the last 18 years. These providers face the uniquely difficult task of providing excellent care despite immense financial challenges that have only been exacerbated in recent years. Rising costs paired with low-patient volume and a greater reliance on federal and state funds has led many rural hospitals to struggle to remain financially viable. These barriers led the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to develop several payment program options that allow for higher reimbursements for certain services provided by qualifying rural hospitals. Of the numerous CMS payment programs, the Critical Access Hospital (CAH) designation has proven to be highly effective in reducing the financial vulnerability of rural hospitals and increasing access to care throughout medically underserved regions. CAHs receive higher reimbursements for their Medicare services provided, allowing them to remain open and keep essential healthcare services in rural communities. Across NY-21, Lewis County General Hospital, Carthage Area Hospital, River Hospital, University of Vermont Health Network - Elizabethtown and Alice Hyde Medical Center, Clifton-Fine Hospital, Massena Hospital, and Gouverneur Hospital all maintain a CAH designation. I have long since advocated for the CAH designation as I understand its importance to hospitals across my district. In January 2021, I recognized an error in CMS’s certification policy that unjustly narrowed the eligibility criteria for hospitals to certify or recertify as a CAH. In response, I authored the bipartisan Protecting Rural Access to Care Act to protect hospitals at risk of losing their designation. Then in June 2021, I called on CMS to reverse this harmful policy and brought this concern to the Department of Health and Human Services on behalf of vulnerable hospitals at risk of losing their CAH statuses. I was proud to see that following my advocacy CMS decided to reverse its disastrous policy and as a result, Carthage Area Hospital in NY-21 was able to maintain its designation. Not only did my critical legislation and constant pressure force CMS to reverse course and allow Carthage Area Hospital to keep its CAH status, but it also opened the door for other hospitals across the region to qualify as well. I was pleased to see that in November 2023, Alice Hyde Medical Center of Malone received their CAH designation as a direct result of my efforts as well. I also sent a letter of support to CMS on behalf of Massena Hospital in December 2023 and I am happy to report that they were recently granted their CAH status as a result. My office is supporting other hospitals in the region as they navigate the application process with CMS and I look forward to continuing to advocate on their behalf. As the representative for NY-21, I remain steadfast in my commitment to ensuring our hospitals have the resources necessary to expand access to care throughout Upstate New York and the North Country.

Head-related trauma, including traumatic brain injury (TBI), is sometimes referred to as the ‘signature injury’ for post-9/11 veterans due to the increased TBI prevalence among veterans of this generation. Wounded Warrior Project’s (WWP’s) 2022 Annual Warrior Survey found that 36.5% of WWP warriors self-reported experiencing TBI due to military service,” said Jen Silva, Chief Program Officer of the Wounded Warrior Project. “The Blast Overpressure Safety Act will help protect Service members from blast overpressure and TBI; improve research and data collection regarding brain health and safety; and expand access to effective treatments and support for veterans with a brain injury.

       " 'Washington, D.C.\\xa0–\\xa0At the House Ways and Means Committee hearing on President Biden\\'s trade agenda, Congressman Darin LaHood (IL-16) pressed U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai on the need to address the Administration\\'s lack of leadership on digital trade policy and Brazil\\'s discriminatory tariffs on American ethanol, which continue to harm Illinois farmers and producers. On both digital trade policy and the Brazil ethanol tariff issue, Rep. LaHood has led letters to the Administration pushing them to exert American leadership in the global economy.\\xa0 LaHood’s questioning can be viewed here or below: In remarks on the Administration’s digital trade position, Rep. LaHood stated: “I am the Co-Chair with Congresswoman DelBene of the Digital Trade Caucus. Many of us on this side of the aisle are exceedingly frustrated with the Administration’s inability to promote a coherent trade agenda. When we think about digital trade, obviously there is growing concern about the Chinese Communist Party’s global economic influence, and their promotion of digital trade policies that run counter to American ideals. These Chinese policies promote censorship and surveillance, encourage human rights abuses, and force unwanted technology transfers through initiatives like the Digital Silk Road.Rather than providing a free-market alternative to the CCP’s digital governance model, this Administration sends mixed messages on the global stage by walking back long-held, bipartisan digital trade proposals outlined at the World Trade Organization without clearly articulating a policy path forward.Last November, Congresswoman DelBene and I co-led a bipartisan letter along with 36 House colleagues to you underscoring how your decision threatens America’s leadership and ultimately harms American businesses and workers. This decision, as we mentioned, was made without any sufficient congressional input.\" LaHood went on to question USTR’s actions on the discriminatory tariffs Brazil has placed on American ethanol, saying: “I want to highlight a Bloomberg article that came out last week titled, \\'Brazil Rebuffs U.S. Pressure to Abandon Tariffs on Ethanol Imports.\\' Can you comment on the current negotiations with Brazil? It is immensely frustrating for our ethanol producers in this country. What actions are the Administration going to take?\" ###\\xa0 Permalink: https://lahood.house.gov/2024/4/lahood-stresses-importance-of-addressing-digital-trade-retreat-and-brazil-s-biofuels-tariffs-at-hearing-with-u-s-trade-representative 1424 Longworth HOB Washington, DC 20515 Phone: (202) 225-6201 Fax: (202) 225-9249 100 NE Monroe Street Room 100 Peoria, IL 61602 Phone: (309) 671-7027 Fax: (309) 671-7309 527 Colman Center Drive Rockford, IL 61108 Phone: (779) 238-4785 108 East Beaufort Street Normal, IL 61761 Phone: (309) 445-8080 1715 North Division Street Suite E Morris, IL 60450',\n",
       " 'Washington, D.C.\\xa0–\\xa0The House Ways and Means Committee yesterday advanced the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) Reform Act, which includes Congressman Darin LaHood’s (IL-16) Digital Trade for Development Act. This forward-looking legislation brings the GSP into the 21st Century economy by promoting economic growth around the world and preventing the proliferation of restrictive digital trade policies. The bill’s inclusion counters China’s growing economic influence in the developing world. In remarks during Committee debate on the\\xa0General System of Preferences Reform Act, Rep. LaHood stated:\\xa0 \"I want to commend this body for taking up the important task of renewing and revising the Generalized System of Preferences.The updates that we are considering today will not only promote economic growth around the world but also provide much needed modernization to GSP – America’s oldest trade preference program.I also want to acknowledge Trade Subcommittee Chairman Smith for his leadership and advocacy on both a renewed GSP and on the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill, or MTB.These trade preference programs are vital to promoting American manufacturing and ensuring U.S. global leadership, and it is regrettable that we allowed both programs to expire nearly three and a half years ago.The GSP bill before us today is the first step in getting back on track and I look forward to moving the bill forward and hopefully considering an MTB renewal in the near future as well.I am especially pleased that the GSP renewal bill we are marking up today incorporates my bill, the Digital Trade for Development Act, which will add new criteria for countries seeking beneficiary status to account for digital trade barriers and deter the proliferation of restrictive digital trade policies.It is no secret that China has a goal of challenging America’s leadership in the developing world.As co-chair of the Digital Trade Caucus, I am increasingly concerned by the growing evidence of developing countries enacting similar digital trade policies to China’s restrictive Cybersecurity Law.Updating and reforming the GSP to support sound digital trade policies advances American strategic interests around the world and protects small and medium-sized businesses from these costly and restrictive digital trade regimes.I appreciate the Chairman’s inclusion of my bill in the overarching legislation before us, I look forward to supporting the bill shortly, and I yield back.\" Background on the Generalized System of Preferences and the Digital Trade for Development Act:Created by Congress in the 1970s to spur economic development in poor countries through trade, the GSP is a trade program that provides nonreciprocal, duty-free treatment for certain U.S. imports from eligible developing countries. Beneficiary developing countries (BDCs) are selected based on certain mandatory eligibility criteria. The last authorized GSP program expired on December 31, 2020. Today’s renewal legislation would also extend the GSP program through 2030. Evidence suggests that several developing countries are enacting similar digital trade policies to China\\'s restrictive Cybersecurity Law and related measures at the detriment to their own economic interests. These countries benefit from duty-free access to American markets under the GSP while employing digital policies that undermine American values, jobs, and exports. Updating and reforming the GSP to support sound digital trade policies will advance American strategic interests around the world and promote economic development in the developing world.The Digital Trade for Development Act would incorporate digital trade as a statutory consideration in designating beneficiary developing countries (BDCs) under the GSP. The legislation would permit the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) to prevent countries from receiving BDC status if, for example, they restrict the free flow of data or force other restrictive e-commerce policies to the detriment of U.S. strategic interests aimed at technology sectors. ###\\xa0 Permalink: https://lahood.house.gov/2024/4/lahood-s-digital-trade-for-development-act-passes-ways-and-means-committee-as-part-of-generalized-system-of-preferences-reform-act 1424 Longworth HOB Washington, DC 20515 Phone: (202) 225-6201 Fax: (202) 225-9249 100 NE Monroe Street Room 100 Peoria, IL 61602 Phone: (309) 671-7027 Fax: (309) 671-7309 527 Colman Center Drive Rockford, IL 61108 Phone: (779) 238-4785 108 East Beaufort Street Normal, IL 61761 Phone: (309) 445-8080 1715 North Division Street Suite E Morris, IL 60450',\n",

Despite this flagrantly elitist and antidemocratic campaign, the highest court in the land continues to have the lowest ethical standards. This legislation takes a crucial step towards rebuilding the Supreme Court’s tarnished reputation and restoring its lost credibility with the American people. I\\'m grateful to my colleagues Representatives Stansbury and Omar for working with me to forward this critical effort to establish an Office of the Inspector General within the judicial branch. Thank you to Senator Blumenthal for leading the introduction of companion legislation in the Senate.” “Like every other federal entity, the Judiciary needs an Inspector General to deter and investigate internal wrongdoing — and restore public trust. After years of plummeting public confidence, the Courts need a watchdog to do prompt, impartial investigations of alleged conflicts of interest, improper benefits or other potential wrongdoing. Any ethics rules or code of conduct requires public accountability — otherwise it’s dead letter — as the Inspector General would provide,” said Sen. Blumenthal.\\xa0 “Americans have lost trust in the Supreme Court,” said Rep. Stansbury. “Strong judicial ethics are critical to a free and democratic society. Safeguarding these fundamentals is necessary to ensuring we restore faith in our democracy and our institutions, and an Inspector General will hold the Justices internally accountable to the highest ethical standards to protect the Court from special interest groups looking to strip Americans of their rights to protect their personal agendas.” “For far too long, the highest court in our land has operated without true oversight,\" said Rep. Ilhan Omar. \"The American people deserve to have faith that the decisions being made by our judicial system are guided by the principles of fairness and the rule of law – not partisan politics or personal conflicts of interest. Our democracy depends on the integrity and impartiality of our judicial system. But in recent years, we\\'ve seen growing public mistrust as the Court has become increasingly ideological. This bill sends a clear message that the American people deserve transparency, accountability, and a Supreme Court that upholds the highest standards of ethical conduct.”\\xa0 Specifically, the Judicial Ethics Enforcement Act of 2024 would: Create an Office of the Inspector General within the Judicial branch. Authorize the Inspector General to conduct investigations of alleged violations of the Code of Conduct for Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States. Authorize the powers and limitations of the Office of the Inspector General when investigating the Court. Structure the duties of the Inspector General which would include conducting and supervising audits and investigations, preventing and detecting waste, fraud, and abuse; and recommending changes in laws or regulations relating to the code of conduct adopted by the Supreme Court. Require the Inspector General to make prompt reports to the Chief Justice and to Congress on matters that may require action by the Chief Justice or Congress. Require the Inspector General to report expeditiously to the Attorney General whenever the Inspector General has reasonable grounds to believe there has been a violation of Federal criminal law.\\xa0 Require the Inspector General to provide an annual report to both the House of Representatives and the Senate on the results of their investigations. Set appointments, term limits and removals of the inspector general. Provide protection for whistleblowers. Statements of support from organizations endorsing the legislation are below:\\xa0\\xa0 “The Supreme Court’s ongoing corruption crisis has undermined its credibility and caused public trust to plummet to record lows. Since the conflicted justices refuse to cut off their cozy relationships with their billionaire buddies, the crisis requires an urgent solution. The Judicial Ethics Enforcement Act is just that,” said Accountable.US President Caroline Ciccone. “Thanks to the strong leadership of Representatives Stansbury, Raskin, Omar, Hank Johnson, and several other original cosponsors, we’re one step closer to ensuring our high court serves everyday Americans — not justices’ wealthy pals and special interests.”\\xa0 “CPD is proud to endorse the Judicial Ethics Enforcement Act and fight for the checks and balances this nation was founded upon,” said CPD Co-Executive Directors, Analilia Mejia and DaMareo Cooper. “Today’s Supreme Court is controlled by ultraconservative justices buried deep in the pockets of special interest groups committed to stripping our freedoms. It’s high time we held the Court to an ethics code that forces them to act with the fairness their job demands.” “The Supreme Court is in a state of crisis—between the corruption permeating its halls and the attacks on our fundamental freedoms, Americans have lost faith in our highest court,” said Tiffany Muller, President of End Citizens United // Let America Vote Action Fund. “The Judicial Ethics Enforcement Act of 2024 is a necessary step in holding the court accountable and restoring Americans’ confidence in the institution. We thank Congresswoman Stansbury and Senator Blumenthal for their ongoing leadership in the fight to reform the Supreme Court.”\\xa0 ###\\xa0 \\xa0 Permalink: https://raskin.house.gov/2024/4/reps-raskin-stansbury-and-omar-push-for-supreme-court-accountability-with-new-legislation',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON, DC – Representatives Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-1), Chris Pappas (NH-1), Dan Kildee (MI-18), and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (NY) re-introduced the bipartisan, bicameral Clean Water Standards for PFAS Act. This legislation requires EPA to develop water criteria for PFAS under the Clean Water Act and provides EPA with an ambitious yet achievable roadmap to establish effluent limitations guidelines (ELGs) and standards for eight priority industry categories for all measurable PFAS or classes of PFAS within three years. The bill also includes significant federal support to assist communities in upgrading their municipal water infrastructure in order to safeguard public health and protect ratepayers. “Congress must do everything it can to set and enforce criteria to keep PFAS (per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances) chemicals out of Americans’ drinking water,” said Congressional PFAS Task Force Co-Chair Congressman Fitzpatrick. “I am proud to join Reps. Pappas and Kildee and Sen. Gillibrand in introducing the Clean Water Standards for PFAS Act to improve water quality, prevent the leakage of these ‘forever chemicals’ and ensure that our drinking water will be safe for every generation to come.” \"The dangers posed by ‘forever chemicals’ like PFAS remain one of the most pressing environmental and public health issues of our time,\" said Congressman Chris Pappas. “The Clean Water Standards for PFAS Act will finally take action to hold polluters accountable, establish proactive limits for PFAS, set water quality criteria, and support communities with contaminated water. No industry should be given a free pass to poison our water, no community should bear the burden of addressing this challenge alone, and no family should ever have to wonder whether their drinking water is safe when they turn on the tap. I am proud to re-introduce this legislation today, and I will keep fighting to protect our water until it is enacted into law.\" \"Access to safe, affordable drinking water should be a right, not a privilege,\" said Congressman Kildee. \"I’m proud to be introducing this critical bill to hold corporate polluters accountable and protect our communities from dangerous PFAS chemicals. As co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional PFAS Task Force, I will continue working with Republicans and Democrats to protect mid-Michigan families from these toxic chemicals.\" “Access to clean water and healthy environments is an essential right that all Americans deserve, yet is actively under threat due to the PFAS contamination crisis,” said Senator Gillibrand. “For decades, thousands of manufacturers have been allowed to legally discharge PFAS, exposing far too many communities across New York State and the country to these toxic chemicals. The Clean Water Standards for PFAS Act would finally address these harmful industrial discharges and complement EPA’s recently announced first-ever national drinking water standard for PFAS. I’m proud to work alongside Representative Pappas on this important bill and will keep fighting to protect the public from dangerous PFAS chemicals.”\\xa0 “Industries shouldn’t be able to dump as much PFAS as they like into nearby rivers, streams, and lakes, putting the health of their neighbors at risk,” said Melanie Benesh, Vice President for Government Affairs at the Environmental Working Group. “The Clean Water Standards for PFAS Act is a critical piece of legislation that will ensure that the EPA acts quickly to turn off the tap on some of the most notorious PFAS polluting industries.” “NACWA is pleased to support the Clean Water Standards for PFAS Act. This legislation sets timelines and parameters around EPA actions underway to regulate PFAS under the Clean Water Act, including pretreatment standards, effluent limits, and water quality standards. The bill smartly targets industrial PFAS discharges to waterways and industrial discharges to clean water agencies as a key first step - in line with “Polluter Pays” principles. Through public clean water agencies’ pretreatment programs,\\xa0 these utilities can work with industrial dischargers to implement these limits and protect the environment and public health. The bill also requires EPA to promulgate a final method to measure PFAS in wastewater and other key environmental media – an essential step that utilities need before being required to meet CWA limits. These actions will require significant investment and work by clean water agencies – who are willing to be an equitable part of the solution but are not the source of PFAS. For this reason, the bill’s authorization of $1 billion between Fiscal Years 2024-2028 recognizes the need to ensure ratepayers are not held responsible for industry actions and have the financial support needed to meet the requirements set out in this legislation,” said Adam Krantz, CEO of the National Association of Clean Water Agencies.

       " 'WASHINGTON, DC – Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-1), Brad Wenstrup (OH-2), Mike Carey (OH-15), Ruben Gallego (AZ-3), Lou Correa (CA-46), and Carol Miller (WV-1) introduced H.R. 8059, the U.S. Foreign Trade Zone Parity Act, a bipartisan bill to prevent U.S. trade policy from favoring the foreign e-commerce distribution operations that undermine U.S.-based operations. Current U.S. law allows companies to ship products directly from foreign warehouses to U.S. consumers duty and tax-free (including exemption from additional Section 301 China tariffs) if the products are valued at $800 or less. Retailers and brands located within U.S.-based foreign trade zones (FTZs) are barred from this same duty-free benefit on otherwise identical shipments and face up to a 60% cost disadvantage per shipment. This bill fixes that issue, allowing companies operating in the nearly 300 U.S. based FTZs to utilize de minimis entry procedures, creating parity with foreign distributors. The U.S. Foreign Trade Zone Parity Act complements the Ways and Means Committee’s strong action this week to crack down on China’s de minimis abuses by making products subject to the Section 301 tariffs ineligible for de minimis entry. “E-commerce shipments from outside the United States should not be afforded special treatment compared to shipments from inside the U.S.,” said Congressman Fitzpatrick.\\xa0 “I’m proud to co-sponsor this bipartisan legislation that would create parity in U.S. trade laws and preserve the jobs of hardworking Americans.” \"Our current trade policy counterintuitively benefits adversaries like China, and causes the loss of American jobs and opportunity. I believe it\\'s important for our trade and foreign policy to align; and I\\'m pleased that my colleagues, both Democrat and Republican, have joined me on this bill to ensure our trade policy doesn\\'t punish U.S. businesses operating within the U.S.,\" said Congressman Wenstrup. “For nearly a century, U.S. Foreign Trade Zones have supported American jobs, improved trade and lessened our dependence on foreign adversaries. However, it’s time we update our trade rules for a 21st century economy. I’m proud to join Representative Wenstrup in this effort to keep America competitive,” said Congressman Carey. “Foreign Trade Zones are vital to the strength of our supply chain and for supporting U.S. jobs,” said Congressman Gallego. “I am proud to back this bill to finally bring parity to FTZs, ease supply chain burdens, and keep our economy moving.” \"The National Association of Foreign-Trade Zones (NAFTZ) is grateful for the introduction of the bipartisan U.S. Foreign Trade Zone Parity Act of 2024 (H.R. 8059) led by Representatives Brad Wenstrup (R-OH) and co-sponsored by Lou Correa (D-CA), Carol Miller (R-WV), Ruben Gallego (D-AZ), Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA), and Mike Carey (R-OH). The legislation will level the playing field for U.S.-based operations distributing from an FTZ and ensure retention of American jobs while spurring further economic growth within the boundaries of the United States. Congressman Wenstrup’s bill eliminates the existing incentive to establish or relocate operations across the border, resulting in no change to the volume of de minimis trade, only where those transactions originate and extends that parity to operations under the oversight of two distinct federal agencies. We recognize the on-going dialogue associated with de minimis entry and this legislation is intended solely to provide parity to U.S. FTZs based on whatever action Congress ultimately takes where de minimis is concerned,\" said Jeff Tafel, President, the National Association of Foreign-Trade Zones.

The full letter can be read\\xa0here\\xa0and below: Dear Governor Walz,We write to you today to express our outrage at the ongoing prosecution of State Trooper Ryan Londregan, and the continued attack on law enforcement officers. We also write to inform you that we will be requesting the House Judiciary Committee conduct an investigation on this matter. Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty has weaponized her position against law enforcement. She ignored an independent use-of-force expert chosen by her own office, who stated that Trooper Londregan acted as a “reasonable officer” would have. The fact that Trooper Londregan is still being charged with second-degree murder, along with other charges, after this statement from the prosecution’s own expert can lead us to only one conclusion; this prosecution is politically motivated.We’ve seen the tragic consequences of the denigration of this noble profession. In 2023, 378 officers were shot in the line of duty, the highest number since the Fraternal Order of Police began collecting this data. Too many of these deaths hit close to home here in Minnesota. The split second that officers have to make life-and-death decisions has often been clouded by the fear of political persecution, like what is happening to Trooper Londregan right now. Enough is enough. The uncertainty that this frivolous case puts in officers' minds could cost them their lives.It is time for us as a nation to stop demonizing law enforcement. It is time for you to remove this case from the Hennepin County Attorney’s office. It is time for you to listen to Minnesota’s law enforcement community and ensure that Trooper Londregan is treated fairly under the law. Respectfully, Congressman Tom Emmer Congresswoman Michelle Fischbach Congressman Pete Stauber Congressman Brad Finstad  Background\\xa0 State Trooper Londregan was charged with felony counts of second-degree unintentional murder, first-degree assault, and second-degree manslaughter after he shot and killed Ricky Cobb II. An expert concluded Trooper Londregan followed his training and acted lawfully to save his partner's life.

       " ' Washington, D.C. – Today, in an effort to bolster America’s national security, Congressman Tom Emmer (MN-06) introduced the Ammunition Supply Chain Act. The legislation aims to ensure the resilience and efficiency of our nation’s ammunition manufacturing supply chain. Senator Jim Risch (R-ID) introduced companion legislation in the United States Senate.\\xa0 The Ammunition Supply Chain Act requires the Secretary of the Army to provide a comprehensive report to Congress on the supply chain of ammunition manufacturing. The report will include information on sourcing raw materials used in ammunition production, examining weaknesses in the existing supply chain and the global demand for ammunition, and providing strategies for fostering public-private partnerships.\\xa0 “As threats to our nation’s security evolve, it is more important than ever to take proactive measures to secure our ammunition supply chain. This is not only about enhancing our military readiness but also supporting American manufacturing and ensuring law-abiding Minnesotans and Americans can exercise their Second Amendment rights,” Congressman Emmer said.\\xa0  \"This administration\\xa0creates as many ridiculous hurdles\\xa0as possible to\\xa0restrict\\xa0law-abiding gun owners’ access to\\xa0affordable guns and ammunition,” said Senator Risch. “The Ammunition Supply Chain Act\\xa0forces transparency from the Biden administration about the status of our domestic ammunition supply chain. This is vital to protect our right to bear arms and to ensure our military has the ammunition it needs to protect our country.”   Background Due to a rise in the use of ammunition and artillery in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, countries around the world are battling shortages of key materials needed for ammunition production, resulting in domestic ammunition prices skyrocketing, limiting millions of Americans’ ability to exercise their Second Amendment rights. Congressman Emmer has consistently championed and defended American’s Second Amendment rights. He recently introduced legislation to provide recourse for law-abiding Americans who were improperly denied the ability to legally purchase a firearm. Furthermore, Emmer staunchly opposed the Biden Administration’s crackdowns on stabilizing braces in 2023.\\xa0 The Ammunition Supply Chain Act is cosponsored by Representatives Pete Stauber, Brad Finstad, Michelle Fischbach, Rick Crawford and Bruce Westerman.  The legislation is supported by the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) and Vista Outdoor.

       " 'WASHINGTON, D.C.\\xa0— Today, U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced resources from several federal agencies for projects that will bolster health services, economic development, infrastructure, academic and defense research, park improvement efforts, and energy projects across West Virginia. HHS FUNDING: Senator Capito, Ranking Member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies (Labor-HHS), announced grants from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for a variety of health projects in West Virginia. “From cancer detection to primary care, I was excited to secure resources from HHS that will bolster the health care infrastructure in West Virginia,” Ranking Member Capito said. “Through my position as the top Republican on the Labor-HHS Appropriations Subcommittee, I am able to advocate for our state’s needs and bring funding to support projects that will help West Virginians access the medical care they need.” EPA FUNDING: Senator Capito, Ranking Member of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, announced funding to the West Virginia Department of Transportation (WV DOT) through the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to rebuild a portion of West Virginia State Route 39. Senator Capito previously wrote a letter of support for this project to U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Secretary Pete Buttigieg. “The WV 39 reconstruction project is critical to the security and way of life of residents in the Richwood community, and it’s why I wrote Secretary Buttigieg to strongly support approval of this grant application in 2023. I am thrilled that this portion of WV 39 will be reconstructed and better protected from flooding as a result of this funding,” Ranking Member Capito said. ARC FUNDING: Senator Capito also announced resources from the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) to support two projects in West Virginia, one addressing the addiction crisis and another for broadband connectivity. “As the Ranking Member of the EPW Committee, which oversees the ARC, I know firsthand how critical it is to support efforts that help strengthen communities across West Virginia. These grants will go toward improving health outcomes for West Virginians, helping those struggling with addiction, and better connecting our communities through broadband deployment,” Ranking Member Capito said. DOE FUNDING: Senator Capito announced resources from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for research that will help support the development of our domestic hydrogen industry at West Virginia University (WVU) through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and other energy innovation resources. “As a lead negotiator of the IIJA, I knew that WVU would play a critical role in the energy innovation of the future and I am excited to see them taking on this challenge in hydrogen production,” Ranking Member Capito said. “These projects will support advancements in energy and I look forward to seeing the results from researchers at WVU and other research leaders in Morgantown.” DOT FUNDING: Senator Capito, a member of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, announced a tranche of DOT Airport Improvement Grants (AIGs) to airports across West Virginia to conduct improvements and repairs at the facilities. “Airports across West Virginia, especially in rural areas, provide critical access for residents across our state to connect with other parts of the country,”\\xa0Senator Capito said. “These grants will help West Virginia airports make the necessary repairs and improvements that will assist them as they continue to serve Mountain State residents.” NPS FUNDING: Senator Capito also secured several grants for local parks that will improve outdoor spaces for communities across West Virginia. “I was pleased to secure grant funding that will make outdoor spaces across West Virginia a better place to visit and enjoy,” Senator Capito said. “The improvements will make our small towns even better places to experience all the wild and wonderful opportunities our state has to offer.” NSF FUNDING:\\xa0Senator Capito announced grants from the National Science Foundation (NSF) for a variety of research projects at WVU and Marshall University. “West Virginia’s research institutions are some of the best in the world, and I was proud to make sure that they received needed support to pursue these academic undertakings. I know they have some of the brightest minds working on this and I am excited to see what they can find in these new projects,”\\xa0Senator Capito said.  DOD FUNDING: Senator Capito, a member of the Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, announced a funding opportunity for WVU through the Defense Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (DEPSCoR). “West Virginia has a proud history of military service, shown through generations of active-duty service members and veterans, as well as workers and companies that equip our military with the tools to keep them safe and effective. I was proud to work to secure resources at WVU that will help them ensure our military remains the strongest and most advanced force in the world,” Senator Capito said.

During her first round of questions, Ranking Member Capito spoke about the importance of rural healthcare and efforts to combat the addiction crisis, specifically efforts taken by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in communities across West Virginia and the country. Additionally, Ranking Member Capito asked Secretary Becerra about the suicide prevention hotline (988) and its effectiveness across the country since it opened. During her second round of questions, Ranking Member Capito asked Secretary Becerra about medical research efforts overseen by HHS and return to in-person office policies for HHS employees across the country. HIGHLIGHTS:  ON THE IMPORTANCE OF RURAL HEALTH CARE: RANKING MEMBER CAPITO: “I want to talk about rural health because I mentioned in my opening statement that $12 million—it appears as though it's $12 million lower [than last year]. I understand that our bill funded it at 36— I think $364.6 million, which is rural outreach, rural hospital flexibility, and other things. The [HHS rural health budget] request is for $352 [million], which is lower- $12.2 [million] lower than what we actually funded this for. I understand, also, that the budget release and then the timing of the actual passing of the budget, were almost at the exact same time might not have been ideal for you. What would you say about that? Healthcare delivery systems in rural America are still very difficult and underfunded. We have the lowest life expectancies in rural America. What's your response to that?” SEC. BECERRA: “Senator, you actually touched on, probably, the most important aspect of my answer and that is that our budget was being framed at a time that we have no idea what the 2024 budget would look like. And because of the constraints on where we could go, we had to make sure- we tried to be consistent with what might come out. So, we are more than willing to work with you, with the kinds of investments we would make in healthcare generally, but more specifically with regard to rural health, you will find that there are specific investments in rural health, especially in the area of substance use disorders and trying to keep hospitals afloat that we can work on to build on. Because, I think you're right, there's no doubt that it's tougher, if you're in a rural community, to find a health care facility near you. So, we'll do everything we can to not just have them sustain but also have them thrive.” ON OPIOID OVERDOSE NUMBERS REMAINING AT RECORD HIGHS AND PREVENTION EFFORTS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE: RANKING MEMBER CAPITO: “I did have a lot of questions on drug abuse and SAMHSA prevention and harm reduction. Here's the discouraging thing: these statistics are not coming down. I mean, the overdose statistics I heard on the radio the other day, that the statistics in [Washington] D.C., alone, are up, I don't know, 20, 30%— deaths resulting from overdose. I don't think we have the statistics quite yet for this past year. We've got a flow of fentanyl coming up through the southern border. We got to do better here. I mean, we are losing a generation. And I understand, in your last answer, some of the areas, you know, fentanyl strips and naloxone. But that's still just treating somebody who's already in heavy addiction. I mean, I think the prevention aspects of it, have not gotten to the younger children as much as they should. We got to start in kindergarten. What's your response to that?” SEC. BECERRA: “[I’m] with you, completely with you on that. Here's the difficulty: as you know, at the federal level, the Department Health and Human Services, we don't administer these programs, we work with the states. The states are the ones that have control over health care, and this aspect of health care. What we do is, essentially, provide them with more- more resources, or we give them some support and flexibility in doing what they can with the dollars that we give them. We are more than willing to work with the states to increase their capacities.” ON THE EFFICACY OF 988 SUICIDE PREVENTION HOTLINE CALL CENTERS: RANKING MEMBER CAPITO: “Quickly on the suicide prevention line: you've asked for a lot more money here. We've provided a fourfold increase in fiscal year 2023. You're requesting $100 million more for [Fiscal Year] 2025. And I'm wondering, can you give me a breakdown- you might not have that right now- but how is this breaking out? Is it going out the door to state and local crisis centers, versus a contractor that's administering the system? I’d just like some more details on this request given the sensitive nature of the program and the critical work they do.” SEC. BECERRA: “Certainly, and we could follow up with your staff to give you more of the details, because those are out there. Most of the money helps sustain the state operation, the call centers that already existed. We essentially have buoyed them, because we established backup call centers, because a lot of the states didn't have the capacity to deal with all the calls that might come in. We didn't want people waiting on the phone, busy signal, so we set- we stood up all the backup call centers. We also make specialty lines. So, for example, if you're a veteran, there's a line that's specific for you. Those are the things that the federal dollars have really helped boost. We also helped create the text and chat feature so that if you didn't want to—” RANKING MEMBER CAPITO: “Is that online now?” SEC. BECERRA: “Absolutely. It's available now for hearing impaired. It's available, in some places, Spanish language. We're trying to make sure no one feels like they should not call. And now you hear that we're going to finally get to the point where we can make the 988 call work so that wherever you are, whatever your three digit- your area code is, you're going to get some professional where you happen to be, not based on your area code. It's working. The $600 million that is in the president's budget for 988 is absolutely going to save lives. We know that in the first 18 months of launching national 988, a million and a half people reached out to us and said ‘help.’ We were able to answer.” # # # \\nTags: \\nHealth Care, Fighting Drug Epidemic\\n\",\n",
       " ' Click\\xa0here or the image above to watch Ranking Member Capito’s opening remarks from the committee hearing. WASHINGTON, D.C.\\xa0– Today, the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee held a\\xa0hearing\\xa0on the nomination of Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Chairman Christopher Hanson to serve another term. Below is the\\xa0opening statement\\xa0of Ranking Member Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) as delivered. “Thank you, Chairman Carper, for calling today’s hearing. “And thank you, Chair Hanson, for being here today. “I certainly have appreciated our conversations both in person and on the phone. Probably did a few Zooms during COVID, and you’ve always been very open and ready to respond so I appreciate that. “During your tenure, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has been preparing for the expected increase in advanced nuclear licensing and regulatory work, while also ensuring the safe and secure operation of today’s nuclear reactors and nuclear materials. “Based on projections, we will need significantly more reliable electricity generation, including from nuclear energy, in the future. “Nuclear power already provides 20 percent of our nation’s electricity, emissions-free electricity that is on 24/7, 365 days a year. “Electricity demand is projected to increase rapidly in the short term, in part due to the buildout of data centers, when I heard how much power data centers use it astounded me, and increased use of artificial intelligence. “If the Biden administration continues to push an ‘electrify everything’ agenda, from cars to trucks to trains to buildings, electricity demand will rise even faster. “Meanwhile, in the face of increasing power demand, the Biden administration is advancing a radical climate agenda to close down fossil-fuel-fired power plants that supply reliable, affordable electricity. “I have repeatedly raised the flag on this looming threat of increasing demand and decreasing supply since the beginning of this administration. “I most recently raised that flag in an amicus brief and an oversight report from the Committee Republicans, and I will continue to highlight it going forward. It just makes sense to me. “Unless stopped by Congress or the court, the administration’s regulatory attack on the power sector will cause dispatchable, baseload electricity resources to retire prematurely. “This will lead to major reliability challenges and stunt economic development, and increase the costs paid by American families and businesses. “So we should be focusing on increasing, not decreasing, the supply from baseload, reliable power sources. “And increased nuclear deployment should be and must be part of the solution. “That will require the NRC to be prepared to efficiently review and approve novel reactor designs, to enable the safe use of nuclear power, and license a high-volume of applications in a timely, affordable, and predictable way.\\xa0 “The projected increase in the NRC’s workload will overlap with the five-year term that Chairman Hanson has been nominated to serve. “Chair Hanson has supported some important policies since he joined the Commission four years ago. “He supported finalizing the emergency preparedness rules for advanced reactors and correcting a flawed staff proposal to establish a new regulatory framework. “That said, Chair Hanson also made policy decisions that I have some concerns about. “For example, he voted to reverse previous Commission decisions to issue license extensions, a vote that resulted in a cascade of uncertainty for the nuclear industry. We can talk about that in the questioning. “Chair Hanson’s nomination must be judged not only on his policy, but also on his management decisions as Chairman. “The Chairman oversees and supervises the NRC staff’s work, and is responsible for developing policy planning and guidance for consideration by the Commission. “Chair Hanson has a duty to ensure that NRC staff, including the Executive Director for Operations (the EDO), are responsible to the Commission in the performance of its functions. “The Chairman and the EDO, through the Chairman, are responsible for ensuring that the Commission is fully and currently informed about matters within its functions. “The Chairman supervises the development and execution of the Commission’s budget and comes before us once a year to talk about that. “I have concerns with some of the ways that the Commission has been managed in recent years. “Last year senior NRC staff, under the supervision of the Chairman, proposed to drastically expand telework, cutting the required time in office to just four hours per week. “This staff proposal bluntly contradicted the Biden administration’s directive to get federal employees back in the office. “I expressed concern with the staff’s proposal, noting that the likely unintended consequences from reducing personal interaction, both within the NRC staff and between the staff and licensees, applicants, and the public. “The Commission believed that this dramatic departure from in-office culture was a policy matter, and therefore subject to approval by the entire Commission. “This appears to reflect the view that the Commission was not fully informed on the course of the staff’s proposal, as the Chairman is responsible to do. “When presented with the opportunity to directly weigh in on this decision, Chair Hanson doubled down in his support of what I think is an outlandish proposal, breaking with the other three Commissioners. “I appreciate the efforts of the other members of the Commission to reset the staff’s proposal. “We similarly saw the NRC staff present the Commission with a flawed proposed rulemaking to establish the regulatory framework for advanced nuclear reactors, as the chairman [Carper] talked about how critical this is, despite countless public comments that the rule was unworkable. “In this instance, Chair Hanson aligned with the entire Commission to rectify the flaws, and thank you for that, although the senior NRC staff and the Chairman probably should have acted earlier to address the well-documented issues. “I look forward to getting more information from Chair Hanson about his execution of his role to supervise and direct the NRC staff. “We are at a critical time for the nuclear industry, and I appreciate how members across the political spectrum are working together to provide the Commission with the necessary direction and tools to fulfill its mission. “Chairman Carper, Senator Whitehouse, and I continue to work tirelessly to see the Accelerating Deployment of Versatile, Advanced Nuclear for Clean Energy…always have a good name, called the\\xa0ADVANCE Act, signed into law, we got really close at the end of last year, so that America remains the world’s leader in nuclear energy. “As the saying goes, personnel is policy, so as we work to advance these laws, we need to make sure we have the right personnel in place at the NRC. “So I look forward to learning more about Chair Hanson’s plans for the Commission’s work and how he will consider these critical policy matters. “And again thank you for coming and thank you to your family for joining him.” # # # \\nTags: \\nEnergy & Environment\\n',\n",

WASHINGTON, D.C.\\xa0– Today, Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Ranking Member of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, participated in a hearing on the nomination of Christopher Hanson to continue serving on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). During the hearing, Ranking Member Capito\\xa0discussed\\xa0the importance of the NRC working in person to carry out its mission, Chairman Hanson’s record at the NRC, and potential improvements to the NRC’s capacity to more efficiently approve nuclear reactor license applications. HIGHLIGHTS: ON THE IMPORTANCE OF IN-PERSON WORK FOR THE NRC TO CARRY OUT ITS MISSION:\\xa0“You know this is one of my [priorities]…as I mentioned in my opening statement, is the staff telework decision. You select and appoint the Executive Director for Operations. The recommendations, which was to reduce the amount of in-person work at the NRC from the current minimum of two days a week to just four hours per week…I definitely disagree with the track that you’re taking there because I think that's part of the problem you see government-wide is the president is in charge of the government. He makes a statement, ‘everybody should come back to work,’ but nobody's coming back to work. They're not coming back to work full time.” ON HANSON’S RECORD AS NRC CHAIRMAN:\\xa0“You've stated and you restated again that reliability is critical in terms of decision-making because it ensures a level of predictability and certainty. And so you did, despite your statements, you did choose to side with former Commissioner Baran to overturn previously issued license renewals. Your decision ignored extensive staff analysis and justification, multiple previous commission licensing actions, without any new information really being used. The resulting vote occurred solely because two commissioners that had previously been in the majority were no longer on the Commission. How does your vote to reverse previously issued licenses align with your 2020 statements that the NRC must be reliable and predictable, and your statements here again today, in its regulatory action so licensees can act with a minimum of uncertainty in the regulatory arena?” ON GETTING A COMMITMENT TO FIX NRC STAFF’S PROPOSED “ROADMAP” TO INCREASE CAPACITY AND EFFICIENCY: RANKING MEMBER CAPITO: “I'm going to kind of read a statement. I just want to get your commitment that I have this right. It's sort of dealing with some of the things you said previously…In response to direction from the Commission, last week the NRC staff released a roadmap to improve the NRC’s review of subsequent license renewal applications. The roadmap’s goals with respects to timeliness, costs, and number of applications in review are insufficient. I would like a commitment from you, Chair Hanson, that you will direct the staff, utilizing the chairman's authority to direct and supervise the staff, to update the roadmap to achieve an 18-month review schedule with 14,000 staff hours to complete the review and capacity review up to 12 applications at the time. Staff should be prepared to achieve these goals by the end of this calendar year. Is that basically what you said? “ NRC CHAIRMAN HANSON: “I don't know if the 12 applications at a time, senator. I'm not trying to walk that back. I just want to understand from the staff better what their actual capacity is and what a reasonable stretch goal would be in that area. I want them to understand better that the roadmap needs…that\\xa0I'm not satisfied with roadmap and that we need to do better. Certainly I did say 14,000 hours. Again, that seems like a reasonable goal to me. And I think that's something we should shoot for. And again, getting to 18 months before 18 months is also something that I think we should and that I will be engaging with the staff directly on.” Click\\xa0HERE\\xa0to watch Ranking Member Capito’s questions.

       " 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), the vice chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, released the below statement following Senate Democrats’ refusal to hold a full trial to consider the impeachment charges against U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas: “It is the constitutional duty given to the U.S. Senate to try all impeachments. That’s why the Senate has held some form of a trial for every impeachment in our history, unless the federal officer resigned prior to a trial. This time should have been no different. I am disappointed in Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats for their inability to follow the Senate rules. It is truly unprecedented. Even the presiding officer, Democrat Senator Patty Murray, said this move would set a precedent, which could have long-term ramifications. Secretary Mayorkas has repeatedly failed to uphold the law and secure our southern border. The actions by all Democrats to prevent the Senate from holding a trial and hearing evidence is not only unconscionable, it’s a disservice to the American people who elected us to do our jobs and uphold our constitutional duty.” BACKGROUND: Senator Capito has consistently called for Senate Democrats to hold a full trial for Secretary Mayorkas. Recently, she penned an op-ed for the\\xa0Washington Examiner, led a number of her Republican colleagues in a series of Senate floor speeches, and spoke at a Senate Republican Leadership press conference on the subject. Additionally, Senator Capito joined 42 of her Senate Republican colleagues in sending a letter – led by U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) – to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) calling on the Senate to fulfill its constitutional duty by holding a trial to consider the impeachment of Secretary Mayorkas.

       " 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – Yesterday, U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Ranking Member of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, joined a bipartisan group of 33 Senate colleagues to introduce a Congressional Review Act (CRA)\\xa0resolution to overturn the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) radical climate disclosure rule, which would bury public companies in paperwork, raise costs for consumers, and stifle economic opportunity. This effort was led by U.S. Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Ranking Member of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee. “The radical climate disclosure rule set by Chair Gensler and the SEC completely oversteps its authority, will hinder access to capital for energy companies, and will increase energy prices for consumers,” Ranking Member Capito said. “This effort puts environmental activism ahead of sound policymaking in order to achieve left-wing political objectives. I am proud to join Senator Scott and my colleagues in introducing this CRA to overturn this rule.” BACKGROUND: Under Chair Gensler, the SEC has pursued one of the most aggressive regulatory agendas in the agency’s history – with the agency on track to propose and finalize over 60 rules with limited public comment periods and inadequate cost-benefit analyses. Recently in January, Senators Capito and Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) sent a letter to SEC Chair Gensler outlining their objections to the commission’s climate disclosure rule. In the letter, the senators state the proposed rule pushes the Biden administration’s anti-American energy rhetoric, arguing the adoption of this rule hinders domestic energy producers’ access to capital and fuels even higher energy prices.

       " 'WASHINGTON, D.C.\\xa0– Today, U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Ranking Member of the Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, released the below statement following the EPA’s decision to designate two legacy per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), also known as “forever chemicals,” as hazardous substances under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). This constitutes the first time the EPA has ever designated a hazardous substance under CERCLA without first designating the substance as such under another environmental statute. “The EPA’s unprecedented decision today puts local communities and ratepayers on the hook for PFAS contamination they had nothing to do with in the first place. Along with many others in Congress, I have repeatedly warned the EPA about the unintended consequences stemming from this rule, which will have disproportionate impacts on providers of essential public services such as water and waste utilities, airports, farmers and ranchers, and fire departments. “Today’s ill-advised decision underscores the urgent need for Congress to act. We must pass legislation to safeguard American ratepayers from the financial burden imposed by this misguided rule.” CAPITO COMMENTS AT MARCH 2024 EPW HEARING\\xa0ON ISSUES WITH EPA’S POTENTIAL PFAS DESIGNATION UNDER CERCLA: “Communities would be required to remove the six substances, two of which would be hazardous substances, through water treatment processes, therefore concentrating the PFAS in filters.“Water systems could be stuck holding those filters because landfills would be unwilling to accept them due to liability concerns.“Wastewater and storm water utilities, although not responsible for generating these flows, could face similar liabilities, receiving PFAS chemicals through intakes or storm water runoff.“These ‘passive receivers’ would bear the brunt of these liabilities, facing frivolous lawsuits for just providing essential services.“No EPA enforcement discretion policy can prevent lawsuits by activist third parties.“Without congressional action, a wave of lawsuits could potentially raise taxes and utility rates on millions of Americans, all while enriching the trial lawyers.” In 2023, Ranking Member Capito penned an op-ed in Roll Call on the topic, which can be found\\xa0here. # # # \\nTags: \\nEnergy & Environment\\n',\n",
       " \" To watch Senator Capito’s questions, click here or the image above. WASHINGTON, D.C. – This week, U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, and Related Agencies (CJS), questioned U.S. Attorney General (AG) Merrick Garland on the U.S. Department of Justice’s (DOJ) budget request for Fiscal Year (FY) 2025. During her questions, Senator Capito asked AG Garland about issues at Federal Corrections Complex (FCC) Hazelton in Bruceton Mills, W.Va. Senator Capito also asked about portions of the agency’s budget request that deal with the DOJ’s ability to catch deadly fentanyl and prosecute drug dealers. Specifically, Senator Capito referenced a bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Delegation (CODEL) trip to Mexico she took last year that included a meeting with Mexican President López Obrador and members of his administration about stemming the flow of fentanyl at the southern border. HIGHLIGHTS:  ON RESOURCE AND STAFF SHORTAGES AT FCC HAZELTON: SEN. CAPITO: “We wrote a letter to you, a bipartisan letter, Senator Manchin and I. We have quite a few employees at the Hazelton prison that has over 3,000 inmates. A whistleblower came forward with pretty graphic details of mismanagement, abuse, and worse, and it's a chronic problem there because I think lack of workforce and lack of ability to staff up properly. I don't know if you have any reaction to what's going on at Hazelton specifically, or do I need to follow up with you?” AG GARLAND: “We’ll follow up, but this has come to our attention obviously, not only from the letter and, I believe, the actions were taken over the last couple of weeks, but we have more information to you. I think you're right on the problem of recruitment. It's a difficult- it's not only Hazelton, therefore it's difficult to recruit correctional officers. It's a very dangerous job in facilities that have- you know, there has not been the capital investment over the last decades, that’s required, and sometimes state and local facilities not too far away, are offering more money, in terms of salary. So, we have asked for money for our retention and hiring more than the normal salary that we would otherwise be able to pay. That's what the director thinks is going to be necessary to recruit the number of officers necessary to provide safety in our prisons.” ON RESOURCES FOR FENTANYL INTERDICTION: SEN. CAPITO: “We have the most, really, drug related deaths per capita than any other state and most of it is tied to fentanyl. Do you think that the $2.7 billion is an adequate budget for the DEA and how could our resources be better prioritized to reduce, and one day, eliminate the amount of deaths we experienced from fentanyl? Obviously, to stop the flow of fentanyl would be number one, but how would you respond to that?” AG GARLAND: “We would always like more money, but we're obviously trying to live within the caps that were agreed to. I think the budget that we've asked for is a 6% increase over the enacted [bill] for [Fiscal Year] 24, it includes the addition of 40 agents, which will be very helpful. This also includes money for diversion control, which was part of the problem in quite a number of states, with respect to opioids. And then there's the money that we have available in grants with respect to, of course, state and local opioid addiction treatment and protections, so that’s the more than $490 million in counter-drug related [Office of Justice Programs] grants and through the CARE grants and the new grants.” ON COOPERATION WITH MEXICO TO STEM THE FLOW OF FENTANYL AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER: SEN. CAPITO: “We sat in and listened to the President of Mexico basically tell us that ‘you have a demand problem in the United States,’ and we've heard him say this publicly and that because we were imploring him to stop the flow of the chemicals that are coming in from China and then having the development, and production in Mexico, and then flowing into the United States. What is the current state of that disruption or that needed disruption between the Mexican border and the United States in terms of getting the Mexican government to cooperate with our government law enforcement to be able to shut these things down?” AG GARLAND: “Senator, I've sat through that same discussion three times by the President of Mexico, so I'm familiar with your frustration. I would say cooperation was improving, but much, much more is required. They have increased the number of precursor chemicals on their on the list of- are going to have to be registered to come in. They have, at our request, expedited a number of the people who we've indicted: the heads of the Sinaloa Cartel, the ‘Chapitos,’ the sons of El Chapo, they have destroyed labs and, I will say in connection, for example, with the- their arrest of Ovidio, the son of El Chapo, a number of their Mexican Marines lost their lives. They are, you know, they are facing an organization, which, in many ways, has more heavy weaponry than some small countries. So, it's dangerous for them, but it is not sufficient, and that's why I keep going. That's why my Deputy Attorney General keeps going. And that's why law enforcement agencies at all the operational levels keep going, to try to get more cooperation.” # # # \\nTags: \\nHomeland Security, Fighting Drug Epidemic\\n\",\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) led a bipartisan group of senators in sending a letter to President Joe Biden urging him to nominate qualified individuals to the United States International Trade Commission (ITC) to fill the two vacancies and the three seats that have expired, and prepare to fill the one that will expire this year. The ITC plays a crucial role in setting and implementing U.S. trade policy, including by determining whether imports harm domestic industries. “As an independent, nonpartisan agency, the ITC was designed to be governed by an equal number of Democratic and Republican commissioners. The current vacancies and expired terms jeopardize the ability of the ITC to do its job. As the U.S. faces unfair competition in crucial economic industries, it is vital that we have a fully-staffed ITC that puts workers first and truly protects American businesses,” the senators wrote in part. “Personnel is policy, and we look forward to working with you to nominate and confirm qualified individuals to the ITC as quickly as possible.” This letter comes after the ITC’s determination this past February that imports of tin mill products from China, Canada, and Germany do not sufficiently harm the domestic steel industry. The decision directly caused the Cleveland-Cliffs tin mill steel facility in Weirton, W.Va. to announce its closure the following week, resulting in nearly 1,000 employee layoffs, and poses serious risks to domestic manufacturers nationwide. Click here for Senator Capito’s full statement on the determination, as well as other related efforts. The full text of the letter is available below and here. Dear President Biden: We urge you to expeditiously nominate qualified individuals to the United States International Trade Commission (ITC) to fill the two vacancies and the three seats that have expired and prepare to fill the one that will expire this year. The ITC plays a crucial role in setting and implementing U.S. trade policy, including by investigating and determining whether imports injure a domestic industry or violate U.S. property rights. As an independent, nonpartisan agency, the ITC was designed to be governed by an equal number of Democratic and Republican commissioners. The current vacancies and expired terms jeopardize the ability of the ITC to do its job. As the U.S. faces unfair competition in crucial economic industries, it is vital that we have a fully-staffed ITC that puts workers first and truly protects American businesses. Eyeing the interconnected system of global commerce that would define the twentieth century, President Woodrow Wilson worked with Congress in 1916 to create the ITC to enact tariff policies that were in the best interests of American workers. In describing the need for an ITC, President Wilson said: “the sweep of [economic] change has been so universal that an unprejudiced, nonpartisan board is absolutely necessary,” particularly if “America is going to be thrust out into the economic leadership of the world.” If we are to maintain this economic leadership, we must use all of our trade enforcement tools to allow American workers and businesses to compete fairly. This begins with nominating and confirming quality candidates for the vacancies on the ITC. A fully-staffed ITC stands a better chance of fulfilling its mission to provide relief to American industries from illegal foreign trade practices. Personnel is policy, and we look forward to working with you to nominate and confirm qualified individuals to the ITC as quickly as possible. Thank you for your consideration of this important issue. We look forward to your response. # # # \\nTags: \\nEconomy\\n',\n",
       " 'On April 13, the Iranian regime carried out a massive, unprecedented attack against Israel using drones, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles. I’m glad the attack was largely thwarted, but I can’t imagine how terrifying it must have been for Israeli families. I will continue to keep them in my prayers during these dangerous times. While the Iranian regime has previously relied on its network of terror groups to attack Israel, this was the first time it has carried out a strike from its own soil against our most important ally in the Middle East. And it’s no coincidence that the attack occurred at a time when Israel’s support from the Biden administration is waning and after years of failed policies that have emboldened Iran.  There is no question in my mind that this attack would not have happened if former President Donald Trump was in office. Under Trump, the U.S. was feared by our enemies and respected by our allies. The Trump administration’s maximum pressure campaign against Iran was incredibly effective, whether it was scrapping the Iran Nuclear Deal, hitting Iran in its pocketbook with tough sanctions, or greenlighting a precision air strike to take out Iranian Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani – the leader of the regime’s worldwide terrorist efforts. Unfortunately, Biden scrapped Trump’s maximum pressure campaign and replaced it with policies that have only emboldened Iran. It’s not just Biden’s policies that have emboldened Iran. It’s also his weak rhetoric and unacceptable criticism of Israel’s handling of its war against evil terrorists. Biden’s so-called warning to Iran just a day before the attack was a single message: \"Don’t.\" And in the days following the attack, Biden and world leaders urged Israel to just “take the win” and not retaliate because the strikes caused minimal damage. They have no business dictating the terms of Israel’s response to a direct attack on their nation. And on the evening of April 18, Israel responded appropriately to Iran’s attack by taking out military targets in an effort to defend itself and discourage the regime from carrying out another attack.  What Israel needs right now more than ever is strong support from its allies. But since the October 7th terrorist attack, Washington Democrats have become increasingly critical of Israel and its war against the terrorists who carried out the worst massacre of the Jewish people since the Holocaust. The Left has called on Israel to agree to an immediate ceasefire without conditions for having their hostages returned home. They’ve demanded the U.S. cutoff military aid to Israel. They’ve called on Israel to host new elections in an effort to oust its prime minister. It’s absolutely unacceptable.\\xa0  House Republicans are fighting back. In direct response to the April 13 attack, we advanced numerous measures to support Israel and hold the evil Iranian regime and its terror proxies accountable. We passed a bill to revoke the tax-exempt status of terrorist-supporting organizations, an effort I’ve helped lead as Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. We also advanced a resolution condemning Iran\\'s attack and reaffirming support for Israel. In addition, the House passed several bills aimed at strengthening sanctions on Iran, the number one state-sponsor of terror in the world.  Israel is one of our strongest allies and closest friends. Whether it’s providing weapons, aid, or intelligence, the U.S. must ensure Israel has the resources it needs to defend itself and keep its people safe. I will ALWAYS stand with Israel, and I will continue pushing this administration to do what’s right and abandon its policies that are emboldening Iran.\\xa0 ',\n",

       " 'Text of Letter to DoorDash (PDF) | Text of Letter to UberEats (PDF) Washington, D.C. – United States Senators Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Bob Casey (D-Penn.) wrote to DoorDash and UberEats, the two largest delivery platforms, calling out their use of hidden junk fees to take advantage of American consumers trying to put food on the table while balancing busy schedules. UberEats and DoorDash have taken advantage of consumers, who are relying more and more on delivery services to put food on the table while balancing difficult work schedules, caring for young children or elderly parents, and other obstacles, creating an opportunity for these delivery platforms to tack on confusing and unexplained fees, which can triple order prices in some cases.\\xa0\\xa0 American families are struggling with high food prices, and research shows that in many cases, corporate actions such as price gouging and shrinkflation are to blame. Big food companies used the supply chain shocks of the pandemic and recent inflation as a cover for raising their prices far higher than their increase in production costs. In recent years, consumers spent more than 11 percent of their disposable income on food.\\xa0 Restaurants and stores often increase their listed prices to offset the huge fees that delivery platforms charge them for using their service, which can sometimes go up to 30 percent. Delivery platforms then add extra fees for delivery and other services to the existing markup. Fees can vary depending on location, distance, the number of items ordered, the amount of available delivery drivers, and general demand in the order area. While these fees can start off as small dollar amounts and percentages of an order subtotal, they quickly add up and the total markup on a food delivery order (before tip) can be as high as 95 percent. Worse, customers often cannot see the fees until just before paying, meaning a large portion of the total cost of ordering is hidden from customers until there is only one button left to press.\\xa0 Platforms often provide insufficient explanations for where their service and delivery fees go, and the fees can sometimes cost more than the order itself.\\xa0 While these companies continue to squeeze customers with hidden fees, they continue to line the pockets of executives and shareholders. Instead of reinvesting revenue in delivery workers’ compensation or cutting down frivolous fees for consumers, both companies announced stock buybacks this year. In February 2024, DoorDash announced a $1.1 billion round of stock buybacks. In March 2024, UberEats initiated a $7 billion stock buyback. In 2020, DoorDash went public and had the highest-paid CEO in Silicon Valley, with a total compensation of nearly $413 million. Last year, Uber posted a full-year profit for the first time since going public in 2019 and paid its CEO more than $24 million.\\xa0 Notably, this is not the first congressional investigation into DoorDash’s and UberEats’ fee structure. Senator Luján wrote to both companies last year about their high consumer fees and lack of transparency. The delivery companies’ responses offer little clarity on customer fee structure.\\xa0\\xa0 The lawmakers are requesting information about every type of fee or service charge the delivery platforms currently charge and their tie to executive compensation by May 15, 2024.\\xa0',\n",

Markey (D-Mass.), and Senator Blumenthal led their colleagues in a letter to Sophie Shulman, the Acting Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, today urging the agency to take more proactive and aggressive action to address the safety concerns of partially automated and fully automated driving systems. This letter is the latest in the Senators’ ongoing efforts to push auto manufacturers and regulating agencies to take seriously the dangers of partially automated and automated driving systems. These driving systems, which are becoming increasingly common, present a long list of safety concerns at a time when roadway deaths are already too high. After several high-profile crashes involving both partially automated and automated driving systems, NHTSA has initiated several investigations, but has not taken further proactive steps to make these systems safe enough for U.S. roads. \\xa0 Cosigners in the Senate include Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and Peter Welch (D-Vt.). The letter is also endorsed by the Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the Transport Workers Union, and the Center for Auto Safety. \\xa0 In their letter, the senators wrote, “We cannot allow partially automated driving systems and automated driving systems to accelerate the road safety crisis. NHTSA must take firm control of the wheel and steer manufacturers towards prioritizing safety.”\\xa0\\xa0 The senators continued, “Public roads are not a sandbox for manufacturers or operators to play in, and regulatory agencies like NHTSA should be highly cautious about providing lax pathways onto the road for dangerous vehicles.”\\xa0 Specifically, the letter urges NHTSA to consider several policy actions that would make autonomous vehicles safer, including:\\xa0\\xa0 ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Restrict driving systems to the roads they are designed for – partially automated and automated driving systems are designed only for certain road environments, but some manufacturers allow these systems to be engaged anywhere.\\xa0\\xa0 ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Investigate confusing marketing that misleads drivers – partially automated driving systems are sometimes marketed as automated driving systems, leading to dangerous situations where drivers misunderstand the driving system’s capability.\\xa0\\xa0 ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Explore requiring more robust data collection – vehicle manufactures are required to provide crash data to NHTSA for certain crashes, but this data is often incomplete and insufficient to inform potential regulatory safety actions.\\xa0\\xa0 ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Consider proactive standards to make autonomous vehicles safer — outside of the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards that every vehicle must comply with, there is no additional safety standard partially automated and automated driving systems must meet to ensure the vehicles are safe enough for public roads.\\xa0\\xa0 ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Regulate remote assistance operators – Many automated driving systems rely on remote assistance operators to monitor the driving system, but there are no standards governing the credentials, location, or responsibilities of these operators.\\xa0\\xa0 ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Exercise significant caution before exempting autonomous vehicles from existing safety standards – some reports indicate NHTSA is considering a pilot program to allow more vehicles equipped with automated driving systems on the road.\\xa0\\xa0',\n",
       " 'Bipartisan Bill Would Create Career Pathways to Tackle Growing Wildfire Threats Washington,\\xa0D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) and U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) introduced the Regional Leadership in Wildland Fire Research Act to establish regional research centers at institutions of higher education across the country. Under this bipartisan legislation, these regional centers would be tasked with developing next-generation fire and vegetation models and technologies to support the wildland fire management community in their mission, and address the specific needs of the region they are situated in. According to the U.S. Fire Administration, current wildfire models are failing to adequately predict fire behavior under extreme conditions and in more complex environments. These models also struggle to reproduce recent catastrophic wildfires, making them more likely to fail at predicting future wildfires or determining when and where it is safe to conduct prescribed burns. To support effective wildland fire management and prepare firefighters against evolving risks, next-generation fire and vegetation models are needed. Each regional research center will: Additionally, this bill will establish a National Center Coordination Board to coordinate the work of centers, and establish Regional Advisory Boards from wildfire management agencies, state and Tribal governments, and other stakeholders to provide input and assistance. “Far too many communities in New Mexico and in states across the country know that wildfire season can cost you everything, from homes to small businesses. The federal government must do everything possible to understand the root causes of these wildfires and how local communities can improve wildfire mitigation efforts and save lives and livelihoods,” said Senator Luján. “I’m proud to lead this bipartisan legislation to establish regional research centers tasked with developing next-generation fire and vegetation models and technologies. Each of these regional centers will help boost wildland fire management across the country while creating more opportunities for a good-paying job through career training for wildfire research.” “Wildfires burn millions of acres in Alaska every year—sometimes as much or more than the combined acreage burned in the rest of the country,” said Senator Sullivan. “To better protect lives, homes and critical infrastructure, we need to invest in research that will produce more accurate models and empower our wildland firefighters to better predict and extinguish fires before they become full-scale natural disasters. I’m glad to introduce legislation with Senator Lujan to establish wildland fire research centers at our universities with specialized expertise in this space—like UAF in Interior Alaska—and develop more effective firefighting strategies that respond to the unique circumstances of each of our states.” The bill is supported by the Geological Society of America, Federation of American Scientists, National Federation of Federal Employees, Forest Stewards Guild, The Nature Conservancy, the University of New Mexico, and the University of Alaska Fairbanks. “We need research and innovation to respond to the challenge of larger and more severe wildfires. Fire Research Centers can respond to questions from managers and firefighters about how to mitigate and respond to the unprecedent wildfire behavior they face,” said Dr. Zander Evans, Executive Director, Forest Stewards Guild. “Growing populations in hazard-prone locations, the interconnection of modern economies, and climate change are increasing the risks associated with natural hazards, including wildfires. Thus, it is important for scientists who study the causes and impacts of these hazards to collaborate with policymakers, stakeholders, and professionals from a variety of disciplines to develop and implement policies that mitigate adverse outcomes and foster resilience from natural hazards. The regional research centers established through this act will play a crucial role in advancing our understanding of wildfire behavior, mitigation strategies, and ecosystem resilience, ultimately aiding in the protection of both human lives and natural landscapes, and the Geological Society of America welcomes Senator Luján’s leadership on this issue,” said Dr. Christopher Bailey, President of The Geological Society of America and Chair of the Geology Department at The College of William & Mary. “The University of New Mexico stands in strong support of this legislation sponsored by Senator Ben Ray Luján and Senator Dan Sullivan, seeking to improve existing models of wildland fire risk and build new, improved forecasts of wildfire susceptibility.\\xa0UNM, along with our state and federal partners, acknowledges the critical function this legislation will serve as we aim to provide more accurate information to land managers and firefighters who share our interest in protecting our local communities and forested watersheds, preserving rural livelihoods and sustaining agricultural economies in New Mexico for future generations,” said Garnett S. Stokes, President, The University of New Mexico. “Approximately 80% of Alaska’s population is living in areas at risk of wildland fire. It is vital that we improve our understanding of and develop better ways to prevent and combat wildland fire on a regional basis. The best way to accomplish these goals is through regional research efforts. I’m grateful Senator Sullivan recognizes this and thankful for his leadership and introduction of the Regional Leadership in Wildland Fire Research Act. UAF stands ready to advance wildland fire regional research to help protect lives and property in Alaska. I also want to thank Senator Luján for partnering with Senator Sullivan on this important legislation,” said Dr. Dan White, Chancellor of the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF). “Extreme weather has pushed wildfires to grow in size and severity, making our current wildfire models inadequate. The\\xa0Regional Leadership in Wildland Fire Research Act\\xa0is a significant investment in understanding how wildland fire risks continue to evolve, and establishes a strong foundation that first responders and forest managers can rely on,”\\xa0said Daniel Correa, Chief Executive Officer of the Federation of American Scientists.\\xa0“We commend Senator Luján and Senator Sullivan for their leadership to champion and invest in innovative next-generation fire and vegetation models to protect human health, ecosystems, and our communities.” “We spend billions on improving our understanding of disasters like hurricanes and tornadoes – that hasn’t happened yet with megafire. The\\xa0Regional Leadership in Wildland Fire Research Act\\xa0recognizes and invests in our research community to produce region specific scientific research and solutions to catastrophic wildfires, allowing innovators and wildland firefighters to use this information to directly leverage technology to predict, detect, and prevent megafire,”\\xa0said Matt Weiner, CEO of Megafire Action.

This legislation prohibits federal funding of NPR and prevents local public radio stations from using federal grant money to purchase content or pay dues to NPR.  “It is bad enough that so many media outlets push their slanted views instead of reporting the news, but it is even more egregious for hardworking taxpayers to be forced to pay for it. National Public Radio has a track record of promoting anti-American narratives on the taxpayer dime,” said Good. “My legislation would ensure no taxpayer dollars are used to fund the woke, leftist propaganda of National Public Radio.”  NPR was originally created to be an educational news source and to “speak with many voices, many dialects.” In the 55 years since NPR was founded, they have become a primary outlet for advancing biased and radical media coverage of political and social issues. On April 10, 2024, former Editor of NPR, Uri Berliner, issued a scathing review of the news outlet claiming it has “lost America’s trust.” Mr. Berliner resigned from NPR shortly after due to a lack of viewpoint diversity and a hard embrace of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) principles.

       " 'Washington, DC – U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) and Representative Mary Sattler Peltola (D-Alaska) today applauded the announcement that the Air National Guard will delay the implementation of full-time leveling actions in the state of Alaska that would impact or eliminate nearly 80 Active Guard Reserve positions and threaten the United States homeland defense mission in Alaska and beyond. The delay moves implementation from October 1, 2024 to September 30, 2025, allowing for the Air National Guard to complete a more comprehensive assessment of the impact the proposed changes will have on critical Alaska missions, and decide whether the proposed changes should occur at all. The delay will provide reprieve for the members assigned to Alaska Guard missions that include missile warning, air refueling, and combat rescue. Senator Murkowski met with Air National Guard members in February to hear about the impact of the proposed cuts to their livelihoods. “While I am very encouraged by today’s news, this entire exercise was unacceptable,” said Senator Lisa Murkowski. “The strain this uncertainty put on Alaska Air National Guard members – who Alaskans depend on in the most dire of emergencies – for them to worry about their jobs, their benefits, their ability to provide for their families, is unacceptable. Delaying the implementation of the misguided directives is a win – but it should never have come to this. I will remain engaged in this issue to ensure that our Alaska Air National Guard remains operational and supported at the fullest extent, into 2025 and beyond.” “When I heard about the National Guard’s proposed, ill-advised cuts, my team and I demanded meetings with\\xa0National Guard\\xa0Bureau\\xa0senior leadership, including the Director of the Air National Guard,”\\xa0said Senator Dan Sullivan. “During those meetings, we explained that Alaska’s National Guard is composed of highly skilled\\xa0service members who respond to state emergencies, conduct combat search-and-rescue missions, execute air and missile defense missions, support space domain awareness, and serve as a critical link in the defense of the American homeland. These missions are unique in the nation given Alaska’s strategic location and require\\xa0National\\xa0Guard members to be on alert 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. These cuts would have undermined not only our state’s security, but our national security as well. While I am heartened by the decision to delay these misguided cuts until October 2025, I will continue to work relentlessly on this issue to keep Alaska National Guard positions secure.” “Alaska’s Air National Guard plays an essential role in defending our homeland and in ensuring Alaskans’ health and safety,” said Representative Mary Peltola. “This proposal would damage the United States’ ability to project power in the Far North, reduce vital search and rescue capabilities, and push Alaskans out of service to their state and their country.

       " \"Washington, DC – U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan (both R-Alaska) and Representative Mary Sattler Peltola (D-Alaska) today slammed President Biden and his administration for making two more major adversarial decisions—on top of dozens of others over the past three years—that will prevent responsible resource development in Alaska. Earlier today, the Department of the Interior (DOI) released a Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) for the Ambler Access Project (AAP), selecting the “no action” alternative to deny the project’s re-approval. Federal law provides for the AAP—which was previously approved in 2020—to provide access to the Ambler Mining District, state-owned lands with significant deposits of copper, cobalt, gallium, germanium, and other critical minerals that are crucial to the U.S. economy and national security. DOI also finalized its “Proposed Rule for Management and Protection of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska (NPR-A).” The final rule prohibits leasing and infrastructure development on millions of acres of the petroleum reserve and threatens access to millions more. This is again contrary to federal law, which requires an expeditious program of leasing and development.\\xa0 “The Biden administration may be focused on short-term political gains, but at the expense of Alaska’s long-term future, limiting jobs for Alaskans, revenues for our state, and the future energy and mineral security of our nation,” Senator Murkowski said. “Once again, the President and his team are making unjustifiable decisions that hurt us while allowing some of the worst regimes in the world—in nations like Iran and Russia—to stay in power, enrich themselves from resource production, and then use those revenues to finance terror and war. At this point, the Biden administration is undermining the rule of law, ignoring the voices of Alaska Natives, and punishing Alaska despite our strong environmental record. I will work with Dan and Mary to overturn these decisions any way we can—whether in Congress, the courts, or the next administration.” “The Biden administration sanctions Alaskans, while terrorists in Iran and communists in China get off scot-free and are strengthened. It's no wonder, with such anti-American policies, that authoritarian regimes in Russia, China and Iran are on the march,” said Senator Sullivan. “The Biden administration is deliberately undertaking policies to punish Americans and undermine our strengths while continuing to help our adversaries. Shutting down two of the world's most important energy and critical mineral developments in our country sends this message to the dictators in Iran, China and Russia: We won't use our resources to strengthen America, but we’ll become more dependent on yours. In their statements, both President Biden and Interior Secretary Haaland say they’re taking such actions after extensive consultation and to ‘[safeguard] the way of life’ for Alaska Natives. These statements are flat out lies. This decision goes against the strong opposition of the elected Alaska Native leaders from the North Slope Borough region—whose voices throughout this process have been canceled. In fact, the elected Indigenous leaders from the North Slope of Alaska have flown 4,000 miles to D.C. eight times, requesting a meeting with Interior Secretary Haaland to express their vehement opposition to the administration’s new NPR-A rule. Each time, they were denied a meeting. The truth of what’s going on here is that Joe Biden is listening to and taking direction from far-left Lower 48 eco-colonialists who don’t give a damn about the Indigenous people of the North Slope of Alaska and who Joe Biden believes he needs for his reelection. Like the dictators in Moscow, Tehran and Beijing, these eco-colonialists are overjoyed about this decision, while the Alaska Native people who’ve lived in the North Slope region for thousands of years are despondent, discouraged and deeply offended.” “Closing off NPR-A is a huge step back for Alaska, failing to strike a balance between the need for gap oil and natural gas and legitimate environmental concerns, and steamrolling the voices of many Alaska Natives in the decision-making process,” said Representative Peltola. “The Ambler Road decision is premature, as real conversations among stakeholders in the region are ongoing. Alaska has a wealth of natural resources that can be responsibly developed to help boost domestic manufacturing and innovation—in the end, it should be up to Alaskans to decide what they want developed in their regions.” Background:  Ambler Access Project: The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) of 1980 guarantees a right-of-way (ROW) across federal lands to provide road access to the Ambler Mining District. Federal permitting for the AAP began in 2015—during the Obama administration—and included a rigorous environmental and economic analysis (EEA). After holding 18 public meetings and considering over 3,000 unique public comments, in July 2020, the Secretaries of the Interior and Transportation signed a joint Record of Decision (ROD) selecting the Northern Alignment as the approved route for the road. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the National Park Service later issued a 50-year ROW permit for the AAP. In February 2022, DOI sought a voluntary court remand to conduct an SEIS for the AAP. The very same day, President Biden held a roundtable on “Securing Critical Minerals for a Future Made in America”—failing to recognize the Ambler Mining District is one of the nation’s best options to produce them, but foreshadowing his administration’s incoherence on this issue. The court agreed to DOI’s narrow remand request in May 2022, but placed conditions on it to ensure it would move forward expeditiously. The Alaska Delegation has repeatedly urged DOI to re-approve the AAP, including through a letter sent in December 2023. As explained in that letter, the AAP would provide access known deposits of copper, cobalt, gallium, germanium, and other needed minerals. Alaska’s Petroleum Reserve: Congress set the NPR-A aside in 1923 for oil and gas development. In 1980, Congress amended the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act to direct the Secretary of the Interior to “conduct an expeditious program of competitive leasing” in the area. During the Obama-Biden administration, companies were encouraged to develop in the petroleum reserve, as opposed to other parts of Alaska. On September 8, 2023, DOI proposed to cut off access to millions of acres within the NPR-A, by suddenly and dramatically reinterpreting the law so that it can treat 13.1 million acres of Special Areas in the NPR-A as de facto federal wilderness. In October 2023, the Alaska Delegation requested an 80-day extension to the comment deadline for BLM’s proposed rule, citing DOI’s lack of meaningful consultation with communities and stakeholders on the North Slope. The Delegation sent another letter shortly thereafter, outlining deficiencies in the SEIS, and another in April 2024, again urging DOI to withdraw its misguided and unlawful rule. While taking dramatic steps to limit resource development in Alaska, the Biden administration has relaxed sanctions on Iran and Venezuela and failed to enforce an international price cap on Russian oil—allowing all three regimes to enrich themselves. The Indigenous elected leaders of Alaska’s North Slope published statements today expressing their outrage at the Biden administration’s decision to advance its September 2023 Proposed NPR-A Rule. ### 510 L Street\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSuite 600\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAnchorage, AK  99501\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPhone: (907) 271-3735\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFax: (877) 857-0322 800 Glacier Ave\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSuite 101\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJuneau, AK  99801\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPhone: (907) 586-7277\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFax: (877) 857-0322 851 E.

The letter is supported by the\\xa0Association of American Railroads\\xa0(AAR)\\xa0and the\\xa0American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association\\xa0(ASLRRA). \\xa0\\xa0 Full text of the letter can be found\\xa0here\\xa0and below: Dear Administrator Regan: On April 27, 2023, the California Air Resources Board (CARB), the air regulator for the State of California, finalized a regulation aimed at reducing emissions in the rail sector. The In-Use Locomotive Regulation (the “Regulation”) would impose significant operational and financial burdens on freight railroads operating in California, including both Class I’s and short line railroads. In order to go into full effect, the Regulation requires the EPA to issue a waiver pursuant to section 209 of the Clean Air Act (CAA) (42 U.S.C. 7543(e)). As the EPA considers this waiver request from CARB, we request that the EPA fully considers the limitations on the authority granted to it under the Clean Air Act and the broad impacts that such an approval would have on rail operations in California and across the United States, Canada, and Mexico. As you are aware, beginning in 2030, the Regulation prohibits the operation in California of locomotives more than 23 years after its original manufacture date unless those locomotives operate in a zero-emissions configuration - technology that is not commercially available today. The Regulation also requires railroads to open and deposit funds into ‘spending accounts’ based on the emissions and energy consumption of each non-zero-emissions locomotive operating in California. These funds could only be utilized by the railroads to purchase these new, zero- emissions locomotives or to invest in the requisite infrastructure and demonstration projects associated with zero-emissions locomotives. The spending account provision of the Regulation would result in onerous financial constraints on railroads in California, with some estimates suggesting that the two Class I railroads with operations in California would each have to deposit approximately $800 million annually into such accounts. Finally, the Regulation imposes strict idling requirements on the railroads as well as stringent recordkeeping requirements by mandating that every instance of idling longer than thirty minutes be reported along with the reason for idling that length of time.\\xa0 The national rail network is an interconnected system of over 144,000 track miles that spans the United States, Canada, and Mexico. It is for that very reason that Congress has passed laws which unequivocally state that, as an intrinsically interstate form of transportation, the rail industry must be regulated at the federal level and not subjected to a patchwork of varying state and local regulations as trains move goods across the continent. Attempts to create state-specific operational rules, such as those envisioned by CARB, would jeopardize the interoperability of the national network and would threaten the overall health of the supply chain. CARB has stated its goal is to force the railroads to convert their national fleets to the currently unavailable and untested zero-emission locomotives. The CAA does not grant EPA the authority to allow states to mandate specifications for the design and manufacture of locomotives – which is precisely what CARB seeks in its authorization request. CARB’s authorization request, therefore, violates the restrictions laid out in the CAA. Section 209(e)(1) of the CAA clearly prohibits California or any other state from attempting to regulate emissions from new engines used in locomotives. Despite EPA’s misguided effort last year to remove regulatory preemption language, EPA is bound by the statutory language in section 209 when determining whether to issue a waiver. By forcing railroads to adopt new zero-emissions locomotives for their operations in California, CARB clearly goes beyond the parameters of section 209(e)(2) by attempting to change the fleet nationwide to new, zero-emissions locomotives. Rail transportation remains the most fuel-efficient mode of transporting freight by land. A single locomotive can move one ton of freight 500 miles on a single gallon of fuel and can pull the equivalent freight of nearly 100 trucks. Railroads represent less than two percent of all transportation-sector greenhouse gas emissions, less than one tenth of the greenhouse gas emissions from the tucking sector. Approval of CARB’s authorization request could inadvertently increase overall emissions by forcing more shippers to utilize trucks as opposed to rail-based transportation. If the EPA were to approve CARB’s authorization request, the results would be devastating for the rail industry and, subsequently, the economy as a whole. Under section 209(e)(2), other states would be able to follow California’s lead and adopt identical standards, further disrupting the uniform regulatory landscape. In addition, the financial strain the spending account requirement of the Regulation would place on railroads could be multiplied across each other state that chooses to adopt the Regulation. Finally, the EPA’s actions could jeopardize the supply chain by forcing railroads to utilize largely unproven technology to power the locomotives. The technology will also need to be evaluated by the Federal Railroad Administration to determine any safety concerns. Although railroads are currently investing in the research and development needed to commercialize zero emissions technology, that technology is years away from commercial viability. It is for these reasons that we request the EPA carefully consider the environmental, supply chain, and modal shift implications that EPA approving CARB’s waiver request would have. The economy depends on the timely, efficient, and predictable movement of goods that is facilitated by the railroads. California has failed to demonstrate the extraordinary circumstances needed to satisfy the requirements of their waiver request. And if the EPA concludes that the Regulation would substantially change the design of future locomotives in use in California and across the country, the EPA must deny the given that EPA has no authority to waive the preemptive provisions of section 209(e)(1). -###-',\n",

Hoeven has been making the case for the Senate to fulfill its constitutional duty by holding a trial to consider the impeachment articles, however Senate Democrats instead blocked efforts to hold a trial and voted to dismiss the articles of impeachment. “Secretary Mayorkas needs to be held responsible for failing to uphold the law and secure the border. Under oath, he has repeatedly refused to admit that there is a crisis at our southern border and instead sought to mislead Congress regarding the Biden administration’s policies, while obfuscating his responsibility to uphold our immigration laws and ensure our borders are secure,” said Hoeven. “The record increase of illegal crossings at the southern border poses a threat to U.S. national security, and is directly linked to his willful and systemic refusal to comply with the law, and resulting breach of public trust. We must hold him accountable.” Hoeven, along with 42 other senators, made the case for the Senate to fulfill its constitutional duty by holding a trial to consider the impeachment articles.

       " 'WASHINGTON – Senator John Hoeven, a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, issued the following statement opposing the Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM) final Public Lands Rule that seeks to overhaul the management of more than 245 million acres of taxpayer-owned lands. The rule would establish “conservation leases” that would lock away federal lands in conflict with the longstanding tradition of multiple use requirements established by Congress. Hoeven and Senator John Barrasso, Ranking Member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, will introduce a Congressional Review Act resolution of disapproval to repeal the rule. “Congress has mandated that taxpayer-owned lands be available for grazing, energy production, recreation and other uses, which is particularly important in North Dakota and other western states that depend on access to federal lands,” said Hoeven. “The Biden administration’s public lands rule would lock away federal lands in direct conflict with the longstanding multiple use law, which is why Senator Barrasso and I will introduce legislation to stop this onerous rule.” After BLM issued the proposed rule last year, Hoeven submitted language to the Interior Appropriations Bill prohibiting the use of funds to further develop, implement or enforce the rule, and led a Congressional comment letter opposing the rule and asking that it be withdrawn. -###-',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON – Senator John Hoeven, a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources (ENR) Committee, this week joined his Senate Republican colleagues in pushing back on Biden administration policies that are handcuffing U.S. oil production. The senator stressed that by restricting production of taxpayer-owned minerals and increasing the cost of domestic energy production, President Biden is undermining the economic and national security of the U.S. and its allies. This leads to greater reliance on energy from adversaries like Iran, Venezuela and Russia, which have lower environmental standards than the U.S. Moreover, the Biden administration has failed to enforce sanctions on Iran, including Iranian oil exports, which has enabled the regime in Tehran to continue funding terrorist groups, such as Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis in Yemen. Accordingly, Hoeven is working to provide regulatory relief for U.S. energy production and unlock the potential of America’s abundant energy resources, including its vast oil, gas and coal reserves. At the same time, the senator is pressing the Biden administration to reinstate a policy of maximum pressure on Iran and enforce sanctions without waivers. “This is about the cost to U.S. consumers and the rising inflation that results when we can’t produce energy here at home, the small businesses hurt by the Biden administration’s policies and, ultimately, our national security,” said Hoeven. “When Iran attacks Israel, where do they get the funding for those drones and missiles? It comes from energy and selling oil. The Biden administration policies don’t even benefit the environment, because when Russia, Iran or Venezuela produce this energy, it is done with the worst environmental standards, whereas the U.S. has the best. There is no common sense to these policies in any way, shape or form. They hurt every single American, every single day, and our allies as well.” Among other efforts, Hoeven is working to: -###-',\n",

       " \"WASHINGTON - At a House Financial Services Committee hearing today, U.S. Representative Juan Vargas (CA-52), co-chair of the Congressional Sustainable Investment Caucus, voiced support for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) recently finalized climate disclosure rule. “The SEC’s climate rule is about standardizing the climate related disclosures publicly traded companies must make so that regular people invested in the market can have access to the same information that businesses already are spending roughly $500,000 a year to access,” said Rep. Vargas. “Giving people more information is a good thing, not a bad thing.” “If you're a teacher, or a firefighter, or anyone that's working to earn a retirement for yourself and your family, because of this rule, you will have more information to help you decide which companies to trust with your hard-earned savings,” Rep. Vargas continued.\\xa0 Last week, Rep. Vargas held a press conference with Rep. Sean Casten (IL-06) to underscore the need for the SEC’s climate disclosure rule.\\xa0 Last year, Reps. Vargas and Casten founded the Congressional Sustainable Investment Caucus to create a forum to protect Americans’ freedom to invest while increasing the information available to market participants about the risks posed by climate change. Rep. Vargas’s Corporate Governance Improvement and Investor Protection Act, which passed the House in the 117th Congress, encouraged corporations to address important issues such as climate change and worker rights by requiring the SEC to create standard definitions for environmental and social responsibility metrics. The bill also included language from Rep. Casten’s Climate Risk Disclosure Act that required public companies to disclose additional information about their exposure to climate-related risks.\\xa0 A rough transcript of Rep. Vargas’s remarks is below.\\xa0 Rep. Vargas: The SEC’s climate rule is about standardizing the climate related disclosures publicly traded companies must make so that regular people invested in the market can have access to the same information that businesses already are spending roughly $500,000 a year to access. Giving people more information is a good thing, not a bad thing.\\xa0 The reality is that climate change isn't just a threat to our planet, it's also a threat to our financial systems. Wildfires, floods, and hurricanes, and the risk of future climate disasters have a significant impact on families’ financial well-being. These are not far-left radicals. These are firefighters, these are police officers, these are teachers, these are regular investors, these are… everybody in our country, we want to know this information.\\xa0 In fact, interestingly, this week, I was able to talk to some insurers, because they are having a difficult time insuring homes in California because of climate change, because of the wildfires. They’re not far-left radicals. These are people that want this information because they invest.\\xa0 If you're a teacher, or a firefighter, or anyone that's working to earn a retirement for yourself and your family, because of this rule, you will have more information to help you decide which companies to trust with your hard-earned savings.\\xa0 In issuing this rule, the SEC has remained true to the agency's mission to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets and facilitate capital formation. Climate change also impacts anyone who has money invested in the market, including many, as I said, teachers, firefighters, with a pension, anyone who puts money away for a retirement account.\\xa0 So I appreciate very much what the SEC has done here. And talking about transparency and talking about giving people the opportunity to take a look at this rule and to comment, it was an enormous amount of time, back and forth. And I think that they did a very good job.\\xa0 Obviously, there's some of us that wished the rule would have gotten further… Scope Three information. But you know what, I think this is a very good start. So I applaud the SEC. I applaud them for what they've done there. It's clearly within their mandate, clearly opportunity is here to give information to investors that want this information. And I applaud them for what they do.\\xa0 Lastly, I would say this, there has been this notion of denying climate change for many, many decades. And finally, people are understanding that this is real. It has real impacts on our country and throughout the world.\\xa0 ###\",\n",

We need to end the status quo of police brutality and mass incarceration, and channel massive investments into systems of care, not criminalization, that are rooted in improving the safety and well-being of all communities,” said Congresswoman Cori Bush. “One of my greatest privileges continues to be bringing this movement from the streets to the halls of Congress. And that is exactly the intention behind the People’s Response Act. Congress must move to pass this lifesaving legislation.” “The over-criminalization of our K-12 schools is not just an inequity — it is a crisis in and of itself. So we must be intentional about confronting it head on and advancing policies and budgets that promote trauma-informed learning environments where our students can learn free from fear,\" said Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley. \"I\\'m proud to see critical legislation like the Counseling Not Criminalization in Schools Act gain the support of this broad coalition. Congress must pass this bill and we must continue working to dismantle systems of oppression in America wherever they exist.\" “One in five fatal police shootings ends the life of a person with mental illness. This is unacceptable,” said Rep. Katie Porter. “I’m proud that more than 110 of my colleagues are again supporting my bipartisan Mental Health Justice Act, which would provide grants to hire, train, and dispatch mental health responders to people in crisis. Having the right type of responders for mental health emergencies will save lives, make our communities safer, reduce the strain on our criminal justice system, and stop distracting law enforcement from fighting crime. Congress should get this bill across the finish line.” “We are proud to be supporters of the People’s Response Act, which puts humanity first by emphasizing an inclusive, holistic, and health-centered approach to public safety. More police, and more funding for police will not keep our communities safe. Despite the evidence that punitive interventions make us less safe, we continue to see more and more people endorsing stale, old “tough on crime” tactics. It is time to shift this thinking and promote alternatives to law enforcement that are proven to be effective, ” said Michael Huggins, Deputy Senior Director of Policy and Government Affairs at Color Of Change. “As a teacher I wanted what every person wants — to keep their kids safe, their family safe, and their community safe,” said Thea Sebastian, Executive Director of The Futures Institute. “I couldn’t achieve this goal within my classroom. But through this agenda, and alongside the incredible lawmakers and advocates represented here now, I finally have a chance to do so. Over this next year, I look forward to working with all of you — and the more than 90 organizations that have endorsed this agenda and support our Community Safety Working Group — toward making these policy changes a reality, and toward building the new, evidence-based paradigm that will actually keep our kids and communities safe.” Watch the full recording of the press conference HERE. The people who spoke at the press conference, include: Congresswoman Cori Bush (MO-01) Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) Congresswoman Katie Porter (CA-47) Michael Huggins, Color of Change Thea Sebastian, The Futures Institute Rukia Lumumba, Movement For Black Lives\\xa0 Will Simpson, Equal Justice USA Remarks\\xa0 Jason Kimelman-Block, Bend the Arc Alex Dilon, March For Our Lives Kelsey Reyes And Ruth Martin, MomsRising\\xa0 The bills endorsed by the Community Safety Agenda, include, among other things: People\\'s Response Act introduced by Representatives Cori Bush (MO-01), Ayanna Pressley (MA-07), Pramila Jayapal (WA-07), Jan Schakowsky (IL-09), Summer Lee (PA-12), and Morgan McGarvey (KY-03) would create a division on Community Safety within the Department of Health and Human Services that would research and fund life-saving alternatives to incarceration and policing, as well as provide funding opportunities for community-based, non-carceral responses to community safety. Mental Health Justice Act introduced by Representatives Katie Porter (CA-47), Antonio Cárdenas (CA-29), Ayanna Pressley (MA-07), Mary Scanlon (PA-05) and Senator Warren (D-MA) creates a grant program that allows states, tribes, and localities to hire, train, and dispatch mental health professionals to respond to mental health emergencies when 911, 988, or another emergency hotline is called. Opening Doors to Youth Act introduced by Representatives Jesús Garcia (IL-14), Bobby Scott (VA-03), Frederica Wilson (FL-24), and Jahana Hayes (CT-5) establishes and expands youth employment programs through community-based organizations that provide at-risk and opportunity youth with comprehensive pathways to remain connected or reconnect to education and training systems in addition to the supportive services needed to overcome individual barriers to reconnection. Counseling Not Criminalization in Schools Act introduced by Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) and Senator Chris Murphy(D-CT) prohibits federal funds from being used to keep police in schools. Instead, it directs billions towards hiring counselors and support staff, making schools safer and more supportive for all students. As Congress’s first activist from the movement to save Black lives,\\xa0 Congresswoman Bush has been a fierce advocate for an affirmative, evidence-based approach to public safety. Her flagship bill, the People’s Response Act, is among the legislation that is prioritized in the Community Safety Agenda. Specifically, the People’s Response Act legislation would: Create a Division on Community Safety within HHS to fund, conduct, and coordinate research, technical assistance, and grant programs related to non-carceral, health-centered investments in public safety; Launch a federal first responders unit to support states and local governments with emergency health crises; Promote alternative approaches to public safety, including coordination of research and policies that are being implemented across HHS and other agencies to center health-based and non-carceral responses throughout the federal government; Provide $11 billion in grant funding to state and local governments, as well as community-based organizations, to fully fund public safety and improve crisis response; and Establish a $2.5 billion First Responder Hiring Grant to create thousands of jobs and provide funding to state, local, and tribal governments, as well as community organizations, to hire emergency first responders such as licensed social workers, mental health counselors, substance use counselors, and peer support specialists, in an effort to improve crisis response and increase non-carceral, health-based approaches to public safety. \\xa0',\n",

(April 16, 2024) - Today, as House Republicans brought forth yet another messaging bill that fails to address the urgent crisis in the Middle East, Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman (NJ-12) made the following statement on House Resolution 883:\\xa0 \"Antisemitism is a threat to our communities here and abroad and should be addressed in concrete ways in order to protect our Jewish neighbors. But, continuing to vote on non-binding messaging resolutions to score partisan political points is not a concrete solution and is disrespectful to the seriousness of the situation. \"This resolution inflames tensions when de-escalation must be the goal. As the conflict in the Middle East worsens and the humanitarian need grows every day, Congress must be focused on passing supplemental aid that addresses dire needs, eliminating Hamas, securing safe release of the hostages, and working towards a two-state solution. Aid to Ukraine, Taiwan, suffering Palestinian civilians, and the defense of our ally Israel is paramount. \"Today’s frivolous resolution condemning the phrase \\'from the river to the sea\\' - a phrase already condemned by the House of Representatives - is yet another distraction.\\xa0 \"The American people don\\'t want to be pulled into a broader regional war; they want us to expand the Child Tax Credit, address gun violence, mental health, climate change, and affordable health care and child care and they deserve a Congress that will deliver on these issues. \"This legislation distracts from the serious business we should be doing and so I voted \\'no.\\'\"',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON, D.C.– Today, U.S. Representatives Tony Cárdenas, David Trone (D-MD-6), Bruce Westerman (R-AR-4) and Don Bacon (R-NE-2) alongside U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Kevin Cramer (R-ND)reintroduced the bicameral Second Chance Month Resolution. The bicameral, bipartisan effort to designate April 2024 as Second Chance Month serves as reminder of the significant legal and societal barriers for the thousands returning from incarceration each year. In a nation that was founded on new possibilities, this resolution affirms that those who are returning home from jail or prison should have access to rehabilitation, redemption, and the chance to contribute positively to their communities. “Having witnessed firsthand the injustices that countless individuals in my community have faced upon reentry, I’ve made it a priority throughout my years as an elected official to advocate for the resources to make second chances possible,” said Congressman Tony Cárdenas. “In America every person deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, and we must continue to do everything in our power to ensure that people who were formerly incarcerated have access to reentry services and opportunities for a better tomorrow.” \"Second Chance Month is an opportunity to recognize the importance of providing justice-impacted individuals with a real second chance at rebuilding their lives,\" said Congressman David Trone, cofounder, and co-chair of the Second Chance Task Force. \"After decades of overcriminalization, our country must make progress toward putting compassion over confinement. This month — and every month — we recommit ourselves to delivering on this promise.” “Second Chance Month is an important platform to raise awareness of the challenges that formerly incarcerated individuals, who have paid their debt to society, experience in re-entering their communities,” said Congressman Bruce Westerman. “Opportunity after incarceration is critical to breaking the cycle of crime and reducing recidivism. I’m proud to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in this effort to acknowledge that second chances are paramount in fostering safer communities.” “Sadly, many formerly incarcerated individuals return to the prison system because they haven’t been given the opportunity to benefit from rehabilitation, given a chance at a job or training, and have faced scorn from their fellow man,” said Congressman Don Bacon. “The Second Chance Month Resolution highlights the need to focus on opening doors for those who are reentering society, instead of slamming them shut.” “We praise the Senate and House sponsors of the Second Chance Month resolution, which echoes the values shared by Prison Fellowship and the more than 800 churches and partners who believe that Americans with a criminal record can rise from their past, make amends, and reach their God-given potential,” said Heather Rice-Minus, CEO and President of Prison Fellowship. “We support the passing of this resolution and the lawmakers who strive to remove unfair and unnecessary barriers to work, housing, education, and other fundamentals for citizens who have paid their debt to society so they can live lives of productivity and purpose.” Congressman Cárdenas is the founder and chairman of the Youth Justice Caucus, working to support at-risk youth and fix the major problems in the United States juvenile justice system. ###',\n",

For those in my home state of Texas, for example, the choice to honor Juan Gabriel’s ‘Amor Eterno,’ which played at funerals and memorials after the 2019 El Paso shooting, has special meaning. The induction of one’s work into the National Recording Registry represents among the most prestigious honors a musical artist can receive, and today’s inductions are the first songs on the Registry for both Juan Gabriel and Héctor Lavoe. Both musicians were giants of their genres, and I am glad to see their songs preserved for generations to come.” Since it was established by Congress in 2000, the National Recording Registry has worked to preserve recordings with cultural, historic, or aesthetic significance to life in the United States. For the last eighteen years, the Library of Congress has selected 25 recordings for inclusion each year, with works by Latino musicians currently representing less than five percent of inducted titles. Over the last two years, as part of his long-running efforts to improve the recognition of Latino contributions to American history and culture, Congressman Castro has solicited public suggestions for congressional nominations to the National Recording Registry. In his first year of nominations, Congressman Castro received hundreds of public suggestions and submitted 33 titles to the Library of Congress for consideration. The following year, the National Recording Registry inducted two of his nominations – Irene Cara’s “Flashdance…What a Feeling” (1983) and Daddy Yankee’s “Gasolina” (2004), the latter of which made history as the first reggaeton song to be preserved in the registry. In 2023, Congressman Castro received more than 700 suggestions from members of the public and nominated titles by 35 performers – including Juan Gabriel and Héctor Lavoe – for inclusion in this year’s list of inductees. Later this year, Congressman Castro will launch a new call for suggestions to shape his nominations for additions to the National Recording Registry that are expected in 2025.',\n",

       " \"WASHINGTON – Congressman Joaquin Castro (TX-20), a senior member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Congresswoman Veronica Escobar (TX-16) led 24 of their colleagues last night in a letter to U.S Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, and Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines expressing concerns over the methodology used in National Security Memorandum 20 (NSM 20) to ensure that Israel is using U.S. security assistance in compliance with U.S. and international law. NSM 20 is the White House policy that requires recipients of U.S. assistance to provide written assurances that they will use assistance in compliance with U.S. and international law and facilitate — and not restrict — the delivery of humanitarian aid. NSM 20 additionally establishes new reporting requirements to Congress on these provisions. \\xa0“We write to express our deep concern regarding the U.S. Department of State’s recent comments regarding assurances from the Israeli government, under National Security Memorandum (NSM) 20, that the Israeli government is using U.S-origin weapons in full compliance with relevant U.S. and international law and is not restricting the delivery of humanitarian assistance. In the face of mounting credible and deeply troubling reports and allegations that Israel has used U.S arms in ways that violate U.S. and international law, including international humanitarian law as it relates to civilian protections and aid flow, we believe a failure to question, at minimum, the Netanyahu government’s assurances, violates the very spirit of the NSM-20 process,” wrote the lawmakers. “For months, elected representatives, intergovernmental bodies, international courts, Israeli and global human rights observers – along with government officials themselves – have persistently expressed grave concerns regarding the actions of the Netanyahu government,”\\xa0the lawmakers continued. “These include its conduct throughout the war in Gaza, its policies regarding civilian harm and military targeting, unauthorized expansion of settlements and settler violence in the West Bank and potential use of U.S. arms by settlers in additional to limitations on humanitarian aid supported by the US. We are concerned that some of Israel's actions may not be consistent with international humanitarian law, which the United States has an interest in consistently upholding.\\xa0 “We remain concerned by the stark differences and gaps in the statements being made by the State Department and White House on how Israel has not been found to be in violation of international humanitarian law, either when it comes to the conduct of the war or when it comes to the provision of humanitarian assistance, which are contradictory to those made by prominent experts and global institutions. Given the dire and catastrophic nature of this war, it is critical to ensure that the U.S. government is fully utilizing the expertise of State Department and DoD officials and legal experts, accounting important intelligence community assessments and data, in thoroughly assessing Israel’s actions in Gaza. Non-political experts’ substantive analysis is vital to ensuring the accuracy and credibility of any and all of the assessments under NSM-20, as well as in the arms transfer review process and security assistance obligation process.”\\xa0 Today’s letter was sent ahead of the NSM-20 report that is due to Congress on May 8, 2024.

       " 'WASHINGTON – After reports surfaced of lead-tainted applesauce and Lunchables being served to children in Texas and across the country, Congressman Joaquin Castro (TX-20) and 30 members of the Dads Caucus wrote to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) demanding an explanation on how lead-tainted children’s food was allowed to be sold to parents and fed to kids, and to chart a clear path forward to ensure this never happens again. “Alarmingly, this issue was not discovered by the FDA or any other federal oversight agency. The lapse was instead caught after kids started exhibiting symptoms of lead poisoning, and concerned parents and local health officials began looking into possible sources of their illnesses—only to find the culprit in their own pantries,” wrote the members. “Beyond falling short of carrying out the minimum quantity of inspections, the agency has also faltered in its ability to guarantee the quality of these inspections.” The members’ inquiry follows a New York Times investigation on the contamination of certain applesauce products that passed undetected through the import inspection system and resulted in high blood-lead reports in over 500 children in 44 states, as well as recent reports of unacceptable levels of the heavy metal in school-served Lunchables. The Congressional Dads Caucus, founded in January 2023, is a forum for Members of Congress to advocate for legislation that supports working families. Caucus members believe in policy solutions that help working families thrive, including paid family and medical leave policies for all, expanding the Child Tax Credit, increasing access to childcare, and supporting other policies that reduce poverty and ease the burden on working parents. Founding members include Representatives Jimmy Gomez, Rashida Tlaib, Joaquin Castro, Andy Kim, Jamaal Bowman, Rob Menendez, Dan Goldman, Eric Swalwell, Ruben Gallego, Colin Allred, Mike Levin, Josh Harder, and Raul Ruiz. A PDF of the letter can be found HERE and the text is below: Dear Commissioner Califf, We write to you as members of the Congressional Dads Caucus, a diverse group of fathers and mothers who represent districts from across the country and have pledged to advocate for the best interests of all parents and young children. We prioritize policies that uplift and protect all families, from paid leave to affordable and accessible child care for all. Our mission compels us to write to you and express our deep concern regarding the state of children’s food safety in our country, especially considering lead contamination in FDA-approved applesauce last year. We request that the FDA provide us with further information about what the agency is doing to ensure this never happens again and to guarantee food safety for young children. In February, the New York Times reported on the contamination of certain applesauce products that had passed, undetected by inspections or checkpoints, into public consumption. Alarmingly, this issue was not discovered by the FDA or any other federal oversight agency. The lapse was instead caught after kids started exhibiting symptoms of lead poisoning, and concerned parents and local health officials began looking into possible sources of their illnesses—only to find the culprit in their own pantries. Long-term effects of lead toxicity include impairments to the brain and nervous system, and young children undergoing critical mental and physical development are particularly susceptible to lead absorption. Further investigation revealed that lead from lead chromate has been added to ground cinnamon at a plant in Ecuador, likely due to economically motivated adulteration. The contaminated cinnamon then found its way into WanaBana applesauce products and resulted in detrimentally high blood lead levels in hundreds of children across 44 states. The FDA subsequently issued a recall to take these products off the shelves—however, for affected children and families, that change came much too late. In its latest update, the CDC reports over 500 cases across 44 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. More recent news has also highlighted unacceptable levels of the heavy metal in school-served Lunchables, emphasizing the ongoing struggle parents face in keeping their children safe. The current FDA approach to securing food safety operates under the 2011 Food Service Modernization Act (FSMA). Among other mandates, the FSMA requires 19,000 inspections of foreign food manufacturing and processing facilities every year. Only 1,200 such reviews were reported last year. Furthermore, while the FSMA determined that at least 5,000 import investigators should be employed to carry out the required number of inspections, chronic underfunding and staff attrition has resulted in the FDA staffing only 413 investigators. This shortage comes as import volumes increase year by year; last year the agency recorded 15 million lines of food imports. Beyond falling short of carrying out the minimum quantity of inspections, the agency has also faltered in its ability to guarantee the quality of these inspections. Currently the FDA relies on the Foreign Supplier Verification Program (FSVP) to ensure all food imports align with U.S. food standards.\\xa0 FSVP operates by putting the onus for vetting food on the industry. Manufacturers provide their own framework for assessing their products through a food safety plan and hazard assessment. While the FDA provides draft guidance (i.e., lists lead as a hazardous heavy metal), it does not provide or enforce the assessments themselves. The Congressional Dads Caucus acknowledges the need for more agency resources, but we strongly believe the FDA also needs to be doing more with its existing funding to prevent these devastating lapses in food safety. Thus, we ask that you respond to the following questions and provide us with a better understanding of how your efforts will prevent such dangerous food contamination incidents from occurring again: No family should have to question whether the food eaten by their kids every day will cause them harm—especially when these products have already been stamped with FDA approval. We appreciate your attention to these matters and heightened attention to gaps in our food safety, and we look forward to receiving your response. ###',\n",

Grijalva (AZ-07), and Susie Lee (NV-03) introduced H.R. 7990, the Large-Scale Water Recycling Reauthorization and Investment Act of 2024, to reauthorize a water recycling grant program for large-scale projects in California and the other sixteen western states. “This program for large-scale water recycling and reuse that we secured in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law has been a great success, and we shouldn’t let that progress peter out. Our bill would reauthorize funding for this grant program, help bolster the great projects already underway, and ensure it can continue expanding,” said Rep. Huffman. “I\\'m glad to join Rep. Napolitano in this effort and am grateful for her leadership in meeting the needs of everyone with a stake in America\\'s water future.” \"Thanks to President Joe Biden, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Camille Calimlim Touton, and our fellow Democrats in Congress, the game-changing Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $450 Million for vital large-scale water recycling projects, including Pure Water and the Hyperion project in Southern California,\" Napolitano said. \"As we combat extreme drought and prepare for future water shortages in the arid West, Congress must provide additional funding opportunities now to help boost these existing large-scale recycling projects and get new ones off the ground. I thank Representatives Grijalva, Huffman, and Lee for their partnership in championing cost-effective, large-scale water recycling projects and further securing a sustainable, drought-proof water supply for our communities.\" “The climate crisis is affecting nearly every aspect of our lives, but for those of us who live in the West, the dwindling water supply is often top of mind,” Grijalva said. “This legislation builds on the success of water recycling projects funded by the IIJA and put in place by the Biden administration to provide a sustainable solution that can stretch our water supply for millions of people in the years to come. I want to thank Congresswoman Napolitano for her effective leadership on this legislation and for being a longstanding champion of water supply projects over the years.” “We need to save every drop of water we can to combat one of the worst droughts in the history of the American West,” said Congresswoman Susie Lee. “That’s why I was proud to deliver over $122 million for local water projects last year and why I’m so proud to help lead the reauthorization of the Large-Scale Water Recycling Project Grant Program this year. This critical program was made possible by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that I helped negotiate and pass, and I look forward to seeing it reauthorized for another six years to continue delivering the resources our communities need.” The Large-Scale Water Recycling Reauthorization and Investment Act of 2024, reauthorizes the successful Large-Scale Water Recycling grant program within the Department of the Interior for six years for large-scale water recycling projects that have a total estimated cost of at least $1 Billion. The legislation increases the authorization from $450 Million to $1 Billion for the program; projects must be within one of the Bureau of Reclamation\\'s seventeen western states.

The crisis of plastic pollution threatens the planet’s most important natural resources and disproportionately harms vulnerable populations.\\xa0 About 450,000,000 tons of plastic are produced every year, a number that is projected to triple by 2050.\\xa0 In the United States, less than 3 percent of plastic waste is recycled into a similar quality product and research shows human beings swallow the amount of plastic in the typical credit card every week. The text of the letter is below and a PDF is available here. Dear President Biden, President von der Leyen, Secretary General Guterres, and Executive Secretary Mathur-Filipp: We, the undersigned Members of the United States Congress and Members of the European Parliament, write to urge you to address the ability of plastic producing corporations and other industry stakeholders that are highly dependent on plastic, particularly single-use, packaging, disposable and non-durable plastics to exert undue influence on efforts by the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee on Plastic Pollution (INC) to develop an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution. Ahead of the upcoming fourth INC negotiating session, enacting policies that call for the disclosure of representatives for plastic producing industries, petrochemical companies, and other relevant industrial stakeholders that are participating in INC meetings will help ensure that science takes precedence in the outcomes of the agreement. We urge you to take immediate steps to monitor and disclose the influence of plastic producing industries, petrochemical companies, and other relevant industrial stakeholders. As national delegations, independent scientists, civil society organizations, Indigenous Peoples, women, and youth work to develop an ambitious treaty that addresses the full life cycle of plastic pollution, we are concerned that certain corporate interests have outsized influence on the negotiations and would seek to limit commitments and responsibilities to proportionately contribute and implement reforms essential to holistically solve the world’s challenge with plastic pollution. As an illustration of how deep inequities in power and access play out in these negotiations, the chemical and fossil fuel representatives registered to attend the third INC negotiating session outnumber officials from Pacific Small Island Developing States by more than two to one and those of the Scientists’ Coalition for an Effective Plastics Treaty by more than three to one.[1] The\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 143 known fossil fuel and chemical industry lobbyists registered mark a 36% increase from INC- 2 and are a larger group than the number of delegates from the 70 smallest Member States.[2] This overwhelming discrepancy between the number of attendees representing petrochemical industries, which have a vested financial interest in maintaining the status quo, and national and scientific representatives, makes it glaringly obvious how industrial actors’ influence could obstruct meaningful progress. As you know, there is no room for delay to reach an agreement to end the flow of plastics into our environment and commit to a circular economy. To achieve INC’s goal of developing a treaty that addresses the full plastic life cycle, we must acknowledge that plastic pollution begins with fossil fuel extraction. 99% of plastics are produced from fossil fuel-based petrochemicals, which will represent nearly half of oil demand growth by 2050. [3],[4] We cannot recycle our way out of this mess; the U.S. recycling rate stands at a dismal 9%, and less than 10% of all plastic waste generated globally has ever been recycled.[5],[6] Even if we improved our current waste management and recycling systems, not all plastics are recyclable, and some products can only be recycled once or twice.[7] If the new agreement doesn’t adequately address plastic production, particularly the production of single-use and non-durable plastics, no amount of cleanup will protect our environment and health from this crisis. Given the great urgency of the plastic crisis, we must unblock the barriers that have kept us from advancing strong global collaboration to combat plastic pollution. The political influence and obstruction of certain plastic producing industries, petrochemical companies, and other relevant industrial stakeholders has been and remains one of the largest barriers to strong action. Fossil fuel companies and their industry allies have spent billions of dollars lobbying the European Parliament, other European institutions and Member States, the U.S. Congress, and U.S. Executive Branch agencies in order to obstruct or weaken plastics and climate policy for years. Companies attending INC-3 spent more than $85 million on lobbying and political contributions during the 2022 U.S. elections alone.[8] While we acknowledge that engaging with industry can play a role, doing so with industry stakeholders that have consistently engaged in bad faith should be undertaken with extreme caution. A former president of the Plastics Industry Association once said, \"If the public thinks that recycling is working, then they are not going to be as concerned about the environment.\"[9] For more than 30 years, the plastics industry has known that recycling is prohibitively expensive and infeasible, yet it spent tens of millions of dollars on ads to deceive the public and place the burden on individual consumers.[10],[11] Today, hundreds of millions of tons of plastic are produced each year and the rate is projected to nearly triple from 2019 levels by 2050.[12] The equivalent of one garbage truck load of plastic is dumped into the oceans every minute, resulting in waste that lingers in our environment, breaking down into ever smaller microplastics. We cannot afford to dump any more.[13] Moreover, plastics account for 3.4% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.[14] As the world shifts away from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy, the world must also move away from plastic. The planet has already warmed over 1.1°C, and every moment of delay makes to the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C that much more difficult.[15] Drastically reducing plastic production and consumption, and eliminating single-use plastics from global commerce, is essential to achieving critical global climate goals. In April, world governments will gather in Ottawa for INC-4, a critical stage to negotiate treaty text and determine its strength. Parties must seize the opportunity to take ambitious and actionable steps to advancing a science and health-outcomes based global framework for addressing plastic pollution and the life-cycle of plastic through the INC decision-making process. We urge you to institute new policies for corporate and industrial sector representatives’ participation at negotiating sessions, including requiring participating industries to submit an audited corporate political influencing statement that discloses plastics and climate-related lobbying, campaign contributions, and funding of trade associations and organizations active on plastics and climate issues. These statements should be reviewed, publicly disclosed, and scrutinized prior to any engagement in INC negotiations. The INC should also consider additional measures to establish a robust accountability framework to protect against undue influence of corporate actors with proven vested interests that contradict the goals of the global plastics treaty. These reforms would bring much-needed transparency to industrial plastics- related political influencing activities around the world, and they would help to ensure that the INC process is a good faith effort by countries to solve the plastic pollution crisis. We note that this is not the first time that many of us have advocated that the United Nations adopt policies that would limit corporate actors with conflicts of interest from obstructing progress. In May and November 2023, many of the undersigned wrote to U.S., EU, UN and United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) leadership calling on them to work together to institute new policies for corporate participation in Conferences of the Parties (COPs) and UNFCCC processes more broadly, including requiring participating companies to submit an audited corporate political influencing statement that discloses climate related lobbying, campaign contributions, and funding of trade associations and organizations active on energy and climate issues.[16],[17] For the past several years, as in INCs, the number of\\xa0 attendees representing polluting corporate actors at COPs has been larger than the delegations of nearly every country in attendance. Thank you for your attention to this important issue and for your ongoing dedication to building global support for eliminating plastic pollution. We welcome further engagement with you on this topic, and the lead co-signers are available to meet with you at a mutually agreeable time prior to the INC-4 negotiations in April.',\n",
       " 'Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Representative Jared Huffman (CA-02) and Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Jeff Merkley (D-OR) re-introduced the Protecting Communities from Plastics Act, legislation that addresses the plastic production crisis that is fueling climate change and worsening environmental injustice. The reintroduction comes just before the 54th annual Earth Day, the official 2024 theme for which is \"Planet vs. Plastics,” as well as the commencement next week of the fourth session of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee to develop an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution in Ottawa. As leaders meet to address the plastic pollution crisis on an international scale, the U.S. must continue to push for stronger legislation at home. “Plastic pollution has become so ubiquitous that it can be found in the deepest parts of our oceans, every corner of the earth, and even in our body tissue. We are at a crisis level, and the problem doesn’t start or end there. Frontline communities are facing the brunt of this massive environmental injustice through the entire plastics lifecycle, from being poisoned by pollution from petrochemical manufacturing process on the front end, to suffering the consequences of toxic waste on the back end,” said Rep. Huffman. “The only way to truly address this crisis is to tackle the problem at its source: reducing how much plastic is produced in the first place and moving our economy away from its overreliance on single-use plastic. The writing is on the wall for Big Oil\\'s waning dirty-energy dominance – and we won’t let them continue their planet-killing pollution with plastics as a safety net.”\\xa0\\xa0 “The plastic pollution crisis is an urgent threat to our public and environmental health. Communities living near plastics facilities often suffer from exposure to harmful pollutants and increased long-term health complications,” said Senator Booker. “As we continue to tackle climate change and transition to a clean energy economy, fossil-based plastic production undermines our efforts to reduce our carbon emissions and address environmental injustice. This legislation will create nationwide targets for single-use plastic source reduction and pause the permitting of new and expanded plastics facilities while the EPA makes much-needed regulatory updates.” “When it comes to reducing waste, we are taught the three Rs: reduce, reuse, and recycle. However, the reality for plastics is really the three Bs: buried, burned, or borne out to sea—which means dangerous chemicals are seeping into our soil, air, and water. This is a public health emergency for Americans everywhere, and disproportionately impacts communities of color and low-wealth communities,” said Senator Merkley, who serves as the Chair of the Environment and Public Works subcommittee overseeing environmental justice and chemical safety. “With plastic particles ending up on the snowcaps of the Arctic and inside our own bloodstreams, it’s clear we need strong legislation like the Protecting Communities from Plastics Act to get the plastics crisis under control. I will continue to work alongside my colleagues to get these solutions signed into law.” With plastic production and consumption on track to double in the next decade, the resulting greenhouse gas emissions threaten to put our climate goals further out of reach, while expanded plastic production will drive more pollution in environmental justice communities around the United States. Petrochemical, plastic production, and waste incineration facilities, which are disproportionately located in or near Black, Brown, and low-income communities, release harmful air and water pollution that cause increased incidences of asthma, cancers, endocrine disruption, development disorders, and heart disease. Transitioning off of fossil fuels only to replace that demand with more fossil-based plastic production is not a sustainable solution, and will continue to perpetuate existing climate and environmental justice impacts. The Protecting Communities from Plastics Act would: Rep. Huffman is a leader in Congress on combatting plastic pollution. This March, Huffman and Senator Jeff Merkley (D-OR) sent a letter to encourage U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken to push for decisive measures in addressing plastic production at the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC)’s current session. The lawmakers emphasized the imminent danger plastic poses to public health, national security, and the planet\\'s future throughout its life-cycle and advocated for a vigorous stance in the negotiations. Ahead of next week’s INC4 conference, Huffman joined Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Member of the European Parliament Mohammed Chahim to U.S. President Joe Biden and United Nations officials to ramp up scrutiny of the petrochemical industry’s lobbying at global environmental conferences. Rep. Huffman has repeatedly led letters to the Biden administration to urge greater protections and rules to hold polluting industries accountable, including a letter with both former Rep. Alan Lowenthal and Sen. Cory Booker to the EPA calling on the agency to fully consider climate and environmental justice impacts of chemical recycling, or “advanced recycling” technologies in their rulemaking on those processes. Huffman, along with Merkley, leads the Break Free from Plastic Pollution Act, the most comprehensive plan ever introduced in Congress to address the plastic pollution crisis that is poisoning our air, water, and land, and disproportionately impacting communities of color and low-income Americans. The bill is cosponsored by U.S. Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), and Peter Welch (D-VT) and U.S. Representative Betty McCollum (MN-04).

       " 'Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Representatives Jared Huffman (CA-02) and Diana DeGette (CO-01) applauded the Biden Administration for finalizing the Conservation and Landscape Health rule. “Protecting public lands is so important to my constituents, to Californians, and to the millions of people who treasure the spectacular wild places our country has to offer. But all of those places are at risk from the escalating climate crisis and biodiversity loss,” said Representative Huffman. “Representative DeGette and I have been pushing for BLM to make addressing those crises at the forefront of their latest rulemaking, and I’m grateful to see the finalized rule meets that mark. With this move, the Biden-Harris administration is showing they will stand up for the will of the people and what’s best for the planet – not greedy polluters – so we can preserve public lands for future generations.” “The United States is home to some of the most beautiful landscapes in the world, and these public lands provide recreational opportunities, increase tourism, and support biodiversity. Beyond these impacts, public lands play an important role in mitigating the impact of climate change and improving the health of our planet,” said DeGette. “Today’s final rule is a significant accomplishment for land conservation and wildlife protection, and I am proud that BLM and the Biden Administration are continuing to lead in defending our natural world. Protecting public lands is good public policy, and I have been working in Congress to pass meaningful legislation that conserves public lands in Colorado and throughout the country. I will continue to ensure that even more public lands will be protected and enjoyed for generations to come.” The Conservation and Landscape Health rule provides tools for the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to improve the resilience of public lands in the face of a changing climate and biodiversity loss, conserve important wildlife habitat and intact landscapes, plan for development, and better recognize unique cultural and natural resources on public lands. The announcement from BLM follows sustained efforts by Reps. DeGette and Huffman to urge the Biden Administration to finalize this rule. BLM’s Public Lands Rule is nearly universally popular; a recent analysis found that 92% of public comments submitted on the proposed rule were supportive. The support for the rule reflects a broader sentiment about conservation and public lands among most Americans. In the West, for example, where the vast majority of BLM lands are located, 82% of voters across the political spectrum support a national goal of conserving America’s public lands and waters over the next decade.',\n",
       " 'Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Representative Jared Huffman (D-San Rafael) and U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-CA) led 19 of their colleagues in an urgent letter to President Joe Biden and Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo calling for them to swiftly declare a federal fishery disaster, joining California Governor Gavin Newsom in his request. This follows the Pacific Fishery Management Council’s stark recommendation to implement a complete closure of California’s commercial and recreational ocean salmon season for the second consecutive year, expected to take effect in May 2024. If granted, the relief would provide necessary assistance for communities grappling with the challenges of the ongoing crisis. “The unprecedented back-to-back closures of the entire California salmon fishery is a devastating crisis. It remains unclear how long the salmon fishery will need to be closed, and we know there is much work ahead of us. The long-term solutions will include improving our drought resiliency, restoring salmon habitat, and of course, addressing the climate crisis. We look forward to continuing our work with your administration on these goals,” the members said in their letter.  “However, Californians who depend on the fishery, and are still trying to recover from last season’s closure, have no time to wait for these long-term objectives to be achieved. A federal fishery disaster declaration will help our commercial and charter fisheries, tribes, and communities survive the difficult times ahead,” the members concluded.  In April 2023, Huffman, Padilla, and Panetta led their colleagues in an urgent letter to President Joe Biden and Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, calling for them to swiftly declare a federal fishery disaster for the 2023 salmon season. Earlier that month, Rep. Huffman held a press conference with Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, Representative Kevin Mullin, and fishing industry stakeholders to call attention to this disaster and highlight the people who will bear the brunt of the impacts of closing the salmon season. In addition to regular engagement with NOAA, Rep. Huffman held a call directly with NOAA Administrator Dr. Rick Spinrad to continue the pressure and encourage him to prompt action. As part of his long-standing efforts to improve disaster relief for fisheries, Congressman Huffman was able to help secure an additional $300 million for fishery disaster declarations Fiscal Year 2023 Omnibus Appropriations bill. Congress also authorized new bipartisan fishery disaster relief language based on Congressman Jared Huffman and Senator Roger Wicker’s Fishery Resource Disasters Improvement Act. This language streamlines the process for declaring a federal fishery disaster and helps to quickly provide relief to affected communities. It also extends eligibility for federal fishery disaster funds not only to commercial fisheries, but also to charter fishing businesses and impacted tribes. In addition to Representative Huffman and Senator Padilla, the letter was signed by Senator Laphonza Butler (D-CA) and Representatives Nanette Barragán (CA-44), Ami Bera (CA-06), Salud Carbajal (CA-24), Jim Costa (CA-21), Mark DeSaulnier (CA-10), Anna Eshoo (CA-16), John Garamendi (CA-08), Josh Harder (CA-09), Sydney Kamlager-Dove (CA-37), Zoe Lofgren (CA-18), Doris Matsui (CA-07), Kevin Mullin (CA-15), Jimmy Panetta (CA-19), Nancy Pelosi (CA-11), Katie Porter (CA-47), Raul Ruiz (CA-25), Eric Swalwell (CA-14), and Mike Thompson (CA-04).

       " \"Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Representative Jared Huffman (CA-02) and Rosemary Ahtuangaruak, Founder of Grandmothers Growing Goodness and Former Mayor of Nuiqsut, host a virtual press conference to respond to the Department of the Interior’s (DOI) decision regarding their protections for designated Special Areas in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. Speakers discussed the action’s potential to protect the Western Arctic’s indigenous communities from new oil and gas drilling and safeguard the food security, cultural traditions, and health of these vulnerable communities.  Click here to view a recording of the press event Following significant engagement with the public, Alaska Native Tribes, and Alaska Native Corporations, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) finalized the Management and Protection of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska (NPR-A) rule that will ensure maximum protection for significant resource values on the more than 13 million acres of Special Areas in the western Arctic, while supporting subsistence uses and needs for Alaska Native communities. The BLM is also announcing that it will publish a Request for Information in the coming weeks to solicit public comment on whether to consider adding resource values to existing Special Areas, expanding Special Areas, or creating new Special Areas within the NPR-A. Management and Protection of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska Rule Under the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act (NPRPA) of 1976, as amended, Congress directed the BLM to balance oil and gas development with the management and protection of significant resource values in locations known as Special Areas and mitigate impacts of oil and gas activities on surface resources across the reserve. The final rule updates the existing regulatory framework, adopted more than 40 years ago, allowing the BLM to more effectively respond to changing conditions in the NPR-A, while striking a balance between oil and gas development and the management and protection of surface values, including wildlife habitat vital to subsistence. Extending from the northwest slope of the Brooks Range to the Arctic Coast, the NPR-A encompasses roughly 23 million acres of public land managed by the BLM. Tribal Nations have occupied lands now within the NPR-A since time immemorial, and more than 40 Indigenous communities continue to rely on the resources from the Reserve for subsistence, harvesting caribou, shore and waterbirds, and many other fish and wildlife species. Many communities subsist primarily on food that, in turn, relies on the Special Areas of the NPR-A. Natural conditions in the Arctic are changing rapidly due to climate change, which is affecting caribou movement and herd health, causing degradation of permafrost, and altering habitats for wildlife, migratory birds, and native plants throughout the NPR-A. The final rule codifies protections for 13.3 million acres encompassed by the existing Special Areas, limiting future oil and gas leasing and industrial development in the Teshekpuk Lake, Utukok Uplands, Colville River, Kasegaluk Lagoon, and Peard Bay Special Areas – places collectively known for their globally significant intact habitat for wildlife, including grizzly and polar bears, caribou and hundreds of thousands of migratory birds. The rule also codifies existing prohibitions on new leasing in 10.6 million acres, more than 40 percent of the NPR-A, consistent with the current NPR-A Integrated Activity Plan (IAP). Congressman Jared Huffman’s Remarks Thank you, Abby. And hello, everyone. I am Congressman Jared Huffman from the beautiful north coast of California. For those who follow my work in the Congress, you know that I spend a lot of my time working to protect Alaska's wilderness or the people and wildlife that call it home. I want to issue a big thank you to LCV, to Arc Initiatives and everybody joining the call today to talk about this really great news with the unbelievable chaos that Team Extreme, the Republican conference in the House is causing with their limited time in the majority. It sure is nice to be able to celebrate something positive, something meaningful like this in an otherwise dysfunctional Congress. I am a climate hawk, and so what that means is I want to take bold climate action at every opportunity. I'm never going to really be fully satisfied until we get the atmosphere stabilized so that future generations can live on this planet. I won't live to see that. But I want to do as much as I can to put us on that path. And I think we need to give a lot of credit to the Biden administration, the Biden-Harris administration, for the historic climate action that they have made, the progress they made over the past three plus years. Democrats have been working to take actions that previously were unthinkable just a few short years ago when Republicans were screaming from the rooftops that climate change wasn't even real, that we should just drill, baby, drill. I want everyone to really appreciate how big this latest rulemaking from the Department of Interior is. 13 million acres of the Western Arctic now protected. That is record breaking. It is a huge step forward in our ongoing climate and conservation efforts. Not only does it codify existing prohibitions on new leasing in more than 40% of the NPR-A, but it provides greater clarity guidelines to ensure that development protects vital resources for subsistence while honoring existing rights. That's going to help BLM effectively fulfill its obligation to tribal nations. It's hard to find adequate words to describe how special and pristine this place is that we're talking about. The Western Arctic is ground zero for climate change. Every inch of land, water, permafrost holds on to carbon. And so, letting the fossil fuel industry desecrate this place for their dirty energy agenda would wreak absolute havoc on wildlife, native communities, and our climate. These Big Oil barons have tried to find, tried to claim every ounce of oil and gas in the Arctic, regardless of the consequences to our planet and those who live on this land or near this land. And this role is an important step for us to say no, finally, to say no to them, no more plundering our public lands, no more destroying indigenous people's way of life by wringing dry the ecosystems they've relied on since time immemorial. There is still a lot more work that we need to do to protect more of the Western Arctic and to create more permanent protections in other pristine places. We need to continue to put People over Polluters when we make these decisions. But we're fighting back at every turn to protect the Arctic, and we're going to keep doing that. We're going to continue to build on this great progress. And we are making great strides here. So, this is a moment to celebrate and appreciate for sure. More to come. Thank you.\",\n",
       " '\\xa0 [WASHINGTON, DC] – U.S. Senators Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and Cory Booker (D-NJ) today re-introduced legislation that would ensure prison disaster response and recovery plans protect the health, safety and civil rights of incarcerated individuals during natural disasters and public health emergencies. The Correctional Facility Disaster Preparedness Act would require the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to provide an annual damage assessment report after a presidential disaster declaration, require the National Institute of Correction (NIC) Advisory Board to conduct a field hearing on how to better incorporate considerations for incarcerated individuals in its emergency preparedness plans and recovery efforts as well as expand NIC Advisory Board membership by permanently authorizing four new members including a formerly incarcerated individual, an emergency coordinator, a public health expert and a BOP labor union representative. “Incarcerated individuals are particularly vulnerable during major disasters since they rely on staff to provide necessities and decide whether to evacuate to a safer location,” said Duckworth. “I’m re-introducing the Correctional Facility Disaster Preparedness Act today to help make sure that federal and state correctional agencies appropriately prioritize the health and safety of incarcerated individuals and staff during major disasters and public health emergencies by better assessing damages sustained from these disasters, taking corrective actions to resolve preparedness gaps and seeking input from professionals with emergency management and health backgrounds, as well as formerly incarcerated individuals.” “We have seen that the response and preparedness plans currently used in our federal prisons are often inadequate, leaving incarcerated people and correctional facility staff particularly vulnerable to major disasters,” said Booker. “I’m pleased to partner with Senator Duckworth to introduce this vital legislation that would strengthen the response and preparedness plans and better protect the health, well-being, and dignity of incarcerated people during emergencies.” The bill is supported by JustLeadershipUSA and the American Federation of Government Employees’ Council of Prison Locals C-33. “We want to thank Sen. Duckworth for once again bringing the Correctional Facility Disaster Preparedness Act before Congress. This legislation is literally about the difference between life and death for people who are incarcerated. While other places of congregate living—such as nursing homes, college dormitories, hospitals, and hotels—are all required by law to have emergency plans in place for occupancy, our prisons and jails sadly are not required or mandated to have these precautions in place, which is why this is vitally important,” said DeAnna Hoskins, President and CEO of JustLeadershipUSA. “As extreme temperatures and violent weather caused by the climate crisis increase across our nation, and COVID-19 continues to harm us, it is urgent that Congress take immediate measures and pass legislation to begin taking the necessary steps to put policies and procedures in place to protect not only the valuable lives of men and women behind bars but also the correctional staff who work in those facilities.” \\xa0\\xa0 -30-  ',\n",
       " '\\xa0 [WASHINGTON, D.C.]\\xa0– Today,\\xa0U.S. Senators Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Chair of Subcommittee on the Multilateral International Development, Multilateral Institutions, and International Economic, Energy and Environmental Policy, Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, along with Senators Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) announced the introduction of a resolution calling on the United States to invest in ending toxic lead exposure. According to UNICEF, lead is responsible for nearly 1.5 percent of annual global deaths. The resolution highlights the wide-range of detrimental effects toxic lead exposure has on human health, the environment, and economic development, drawing attention to the breadth of lead exposure globally and expressing concern for the dangerous levels of lead in the blood of a third of the world’s children. Most importantly, the resolution calls on the United States to invest in lead prevention in global health, education and environmental programs abroad. “The persistence\\xa0of lead is a public health crisis that has plagued communities across our nation for far too long,” said Senator Duckworth. “There is no safe level of lead in our environment—and as we continue our ongoing work to remove lead service lines\\xa0and reduce the risk of lead poisoning for our children, I’m proud to introduce this resolution alongside my colleagues to call on the United States to invest in lead prevention here at home and abroad.” “There is no safe level of lead exposure, and we have a responsibility to protect our children and vulnerable populations who are disproportionately impacted by it,” said Chair Cardin. “Yet, despite proven, cost-effective prevention approaches, there is relatively little global assistance to help prevent lead exposure. More must be done to support the efforts of agencies like the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), who are working to address the disproportionate harm on low- and middle-income countries. I encourage other high-income nations to join this call to invest in opportunities to work with international organizations to assist in amplifying a global lead prevention effort.” “No matter where a child is in the world, they deserve to be in a lead-free environment. In the United States, we’re taking action to replace every lead pipe in households across America, and last Congress we passed major legislation to do just that. However, there is still more work to be done to tackle lead exposure in the U.S. and around the world. This resolution highlights the scope of this global public health threat, and together, we can push for further action,” said Senator Merkley. “One-third of the world’s children have dangerous levels of lead in their blood, which we know is linked to harmful effects on brain and nervous system development,” said Senator Booker. “I’m proud to cosponsor this resolution that will help increase awareness about the impacts of lead poisoning on children and implement strategies for prevention both at home and abroad.” “Lead exposure poses a grave risk to children – whose health and development can be irreversibly compromised by its effects – and to broader communities and economies across the globe. Recognizing the dire consequences of this toxin, our international development programs must prioritize lead exposure prevention – so we can ensure a safer and healthier future for children around the world,” said Senator Van Hollen.

From 2022 to 2023, the number of people ICE placed in solitary confinement increased by 61 percent. Between 2018 and 2023, ICE placed individuals in solitary confinement more than 14,000 times. ICE has also been keeping individuals in solitary for longer periods. In the last five years, roughly half the people in ICE’s solitary units remained there for more than 15 days, and the average length of time in solitary was 27 days.

Durbin also highlighted his Chicago HEAL Initiative, a collaboration among the ten largest hospitals serving Chicago to address the root causes of gun violence through economic, health, and community projects in 18 of Chicago’s neighborhoods with the highest rates of violence, poverty, and health disparities.\\xa0 Durbin thanked the Illinois Health and Hospital Association (IHA) for their efforts in supporting the program. Following his speech, Durbin also fielded questions from Jim Prister, President and CEO of RML Specialty Hospital, about bolstering the health care workforce and improving access to health care for those living in rural areas. After leaving the stage, Durbin met with the President and CEO of IHA, AJ Wihelmi, as well as hospital leaders and representatives from across Illinois.\\xa0 During their meeting, Durbin and IHA members discussed lowering prescription prices, financial pressures facing hospitals, and workforce and staffing issues. Photos of the event can be found here. Durbin’s remarks as prepared for delivery are below: U.S. Senator Dick Durbin Remarks at American Hospital Association Annual Meeting April 16, 2024 As prepared for delivery Thank you, Jim, for the introduction.\\xa0 Good morning, everyone.\\xa0 It is a pleasure to be here. Let’s rewind to four years ago.\\xa0 A novel virus, COVID-19, relegated us to our homes and shut down our country.\\xa0 While a vaccine was being developed, half-a-million Americans died.\\xa0\\xa0 And amidst the fear and panic, the President at the time was spreading falsehoods, encouraging hateful rhetoric, and casting doubt on our medical experts. But it was our health care infrastructure—our doctors, nurses, and front-line workers—who risked their lives to safeguard ours. A silver lining of that devastating pandemic was the appreciation it showed us for our medical professionals and our hospitals.\\xa0 We could not have gotten through the pandemic without them. Because the reality is that our hospitals are not just physical spaces for treatment.\\xa0 You are anchors of our communities.\\xa0 This comes with the responsibility of serving your community reliably and faithfully, but it also provides you with an opportunity to strengthen your neighborhoods and keep people healthy.\\xa0 Right now, our hospitals and health care system face severe challenges that impact their ability to serve Americans. We are at a crossroads, with some questioning how our hospitals fit into the new reality of health care access. In rural communities nationwide, hospitals are struggling.\\xa0 Half operate in the red, and more than 300 are at “immediate risk” of closure. That is why last spring, I introduced the Rural Hospital Closure Relief Act with Senator James Lankford, which would support financially vulnerable rural hospitals by helping them convert to “Critical Access Hospital” status. Right now, if you are 34 miles away from the nearest hospital, you cannot qualify for this financial lifeline.\\xa0 We think this strict federal limit does not account for the true value and characteristics of what a rural hospital means for its community.\\xa0 Why is this important?\\xa0 Let me share a short story.\\xa0\\xa0 In Watseka, Illinois, there is a hospital called Iroquois Memorial.\\xa0 It opened its doors in 1916, and today has 425 employees and serves 75,000 patients.\\xa0 For many in the region, Iroquois Memorial Hospital is the closest medical provider. But the hospital was struggling financially, threatening its ability to serve its community. So, last August, I helped Iroquois Memorial Hospital become approved for Critical Access status. The leadership and community told me that this designation helped save the hospital, allowing it to stabilize financially and remain a critical health resource. I know the AHA supports expanding this eligibility for rural hospitals facing closure risk.\\xa0 Our bipartisan bill is the most viable way to do so.\\xa0 We’d love your support. But that’s not the only challenge facing our hospitals.\\xa0 The number one issue I hear?\\xa0 Workforce shortages. Over the next decade, we face a shortfall of 120,000 doctors.\\xa0 And a survey found that 100,000 nurses left the field during the pandemic, and another 800,000 plan to retire soon. With not enough health care providers available, patients suffer.\\xa0 And medical professionals face increased stress and pressure. In Congress, there are several things we can do to help. First, I am working with Senator Lisa Murkowski to address our nation’s nursing shortage with legislation that would address the pay gap between clinical and faculty nursing jobs … and incentivize more nurses to pursue teaching roles.\\xa0 Second, there is a program called the National Health Service Corps.\\xa0 It provides scholarship and loan repayment to medical providers who work in rural and urban areas of need. Nationwide, there are 20,000 professionals serving under this program, treating 21 million patients. Senator Marco Rubio and I have a bipartisan measure to extend the National Health Service Corps and nearly triple its funding level.\\xa0 It would address the shortage of doctors, nurses, and dentists—of which our nation faces a particular shortage. Third is simple: more medical residency slots.\\xa0 Congress invested in 1,250 additional Medicare-funded training slots in recent years, but we need to do much, much more. While our hospitals are world-class centers of healing and treatment, it is becoming increasingly apparent that they also are anchors for the community. Hospitals are some of the largest employers in town, and have the trust and reputation to propel change.\\xa0 We have a national example of this underway in Chicago. In 2018, I brought together the CEOs of the 10 largest hospitals serving Chicago to hear what they were doing outside of their walls to address the root causes of gun violence. They were all saying similar things, and so we came up with a plan: 16 commitments of how to better engage the community. One of the CEOs told me, “Senator, this is the first time we’ve all sat down at a table together … we’re normally competitors.” There are two people here today that I want to acknowledge who have played an essential role on this project: AJ Wilhelmi, head of the Illinois Health & Hospital Association, and Gene Woods, head of Advocate Health. We are now in our fifth year of the effort, with amazing results.\\xa0 Last year, these 10 hospitals operated 24 school- and mobile-health clinics, serving more than 11,000 Chicago Public School students. And they hired more than 5,300 staff from the South and West Side zip codes facing the highest rates of poverty and violence. And last year alone, the hospitals provided 3,600 local students with shadowing programs to build the pipeline of health workers. I have supported them with millions of dollars in earmark funding, as well as identifying new federal opportunities, but this has been a real hospital-led project.\\xa0 And we are now in the process of creating the first gun violence registry in the country, to share hospital data so we can better identify trends, risks, and intervene with professional help. This is not just a model for gun violence.\\xa0 HEAL also provided a framework for collaboration on COVID and measles response. Hospitals are making positive impacts on their communities outside of their role of providing traditional medical care.\\xa0 So, for those skeptical about hospitals fulfilling their mission to the community, I would point to initiatives like HEAL. But, that also is not a blank check to operate your hospital like an investment fund.\\xa0 There are benefits that hospitals enjoy, so long as they fulfill their responsibility to their patients and staff.\\xa0 To close, I would like to bring you back to 2018.\\xa0 Chicago was seeing a spike in gun violence.\\xa0 In response, the community demanded a new Level 1 trauma center on the South Side, and UChicago listened. Over the past five years, that UChicago Medicine Trauma Center has treated 8,000 gunshot victims.

       " 'WASHINGTON – U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today delivered an opening statement during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing entitled “Legacy of Harm: Eliminating the Abuse of Solitary Confinement.” The hearing will examine the frequent abuse of solitary confinement in federal custody, including members of vulnerable populations and those suffering from mental illness. The hearing follows the introduction of two bills—the Solitary Confinement Reform Act and the Restricting Solitary Confinement in Immigration Detention Act—by Durbin on Monday, which would limit the use of solitary confinement by the Bureau of Prisons (BOP), U.S. Marshals Service, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\\xa0 Key Quotes: “In 2012, I convened the first-ever congressional hearing on solitary confinement.\\xa0 I am extremely disappointed that more than a decade later, the overuse of solitary confinement remains a stain on our nation.” “Prolonged exposure to solitary confinement can be as profound and permanent as a traumatic brain injury and can result in psychological and physical disabilities.\\xa0 Research by experts and testimony from countless people who have spent time in solitary documents how it worsens preexisting medical and mental health conditions and creates conditions that didn’t previously exist.” “I held a follow-up hearing two years after my 2012 hearing. We heard from Damon Thibodeaux [who] tragically died in 2021 from COVID-19.\\xa0 He spent 15 years in solitary before he was exonerated in 2012.\\xa0 He told us, ‘I do not condone what those who have killed and committed other serious offenses have done.\\xa0 But I also don’t condone what we do to them when we put them in solitary for years on end and treat them as sub-human.\\xa0 We are better than that.\\xa0 As a civilized society, we should be better than that.’” “After my hearings, the Obama Administration took some important steps to reduce the use of restricted housing in the federal prison system.\\xa0 Unfortunately, under the Trump Administration, that progress stalled, and the rate of individuals in solitary confinement steadily increased.\\xa0 BOP Director Peters told this Committee that this is one of her priorities. But unfortunately, as I have pointed out numerous times, numbers in solitary are higher today than they were two years ago.\\xa0 This is deeply disappointing.” “Individuals who violate our criminal and immigration laws must be held accountable, but they can be detained in a humane manner that does not violate their fundamental human rights.\\xa0 We in Congress can’t just blame it on the Executive Branch. We must look in the mirror and acknowledge our obligation to eliminate the abuse of solitary confinement.” “That is why I reintroduced the Solitary Confinement Reform Act with Senator Coons and the Restricting Solitary Confinement in Immigration Detention Act with Senator Schatz.\\xa0 I hope my colleagues will join me in making these bills the law of the land.” Video of Durbin’s opening statement is available here. Audio of Durbin’s opening statement is available here. Footage of Durbin’s opening statement is available here for TV Stations. In the last five years alone, ICE has placed people in solitary confinement over 14,000 times, with an average duration of 27 days. In 2023, of those detained in solitary in an ICE facility, an estimated 56 percent had mental health conditions—up from 35 percent in 2019.\\xa0 The hearing continues Chair Durbin and the Senate Judiciary Committee’s work to limit solitary confinement. In 2012, Durbin held the first-ever congressional hearing on solitary confinement as Chair of the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Human Rights. Following that hearing, BOP took steps to reduce its use of solitary confinement. By Durbin’s second hearing on the topic in 2014, the percentage of individuals held in solitary confinement had declined from 7.7 percent to 6.4 percent of the total BOP population. In 2016, President Obama announced he would ban the use of solitary confinement for juveniles in the federal system and accept recommendations from a comprehensive Justice Department (DOJ) report to ensure that the practice would “be used rarely, applied fairly, and subjected to reasonable constraints.” Unfortunately, the Obama-era declines in solitary confinement were reversed under the Trump Administration. Despite President Biden’s 2022 executive order that ordered the Attorney General to implement DOJ’s 2016 report and recommendations, there has been no significant decrease in BOP’s restricting housing population. The percentage of individuals held in solitary confinement is approximately eight percent of the total BOP population as of April 2024. Earlier this month, Durbin and a group of Senate Democrats urged Department of Homeland Security Secretary (DHS) Alejandro Mayorkas and ICE Acting Director Patrick Lechleitner to phase out the use of solitary confinement in immigration detention. The letter noted that the number of individuals in solitary confinement in ICE detention has increased in recent years, and today, an estimated 56 percent of individuals in ICE’s solitary confinement have mental health conditions—up from 35 percent in 2019. \\xa0Earlier this year, Durbin issued a sharp rebuke of BOP’s failure to eliminate the overuse of solitary confinement. -30-',\n",

Durbin first questioned Gretta Goodwin, the Director of Homeland Security and Justice at the Government Accountability Office (GAO), about GAO’s February report on solitary confinement in BOP which found that BOP has not fully implemented 54 of the 87 recommendations from two prior studies on improving restrictive housing practices. “To think individuals are\\xa0incarcerated and isolated for\\xa0months, if not years, at a time is\\xa0unthinkable.\\xa0 Why is it [that] we have strong\\xa0reactions against physical\\xa0cruelty, [but] we don't have strong\\xa0reaction against mental cruelty?\\xa0 [Director] Goodwin, is there any\\xa0recommendation you would like to\\xa0point out of the 87 made to the\\xa0Bureau of Prisons you think\\xa0would make a difference?” Durbin asked. \\xa0 Director Goodwin responded that GAO is working closely with BOP to see how they plan to meet the recommendations.\\xa0 She continued to say, “there are some [recommendations] that speak to alternatives to solitary confinement.” Durbin then asked Ms. Nicole Davis, the Executive Director of Talk2Me Foundation, who was incarcerated for 13.5 years in federal prison at FCI Danbury in Connecticut, if she had any visitation, including counselors during her time in solitary confinement.\\xa0 Ms. Davis responded that she did not have any visitation and continued to say, “no one came back there to check on me.” “Did you ask for any counseling—medical counseling?” Durbin asked. Ms. Davis responded that no one answered her requests forcounseling while incarcerated, though she did seek counseling once she was released.\\xa0 Durbin then asked Dr. Katherine Peeler, a Harvard Medical School professor, and a medical expert with Physicians for Human Rights (PHR), about reforms in North Dakota to address solitary confinement, where the use of solitary confinement has been drastically reduced. Durbin concluded, “I cannot understand how states are showing such leadership in this area and we are failing so badly.\\xa0 I’m going to call on [BOP] Director Peters to explain why she has not implemented the GAO recommendations and hold her accountable for that.” Video of Durbin’s questions in Committee is available here.

Ms. Abrenica is currently pursuing a career in psychiatry as a resident at the University of Wisconsin, and she is a passionate advocate for DACA. The pair discussed Durbin’s Dream Act, bipartisan legislation that would allow noncitizens without lawful status who were brought to the United States as children and meet certain education or work requirements to earn lawful permanent residence. These young people, known as Dreamers, have lived in America since they were children, built their lives here, and are American in every way except for their immigration status.\\xa0 However, under current law, there is often no chance for them to ever become citizens and fulfill their potential.\\xa0 “Alyssandra is on a trailblazing path to serving her community as a psychiatrist, and I was honored to talk with her today. Every Dreamer whom I’ve met has a unique and inspiring story like Alyssandra’s, but one theme repeatedly emerges: fear of deportation. I’ve shared almost 150 stories from Dreamers across our country on the Senate floor, because their stories are the embodiment of the American dream. These young people are business owners, teachers, parents, athletes, scientists, nurses, health care workers, musicians… and it’s time for Congress to get to work and pass the Dream Act once and for all,” said Durbin.

Pennell, to be United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Washington; and Jeannette A. Vargas, to be United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York. Key Quotes: “I am pleased to introduce Kevin Ritz, nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.\\xa0 Mr. Ritz grew up in Memphis, and he received his B.A. from the University of Virginia.\\xa0 He went on to earn his M.S. from the highly respected Georgetown University School of Foreign Service and his J.D from the University of Virginia School of Law.” “After law school, Mr. Ritz served as a law clerk to Judge Julia Smith Gibbons on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Memphis.\\xa0 He then began working as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Tennessee.\\xa0 He went on to serve in a variety of roles within the office, and as Appellate Chief he personally wrote more than 200 briefs and argued 37 federal appeals.” “After receiving blue slips from both Tennessee Senators, Mr. Ritz was confirmed by the Senate to be U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Tennessee by voice vote in September of 2022.\\xa0 In that role, he serves as the chief federal law enforcement officer for the 22 counties of the district and supervises the other attorneys in the office.\\xa0 As U.S. Attorney, Mr. Ritz created the National Security and Civil Rights Unit within the Criminal Division of his office.\\xa0 He also regularly meets with and convenes law enforcement and community partners to discuss violent crime reduction efforts and other priorities.” “I congratulate Mr. Ritz and his family on his nomination, and I look forward to hearing his testimony today.” Video of Durbin’s opening statement is available here.

Key Quotes: “Let me say at the outset, Mr. Ritz has been judged by the American Bar Association… they contacted attorneys in the area as well as judges. Their conclusion, ‘Unanimously Well Qualified.’” “I have said it many times—there cannot be one set of rules forRepublican nominees and another for Democratic nominees.\\xa0 So today and throughout this session, I am following the same standard that Senate Republicans set.\\xa0 Senate Republicans confirmed a nominee to the Third Circuit after the Trump White House refused to let Democratic home state Senators even meet with him.\\xa0 Another Third Circuit nominee was informed that he would be nominated weeks before the Trump White House had a single conversation about the vacancy with Senator Casey of Pennsylvania. And the Trump White House Counsel informed Senator Baldwin of Wisconsin during their very first conversation about a Seventh Circuit vacancy that the White House had already selected a nominee without her knowledge.\\xa0 That doesn’t seem like much consultation to me.\\xa0 But Senate Republicans said it was plenty.” “Given that history, the White House consulted with the Tennessee Senators on this very vacancy significantly more than precent requires.\\xa0 The White House has been discussing this… with the Tennessee Senators since August of 2023.\\xa0 They exchanged names of potential candidates in October of 2023.\\xa0 Mr. Ritz interviewed with members of the Tennessee Senators’ staffs in both October and November 2023.\\xa0 The White House Counsel’s Office interviewed the Tennessee Senators’ suggested candidates in November of 2023.\\xa0 The White House then gave the Tennessee Senators the opportunity to choose from three candidates, including Mr. Ritz.\\xa0 The Tennessee Senators refused to do so.\\xa0 The White House also repeatedly offered the Tennessee Senators the opportunity to interview Mr. Ritz.\\xa0 Senator Blackburn did not take them up on the offer until March of this year and Senator Hagerty did not conduct an interview with Mr. Ritz until yesterday.\\xa0 My Democratic colleagues would have been grateful to receive such a courtesy from the Trump White House.\\xa0 But what did Senator Blackburn offer instead?\\xa0 Calling this a ‘back-room deal.’” “Senators Blackburn and Hagerty may have preferred another individual for the vacancy, but consistent with precedent set by former Republican Chairs of the Committee, we will proceed with the hearing for Mr. Ritz.” Video of Durbin’s response to Sen.

Pennell, nominated to be United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Washington; and Jeannette A. Vargas, nominated to be United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York. Durbin began by noting Mr. Ritz’s record of public service and the fact that the American Bar Association rated him unanimously “Well Qualified” to be a United States Circuit Judge for the Sixth Circuit. “At the outset, let me say, as I did before, that you have been found unanimously ‘Well Qualified’ by the American Bar Association after they have asked members of the Bar… about your performance throughout the course of your life and particularly as a U.S. Attorney,” said Durbin.\\xa0 “I am going to enter into the record a letter which we received from the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association in which they say of your nomination, ‘at every turn throughout his nearly 20 years serving the Western District of Tennessee, community leaders and law enforcement leaders who know Mr. Ritz have come away deeply impressed at how thorough and principled Mr. Ritz has shown himself to be time and again.’” Durbin then asked Mr. Ritz about his role in representing the government in United States v. Castleman. “Mr. Ritz, I see that from 2011 to 2014, you represented the government in United States v. Castleman.\\xa0 That case involved the question of whether someone convicted of a crime of domestic violence could possess a firearm under federal law.\\xa0 Eventually, the case made it all the way to the Supreme Court, and a unanimous Court sided with you and the government.\\xa0 Could you tell us more about your role in that litigation?” Mr. Ritz responded that it was, “a really important case about the federal law that prohibits people from possessing firearms if they have a prior domestic violence conviction.\\xa0 It is of course a very important tool, and has been an important tool, for federal prosecutors in our district and elsewhere, to keep firearms out of the hands of domestic abusers.” Video of Durbin’s questions for Mr. Ritz in Committee is available here.

Durbin then asked Judge Pennell about her role within the re-entry drug court teams while she was an attorney at the Federal Defenders of Eastern Washington and Idaho. “Judge Pennell, there is a part of your life where you were dealing with drug re-entry court. I’ve seen those courts used successfully in Illinois, in Chicago, and in Cook County dealing with veterans and people with special disability situations,” Durbin said.\\xa0 “What was your experience?” Judge Pennell responded that, “Drug courts are exceedingly important for public safety. My experience with drug court was in the federal context where we had a re-entry court for individuals leaving federal prison… My understanding is that recidivism was reduced and amazingly, so many people ended up with full-time jobs at the end of the experience, and really being able to contribute to the community.\\xa0 It was an important public safety result and an important result for our community in terms of getting people back into work.” Durbin then asked Ms. Vargas about her experience as a prosecutor and Mr. Murphy about his work on criminal defense. “As I look at your backgrounds, it’s interesting the contrast… Mr. Murphy seems to have dedicated a large part of his professional life to defense work.\\xa0 Ms. Vargas, prosecuting,” Durbin said.\\xa0 “The concern obviously from Members of the Committee, which has been expressed over and over again, is can you see the other side of the story?\\xa0 Can you treat the prosecutor, in your case Mr. Murphy, with the same level of respect and professional courtesy that you would want for yourself?\\xa0 Ms. Vargas, can you put yourself in the shoes of the defendant who is fighting for their rights and wondering if you, as a judge, are going to be fair in your verdict?” Mr. Murphy responded that, “I believe I can switch from the role of an advocate to the role of a neutral arbiter successfully… I have tried many cases to a verdict in front of a jury and understanding how the judge in each of those cases provides a forum that allows both advocates to present their case fairly and fully such that they feel like their side of the house has been heard completely by the time the case is decided by the finder of fact…[It] is something I would seek to emulate and I think I can make that transition from being an advocate to being a neutral arbiter.” Ms. Vargas responded that, “I have litigated on both sides frequently both as plaintiff attorney and defense counsel. That has been a large part of my experience and has given me a breath of experience and a depth of understanding of what it means to be both a plaintiff’s counsel, a prosecutor, as well as on the defense side… If I were so lucky to be confirmed, I would look forward to taking on a role where fidelity to the rule of law would be my paramount consideration.” Video of Durbin’s questions for the District Court nominees in Committee is available here.

       " \"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and U.S. Senator Roger Marshall, M.D. (R-KS) along with the National Restaurant Association and restaurant operators from Illinois and Kansas, held a press conference on the need to pass their Credit Card Competition Act, bipartisan legislation that would enhance competition and choice in the credit card network market, which is currently dominated by the Visa-Mastercard duopoly.\\xa0 Swipe fees are the third most expensive cost restaurant operators have to manage—behind only food and labor costs.\\xa0 It is estimated that businesses paid more than $100 billion in swipe fees on Visa- and Mastercard-branded cards in 2023 alone. Durbin and Marshall were joined by Adam R. Mills, President & CEO, Kansas Restaurant & Hospitality Association; Kevin Vaughan, Owner of Vaughan Hospitality Group, Chicago, Illinois; Janez Lomshek, Owner of Talk of the Town & The Bullpen, Overland Park & Leawood, Kansas; Dan Raskin, Owner of Manny’s Deli, Chicago, Illinois; and Jennifer Ray, Owner of The Monarch, Wichita, Kansas. “When I visit restaurants and retailers back home in Illinois, the first thing they ask me is, ‘what are you going to do about credit card swipe fees?’” Durbin said. “There is no negotiation or competition.\\xa0 Our restaurant owners have no choice but to accept the outrageous fees, which are set around three percent.\\xa0 That’s why I worked with Sen. Marshall to introduce the Credit Card Competition Act, which would introduce competition and choice to the credit card market and bring down excessive fees.\\xa0 We’re fighting for the retailers and restaurant owners across America who are asking for economic fairness.” “Hidden Swipe fees are inflation multipliers that are crushing our small businesses across the country. I have heard time and time again from Kansas merchants that Credit Card swipe fees are one of their businesses' highest costs, often topping utilities, rent, and even employees' health care. Majority Whip Dick Durbin and I will continue fighting for Main Street over Wall Street with our legislation, the Credit Card Competition Act, that would inject competition in the payment processing industry and ultimately drive down costs for businesses and consumers. I was proud to be joined by Kansas restaurant owners who shared their stories of the impacts these predatory swipe fees have on their business- these are the realities that the mega-Wall Street banks, Visa, and Mastercard do not want people to hear,” said Marshall. “Hundreds of restaurant owners from around the country convened in Washington to share their perspective with Congress on why the Credit Card Competition Act would be game changing for all small business owners and would save customers thousands of dollars a year.\\xa0 We appreciate Sens. Durbin and Marshall’s unwavering commitment to the CCCA and the relief that it would bring restaurant operators in Illinois and Kansas. We were proud to stand with them today and share our stories,” said Sean Kennedy, Executive Vice President of Public Affairs for the National Restaurant Association. Building off of debit card competition reforms enacted by Congress in 2010, the Credit Card Competition Act would direct the Federal Reserve to ensure that the largest credit card-issuing banks offer a choice of at least two networks, one of which must be a network other than Visa and Mastercard, over which an electronic credit transaction may be processed.\\xa0 U.S. Senators Peter Welch (D-VT), J.D. Vance (R-OH), Jack Reed (D-RI), and Josh Hawley (R-MO) are cosponsors of the legislation, which is estimated to save merchants and consumers $15 billion each year. Photos of the press conference can be found here. A livestream can be found on Facebook here and X (formerly known as Twitter) here. Visa and Mastercard wield enormous market power in credit cards; according to the Federal Reserve, they account for nearly 576 million cards, or about 83 percent of general-purpose credit cards.\\xa0 Visa’s and Mastercard’s market power and network structure have enabled them to impose fees on U.S. merchants that are among the world’s highest, charging more than $100 billion in U.S. merchant credit card fees in 2023.\\xa0\\xa0 These fees include interchange fees which Visa and Mastercard require merchants to pay to issuing banks, as well as network fees that Visa and Mastercard require merchants to pay directly to them.\\xa0 Consumers ultimately pay for all of these fees in the price of the goods and services they buy.\\xa0 -30-\",\n",

The nominations advanced include five judicial nominees, two nominees to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, two U.S. Attorney nominees, and one U.S. Marshal nominee. “As we have since Senate Democrats took back the majority in 2021, we’re moving forward with strength to confirm highly qualified, diverse judicial nominees. Now, we’ve reported 210 lifetime judicial nominees to the full Senate, where we’ve confirmed 193. Our justice system is stronger when it’s reflective of America, and I’ll continue encouraging my Republican and Democratic colleagues to engage with the White House to identify and advance nominees to lifetime posts on the federal bench,” said U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Following today’s meeting, the Senate Judiciary Committee has reported 210 Article III judges to the full Senate – and the Senate has confirmed 193 judges to lifetime appointments on the federal bench – under the leadership of Chair Durbin.

       " 'WASHINGTON – U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today applauded the bipartisan United States Sentencing Commission’s unanimous vote to restrict conduct for which a person was acquitted in federal court from being used in calculating a sentence range under the federal sentencing guidelines.\\xa0 The vote comes after Durbin and U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA), along with U.S. Representatives Steve Cohen (D-TN-09) and Kelly Armstrong (R-ND-At-Large), previously introduced the bipartisan, bicameral Prohibiting Punishment of Acquitted Conduct Act of 2023.\\xa0 This legislation would statutorily end the unjust practice of judges increasing sentences based on conduct for which a defendant has been acquitted by a jury.\\xa0 “Under our Constitution, defendants can only be convicted of a crime if a jury of their peers finds they are guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\\xa0 However, federal law inexplicably allows judges to override a jury verdict of ‘not guilty’ by sentencing defendants based on acquitted conduct.\\xa0 This practice is inconsistent with the Constitution’s guarantees of due process and the right to a jury trial,” Durbin said.\\xa0 “That’s why I applaud the Sentencing Commission’s important step to limit the use of acquitted conduct.\\xa0 This unjust practice must be prohibited under federal law.” Our criminal justice system rests on the Fifth and Sixth Amendment guarantees of due process and the right to a jury trial for the criminally accused.\\xa0 These principles require the government to prove a defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury.\\xa0 Under the Constitution, defendants may be convicted only for conduct proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\\xa0\\xa0 However, at sentencing, courts may enhance sentences if they find, by the lower preponderance of the evidence standard, that a defendant committed other crimes.\\xa0 The difference in those standards of proof means that a sentencing court can effectively nullify a jury’s verdict by considering acquitted conduct. One prominent example of this unjust practice is the 2005 case of Antwuan Ball, who, along with his co-defendants, was convicted of distributing a few grams of crack cocaine, but acquitted of conspiring to distribute a much larger quantity of drugs. Despite this, the sentencing judge held Mr. Ball responsible for the conspiracy, nearly quadrupling his sentence to 19 years.\\xa0 Mr. Ball asked the Supreme Court to consider his case, but the Court denied the petition for the writ of certiorari.\\xa0 Justice Scalia wrote a blistering dissent, joined by Justices Ginsburg and Thomas, noting that “not only did no jury convict these defendants of the offense the sentencing judge thought them guilty of, but a jury acquitted them of that offense.”\\xa0 Scalia decried the practice, writing that, “this has gone on long enough.” The Prohibiting Punishment of Acquitted Conduct Act would statutorily end this practice by: Bill text is available here. -30-',\n",

Preventing the intrusive and all too often corrupt federal government from warrantless access to private communications is crucial to preserving civil liberties and the Fourth Amendment rights of every American. This bipartisan amendment with Senators Durbin, Lee, and Hirono makes meaningful progress toward protecting our citizens’ Constitutional liberties, as it strengthens the safeguards against unwarranted government surveillance. I urge my colleagues to support it,” said Cramer. Along with Durbin and Cramer, the amendment is cosponsored by Senators Mazie Hirono (D-HI) and Mike Lee (R-UT).

       " 'WASHINGTON\\xa0–\\xa0U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today had a phone conversation with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director (USCIS), Ur M. Jaddou, about recent processing delays for renewal applications and work permits for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients.\\xa0 During the call, Durbin received a commitment from Director Jaddou that USCIS is improving\\xa0processing for DACA recipients around the country Today’s call comes after Durbin and U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-CA), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Immigration Subcommittee, along with 26 of their colleagues, sent a letter to USCIS about these delays.\\xa0 Many applicants for DACA renewal have reported waiting well over five months for their applications to be processed this fiscal year.\\xa0 USCIS median processing times doubled from fiscal year (FY) 2022 to FY 2023, and so far in FY 2024 (through February 28, 2024) are 90 percent longer than in FY 2023. During the call and as previously laid out in the letter, Durbin again requested that USCIS amend its practices to prevent undue harm to DACA recipients, by starting an approved renewal applicant’s DACA period on the date of expiration of the previous period, rather than the current practice of starting the renewal period from the date of approval.\\xa0 This would prevent DACA recipients from accruing unlawful presence through no fault of their own due to processing delays.\\xa0 It would be consistent with USCIS’ approach to the renewal or extension of other immigration benefits. “The DACA program has allowed more than 834,000 Dreamers an opportunity to pursue higher education and meaningful careers while remaining in the only home they have ever known,” said Durbin.\\xa0 “Delays in processing DACA renewals are adding to the instability and uncertainty that DACA recipients already face each day—that’s why I’m urging USCIS to process these applications in a timely manner.\\xa0 I’m thankful for Director Jaddou’s commitment and am hopeful we can resolve this issue as soon as possible.” The reported median processing time of 1.9 months for renewals for FY 2024 thus far is the highest since FY 2017.\\xa0 USCIS data also shows significant increases in pending application volumes (to their highest total in three years) in addition to past decreases in the quarterly rate of adjudication.\\xa0 At the same time, deferred action for over 150,000 active DACA recipients will expire between March and September of this year, likely resulting in a significant number of new renewal filings. More than 20 years ago, Durbin first introduced the\\xa0Dream Act.\\xa0 In 2010, Durbin sent a letter, joined by then-Senator Richard Lugar (R-IN), asking then-President Obama to stop the deportation of Dreamers.\\xa0 Nearly 12 years ago, President Obama responded by announcing the DACA program.\\xa0 More than 800,000 Dreamers have since come forward and received DACA, which has allowed them to contribute more fully to their country as teachers, nurses, doctors, engineers, and small business owners.\\xa0 Last year, the Biden Administration issued a regulation fortifying and strengthening the DACA program. \\xa0Dreamers are protected from deportation for now, but due to lawsuits by extreme MAGA Republicans, their fates are in the hands of a Republican-appointed judge who has repeatedly found DACA and other programs like it unlawful. Last September, that federal judge in Texas declared the new DACA regulation illegal.\\xa0 Though the decision left in place protections for current DACA recipients while an appeal is pending, they live in fear that the next court decision will upend their lives. The\\xa0Dream Act\\xa0was also included in the 2013 comprehensive immigration reform bill that Durbin coauthored as part of the “Gang of Eight”—four Democrats and four Republicans.\\xa0 The 2013 bill passed the Senate on a strong bipartisan vote of 68-32, but the Republican leadership of the House of Representatives refused to consider it.\\xa0 Over the years, Senate Republicans have filibustered the\\xa0Dream Act\\xa0at least five times. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 -30-',\n",

The Forever Chemical Regulation and Accountability Act would initiate a National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine study to review the persistence, bioaccumulation, and human health risks of PFAS and document current uses to provide guidance on designating essential uses.\\xa0 The resulting guidance would be used to mitigate potential points of exposure and contamination while ensuring access to essential PFAS, such as those used in batteries and medical devices.\\xa0 This legislation prohibits excessive, non-essential PFAS uses and releasesof any PFAS into air, water, or land. The bill would also institute a realistic and manageable timeline of 10 years for PFAS manufacturers to stop production of all non-essential PFAS and to eliminate all PFAS releases from their facilities.\\xa0 Further, the Forever Chemical Regulation and Accountability Act would address state statutes of repose and certain bankruptcy maneuvers to make sure those responsible for harms due to certain regulated substances, such as PFAS, do not evade liability. “Protecting our environment and Americans from toxic hazards like PFAS is a matter of public health.\\xa0 PFAS surround us.\\xa0 They are in the pots and pans we cook with, in our drinking water supply, in the air we breathe.\\xa0 We must act to ensure that harm brought on by these ‘forever chemicals’ is mitigated,” said Durbin.\\xa0 “With the Forever Chemical Regulation and Accountability Act, we can work toward phasing out the unnecessary uses of PFAS, protecting consumers and our environment from the hazards of these chemicals.” “Today, Senator Durbin and I are taking action to set a 10-year national deadline to eliminate PFAS where possible, while closely monitoring exemptions where it is currently unavoidable for certain critical purposes—in life-saving medical devices and advanced computing, among other uses with important medical and national security implications,” said McCollum. “This legislation builds on the leadership of Minnesota’s elected officials, who passed Amara’s Law to protect the health of our residents and confront environmental contamination through a ban on non-essential uses of PFAS. Our legislation would establish a federal ban, while also investing in research and ensuring thoughtful, science-backed safeguards that keep people safe and healthy. All across America, our communities deserve clean and safe water to drink, and I am proud to join Senator Durbin in introducing the bicameral Forever Chemical Regulation and Accountability Act.”\\xa0 The Forever Chemical Regulation and Accountability Act would: PFAS are a class of chemicals that are highly toxic and can even be harmful at low doses.\\xa0 They are considered “forever chemicals” as they do not breakdown easily and can accumulate in people, food, and the environment.\\xa0 People can be exposed by consuming PFAS-contaminated water or food or by using products that contain PFAS such as food packaging or non-stick cooking surfaces.\\xa0 Despite preliminary evidence showing the chemicals’ toxicity as early as the 1960s, these dangers were not publicly known until the late 1990s.\\xa0 \\xa0It is estimated 99 percent of Americans have PFAS in their blood. \\xa0PFAS have been linked to serious illnesses, including several types of cancer, birth defects, and thyroid disease.

Durbin, along with U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND), today filed a bipartisan amendment to RISAthat would require the government to obtain a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) before reviewing the contents of Americans’ private communications.\\xa0 Requiring the government to obtain court approval before accessing the content of Americans’ private communications that get swept up in Section 702 surveillance would protect Americans while preserving Section 702 as a foreign intelligence collection tool.\\xa0 The amendment is based on language from Durbin’s bipartisan Security and Freedom Enhancement (SAFE) Act, a compromise bill that protects Americans from foreign threats and from warrantless government surveillance. “I have never questioned that Section 702 is a valuable tool forcollecting foreign intelligence.\\xa0 Congress’ intention when we passed Section 702 was clear as could be—FISA Section 702 is supposed to be used only for spying on foreigners abroad.\\xa0 Instead, sadly, it has enabled warrantless access to vast databases of American’s private phone calls, text messages, and e-mails,” Durbin said.\\xa0 During his speech, Durbin also cautioned against rushing to pass the House bill as is because FISA Section 702 will sunset on April 19. “Last Friday, the House of Representatives passed an alarming bill.\\xa0 It is misleadingly called the Reforming Intelligence and Securing America Act.\\xa0 Rather than fixing the flaws in Section 702, the House bill will dangerously and unnecessarily expand it.\\xa0 The Senate is now rushing to pass the House bill as is, because FISA Section 702 will sunset on April 19.\\xa0 But that is a false choice.\\xa0 No member should be fooled into believing Section 702 will go dark and not be available to be used on April 20 if we do nothing,” Durbin said.\\xa0 Durbin continued, “We planned for this exact scenario by providing clear statutory authority to continue surveillance under existing orders from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, known as FISC, after Section 702 nominally expires.\\xa0 In fact, the U.S. Department of Justice has already obtained a fresh one-year certification from this Court to continue Section 702 surveillance through April of 2025… there is no need for the Senate to swallow whole a House bill that expands—rather than reforms—Section 702.” Durbin went on to explain the need for his narrow warrant requirement amendment that he filed today with Senator Cramer. “If the government wants to spy on my private communications or the private communications of any American, they should be required to get approval from a judge, just as our Founding Fathers intended in writing the Constitution,” Durbin said.\\xa0 “A bipartisan amendment in the House would have required the government to obtain a warrant before searching Section 702 databases for the communications of American citizens. But this critical reform narrowly failed on a tie vote, 212-212.\\xa0 I want to offer a narrower amendment that would only require the government to obtain a warrant in a small fraction of situations where it actually wants to read or listen to private communications of American citizens… this pragmatic approach, respecting the Constitution, will safeguard American privacy and still preserve Section 702’s critical value forcollecting foreign intelligence and protecting national security.” Durbin concluded, “Congress has a responsibility to the American people to get this right. I recognize the importance of Section 702, but we should not rubberstamp the House’s flawed bill where surveillance is already authorized until April 2025.\\xa0 I want to respect the need for Section 702, but I’m sworn to respect the need to follow this Constitution.

In their letter, the senators emphasized the proposal’s effects on Colorado’s workforce and called on USPS to identify ways to promote workforce recruitment and retention.\\xa0 “We understand that USPS’s decision to shift to a model that consolidates distribution centers is the result of a larger USPS review of all its facilities and equipment with the dual goal to cut costs and ensure resources are maximized. However, it is critical that mail service is not compromised in the process and the outcomes are sustainable for rural communities over the long term,” the senators wrote. Bennet has consistently pushed USPS to address mail service issues in Colorado. Last month, he joined 20 Senate colleagues urging USPS to stop any changes that could result in job losses and further degrade mail delivery performance for Colorado and states across the country. Last year, Bennet invited DeJoy to tour a mail facility in Colorado to see the ongoing service and delivery challenges that Coloradans face. Earlier this year, Bennet called on DeJoy to address persistent delivery issues identified by a USPS audit of mail service in Colorado’s mountain communities.\\xa0 The text of the letter is available HERE and below.\\xa0 Dear Postmaster General DeJoy,\\xa0 The United States Postal Service (USPS) plays a particularly important role in rural communities across America where residents rely heavily on mail parcels, including prescription medication and medical equipment, election materials, and bills. While we appreciate USPS’s efforts to improve mail delivery systems through the Delivering for America plan, we have serious questions regarding the recent proposal to consolidate Processing and Distribution Centers (P&DC), including changing the Grand Junction Processing and Distribution Center (GJ P&DC) to a Local Processing Center (LPC), and to transport local mail with a local destination, over 500 miles round trip, between Grand Junction and Denver for sorting. We request more information regarding these changes and seek to ensure they do not increase mail delivery speeds or add to existing workforce challenges. Please carefully consider the following feedback, and provide the requested information to ensure transparency throughout the ongoing review process.\\xa0 Mail Processing Concerns USPS’s proposal to redirect local mail from Grand Junction to Denver has raised concerns from several municipal leaders across Colorado’s Western Slope. During the winter and spring, the I-70 corridor often experiences delayed travel due to hazardous winter conditions and mudslides. We are concerned that USPS’s plan could impact local mail delivery when these delays occur, which is alarming when constituents already suffer from inconsistent and unreliable mail service.\\xa0 Further, we are concerned that the decision to route additional local mail to the Denver facility from other population centers in Wyoming and Nebraska could exacerbate mail distribution issues in the region and contribute to further delays and inconsistencies in the Denver P&DC facility. USPS’s Office of the Inspector General’s (OIG’s) 2021 audit already identified several processing and delivery inconsistencies in the Denver facility.\\xa0 Given that USPS’s new plan will transport even more mail into and out of the Denver P&DC facility, we seek a better understanding of the investments and improvements to be made to the Denver facility and the timeline for their completion.\\xa0 Workforce Concerns In addition, we know that this plan, if implemented, will impact Colorado’s workforce. While we trust that the changes under this plan will help USPS to remain nimble and competitive with their delivery service peers, we want to make sure that these plans are not disruptive to existing efforts to strengthen Colorado’s rural USPS workforce. We encourage USPS to identify ways to maximize on-ramps for non-career staff to transition to career staff positions through this plan. We also look forward to partnering with USPS’s Chief Human Resources Officer to identify long-term strategies to promote workforce recruitment and retention, including providing payment increases, as recommended in the recent USPS OIG report.\\xa0\\xa0 Conclusion We understand that USPS’s decision to shift to a model that consolidates distribution centers is the result of a larger USPS review of all its facilities and equipment with the dual goal to cut costs and ensure resources are maximized. However, it is critical that mail service is not compromised in the process and the outcomes are sustainable for rural communities over the long term. We stand ready to help amplify information about these plans in the future. We also request that you answer the following questions to assist us in providing the best information to constituents.\\xa0 1) Has USPS outlined specific contingency plans to help workers from the various local processing centers safely navigate the routes to and from Denver in the event of inclement weather or other road hazards?\\xa0 2) How is USPS planning to overcome weather-related delays given regular inclement weather and other road hazards? 3) How many households and businesses are currently served by the Grand Junction and Denver processing and delivery facilities? How many additional households will Denver serve under this new plan, including the households in Wyoming and Nebraska?\\xa0 4) What specific measures are USPS considering to help make sure the Denver facility is adequately staffed to accommodate the new incoming mail? 5) What training will USPS provide personnel, including contractors and managers, if these plans are implemented, to ensure proper logistical processes are in place and to make sure workers maintain proper record keeping as the mail is transported between the local and regional facilities? 6) How is USPS planning to ensure that there are no career-staff layoffs? Additionally, is USPS considering plans to help mitigate non-career staff turnover? Thank you in advance for considering our feedback and answering our questions. We are monitoring this development closely. We look forward to staying in contact as you consider whether to implement the proposed plans and working with you to ensure that every Coloradan receives their mail in a timely manner.\\xa0 Sincerely,',\n",

The Conduit is the final phase of the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project, which Congress authorized in 1962. When completed, the Conduit will help bring clean drinking water to more than 50,000 people in 39 communities in the lower Arkansas Valley of Colorado who currently rely on naturally contaminated groundwater, which typically does not meet Safe Drinking Water Act standards. Colorado water providers have worked to finish the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project since Congress first authorized it. Annual funding, in line with our $13 million funding request for FY25, will help shorten the Conduit’s construction timeline and expand Coloradans’ access to a secure and safe supply of water. We join the Southeastern Colorado Water Conservancy District, the State of Colorado, and the many local water providers in support of $13 million for the Arkansas Valley Conduit. These funds will allow Coloradans to maintain on-time construction, delivery of pre-construction activities, including updating environmental documents, design activity, contract negotiation, land acquisition, and right of way work.\\xa0 Additionally, we request a strong overall FY25 funding level for the Bureau of Reclamation. While the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provided substantial and necessary funding for Western water infrastructure, the needs in our region will remain significant for years to come as these one-time historic funds come to an end.\\xa0 Thank you for your consideration of this request.\\xa0 Sincerely,\\xa0',\n",
       " \"Washington, D.C. — In case you missed it, Colorado U.S. Senator Michael Bennet addressed the urgent need for U.S. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-La.) to bring Ukraine aid to a vote on the House floor in an interview on Fox News, an op-ed in the Washington Examiner, and in response to criticism from U.S. Senator J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) on Twitter/X. On Fox News’ Special Report with Bret Baier, Bennet said:\\xa0 “I don't need to know that Ukraine has fought as bravely as they have for the last two years. I don't need to know that they've taken back half the territory that Putin stole from them, or that they've stood on the tip of the spear for democracy all over the world. I do know that, but that's only a benefit on top of our national security. “For $60 billion – that sounds like a lot of money. Compare that to the $3 trillion that we spent in the Middle East. You know, where we had our own troops on the ground dying in the Middle East.... I'm not going to say that that's cheap, but I am going to say that it's cheap compared to a lot of other investments that we've made, and far more effective... And I think that's actually what the math compels. “If we can get through this week and we can stand up for the country, maybe we could create a whole new politics here that actually supports the national interests of the country. That's what I think we're trying to do.” In an op-ed for the Washington Examiner, Bennet wrote: “Politicians hellbent on abandoning Ukraine — [Senator J.D.] Vance included — claim that the U.S. defense industrial base is already under strain. But they propose no solution to the problem, perhaps revealing that, rather than deterring our adversaries, their real scheme is old-fashioned, self-defeating American isolationism.\\xa0 “Today’s America Firsters also ignore that the bipartisan Senate bill they oppose would allow us to send Ukraine decades-old weapons systems while replacing them with more advanced versions. We will inject money and urgency into the U.S. defense industrial base while replenishing our stockpiles and creating jobs nationwide. In fact, most of the money we “spend on Ukraine” stays here in the United States.” “The United States and our partners have shown the world’s tyrants that democracies will stand up for one another when tested. Together, we have sent a strong message of deterrence to our adversaries — for trillions of dollars less than we spent in Afghanistan and Iraq and without deploying a single American soldier to the front.\\xa0 “Nevertheless, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) has refused to bring the bill (or any defense bill) to the House floor, even though a broad bipartisan majority would support it.\\xa0\\xa0 “House and Senate isolationists want us to cut and run on Ukraine in the name of preparing for the possibility of war with China. No one should wish for such a war ever to happen, but backing Ukraine is our best preparation and our best deterrence.\\xa0 “Especially in the wake of Iran’s attack on Israel, Republicans should hold this vote or accept history’s judgment that the modern-day America Firsters lost Ukraine — and put the United States in greater danger.” In response to a post by Vance criticizing his op-ed, Bennet wrote: “Thanks for reading my op-ed, JD, and for your critique. Take it from somebody who barely passed pre-calculus, we don’t need trigonometry to apply the relevant math here.” “The Supplemental you voted against includes nearly $35 billion for U.S.-based arms manufacturers to produce cutting-edge weaponry. “While the U.S. provides the bulk of support for Ukraine’s military, the EU has provided more–around $90 billion–than we have ($70 billion). “Ukraine has taken back 50% of the territory that Putin stole & destroyed or disabled around 30% of Russia’s warships with almost no navy. “Australia, Japan, and South Korea have sent over $9 billion to Ukraine.\\xa0 “That’s a lot of money for countries nowhere near the conflict. They know that letting Ukraine lose would make the world more dangerous. “One final equation – arming Ukraine gives them far more leverage to secure a noble end to this conflict.”\",\n",

The legislation would require the U.S. Department of Education to consider the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism when enforcing federal anti-discrimination laws. \"We have a responsibility to confront prejudice everywhere,\" said Bennet. \"As antisemitism rises here at home, this bipartisan legislation will ensure that the federal government has the resources it needs to investigate and penalize antisemitic discrimination on our college campuses.” “Antisemitism has no place on our college campuses – nor anywhere in our society,” said Hickenlooper. “We’re committed to fighting against antisemitism and hate of all forms.” “Hamas’ horrific terrorist attack on October 7 led to a dramatic increase in antisemitism on college campuses,” said Casey. “Amidst this appalling increase, we must do everything we can to protect Jewish students on college campuses. This bill will make sure that going forward, the Education Department will take action against all forms of antisemitic discrimination.” “Our nation’s institutions of higher learning have become hotbeds of antisemitism, especially in the wake of the brutal attacks against Israel and innocent civilians by Hamas and Iran,” said Scott. “It’s critical the Department of Education has the tools and resources it needs to investigate antisemitism and root out this vile hatred wherever it rears its ugly head.” The senators’ legislation comes as Jewish Americans experience an increase in antisemitic incidents nationwide, particularly in the months following Hamas’s terrorist attack on Israel on October 7th. Bennet and Hickenlooper have condemned the rise of antisemitic incidents in the U.S. and the displays of antisemitism on college campuses. In October, the senators called on the U.S. Department of Homeland and Federal Bureau of Investigation to protect Jewish Americans from antisemitic attacks.',\n",

This rule will play an essential role in safeguarding miners from cancers, silicosis and black lung disease, especially in Appalachia where black lung cases have been rapidly increasing in recent years. For generations, our brave coal miners have risked their lives to power our nation to greatness, and we will continue working together in the Senate to advance commonsense rules like this one to protect the health and welfare of these heroes,” the senators said. “We're grateful for the Agency's initiative in implementing a rule to tackle the increasing incidence of silica-related lung diseases among both coal and metal non-metal miners. The resurgence of these diseases, particularly affecting younger miners in their 30s and 40s, underscores the urgency of this issue. This measure is vital for safeguarding miners' well-being not only in the short term but throughout their careers. The UMWA’s focus now shifts to ensuring mining companies are held accountable,” said United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) International President Cecil E. Roberts. Last June, the Senators released a statement applauding the proposed rule and calling for its swift implementation. ###\",\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) hosted a news conference call with Youngstown Mayor Jamael Tito Brown to discuss bipartisan legislation to protect Ohioans from an increase in the cost of high-speed internet. The Affordable Connectivity Program reduces the cost of high-speed internet for more than one million Ohio households – in rural, suburban, and urban communities across the state. Brown’s bipartisan, bicameral Affordable Connectivity Program Extension Act would fully fund the program that was created through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which Brown helped to write and pass. The program is administered by the Federal Communications Commission, which projects the program will be fully exhausted by the end of this month – well ahead of the anticipated date included in the law. If the program is not extended, Ohioans could see their internet bills increase by $30 per month. “Every Ohio family should have high-speed internet. And you shouldn’t have to pay exorbitant prices for it,” said Brown. “This legislation will ensure the Affordable Connectivity Program continues, providing cost savings for Ohioans, and preventing families from having to make tough choices about whether they can afford their internet bills next month.” “Continuing the Affordable Connectivity Program for all of our Youngstown residents is critical, especially for our senior citizens.\\xa0 The extension of ACP will help continue to allow greater access to services and resources, such as telemedicine, connection with family members, and social connections. This ACP broadband incentive allows greater access for those who are most vulnerable and need internet connections to realize opportunities for growth.\\xa0I am glad to have Senator Brown on our side, leading the fight to extend this cost-lowering program, and protect Ohioans in the Valley from rising internet bills,” said Youngstown Mayor Jamael Tito Brown. Brown has long been an advocate for high-speed internet infrastructure. In August, he\\xa0announced\\xa0a $162.5 million federal investment for high-speed internet infrastructure and community projects in Ohio under the American Rescue Plan’s\\xa0Capital Projects Fund\\xa0(CPF).\\xa0In June, he\\xa0announced\\xa0a massive investment to expand high-speed internet access to bring high-speed internet to 183,000 Ohio households.

       " 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) announced he successfully pushed the Biden Administration to investigate China’s unfair trade practices that undercut American shipbuilding, threaten our national security, and hurt American workers. Brown previously called on the Administration in support of the United Steelworkers (USW)\\xa0petition\\xa0under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 to call on United States Trade Representative (USTR) Katherine Tai to initiate a full investigation into China’s unfair trade practices in the maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors. Today, the USTR announced they were heeding that call and launching an investigation into China. “We pushed the administration to launch this investigation to protect America’s maritime and shipbuilding industry,” said Brown. “Now we need measures to level the playing field against China and boost U.S shipbuilding to prevent dependence on foreign countries, prevent further loss of good-paying American jobs, and strengthen our national security.” Today, the Ambassador Katherine Tai announced that USTR accepted USW’s petition and is launching an investigation of China under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. Public comments will be accepted through May 22, 2024, and a public hearing will take place on May 29, 2024. Over the last 20 years, the United States has lost industrial shipbuilding capacity while China’s subsidized shipbuilding has only grown. Chinese state-owned enterprises and other facilities are now capable of producing over 1,000 ocean-going vessels a year, while the United States currently produces fewer than ten. While shipbuilding capacity, suppliers, and shipyards remain vital to the U.S. economy and national security, China’s uncompetitive trade practices have led to 25,000 domestic shipbuilding suppliers leaving the U.S. market over the past 20 years. ###',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, delivered the following opening statement at today’s hearing entitled, “Oversight of Federal Housing Regulators.” Sen. Brown’s remarks, as prepared for delivery follow: Home is a lot more than four walls and a roof. Home is where you go after a long day at work. It’s where your kids play and do their homework. It’s where you plan for the future and build wealth. It’s how millions of families join the middle class. Our homes are an anchor in our lives. But for too many families around the country, a home they can afford and build their life around feels out of reach. I hear it all across Ohio. I hear it from people in Lima – where a new building with 54 apartments for working families just opened. For those 54 apartments, they had 511 interested families. I hear it from rural Washington County, in Southeast Ohio, where they’ve struggled for years to build 48 homes for seniors.\\xa0\\xa0 And I hear it in Franklin County, in central Ohio, where the population has grown by 14 percent – to more than 1.3 million people – but housing supply hasn’t kept up and prices keep rising. With more people and not enough homes, 40 percent of renters in the county are paying more than they can afford for housing. And the county – with its world-class schools, skilled workers, and great quality of life – will only continue to grow. I hear these stories from across Ohio. And it’s not just happening in Ohio. Whether you’re in downtown Columbus or Minneapolis or rural South Dakota or Wyoming, the problem is the same – housing is too expensive. It has been for far too long. And one big reason is that we don’t have enough of it. For the past decade, rent has just kept going up and up. One-in-four renters pays more than half their income for rent. And when more than half of your income goes to rent every month, it’s hard to juggle all the bills you already have – let alone save for a down payment. High rent stops people from becoming homeowners. So many families think, if only I could come up with the down payment. The money for a down payment is what stands between millions of Americans and the dream of homeownership. That’s why my bill to support first generation homebuyers, Downpayment Toward Equity Act, and my HELPER Act, to allow law enforcement to buy homes in their communities, and other sources of downpayment assistance are so important.\\xa0\\xa0 Secretary Todman and Director Thompson, you know all of these challenges, because your agencies are at the center of our efforts to lower the cost of housing. Your agencies don’t build housing. But you’re on the front lines of our housing markets. Your job is to make sure that there’s affordable financing for the housing that builders and housing providers create, that families can get a mortgage to buy their first home, and that, as Americans get older, they can still live safely in their homes. And both of your agencies have announced changes that should help increase housing supply and bring down costs. Following calls from Senator Reed and me and others, HUD acted to improve access to financing for affordable rental housing through FHA and the Federal Financing Bank. This will help housing providers and states build and preserve more affordable housing for renters across the country. HUD’s long-overdue update to loan limits for manufactured housing and its new guidance to support conversions of old office space into homes will open up new housing options. At FHFA, you’ve eliminated up-front fees that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have in the past charged lower-income, first-time homebuyers and borrowers who couldn’t afford a big down payment. And you’ve also refocused Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks on their roles not just in the financial markets, but in helping to support housing that families and communities need. But the fact remains: housing prices are still far too high, and have been for years. And it will take all of us working together – housing providers and federal, state, and local governments – to lower costs. HUD and FHFA need to do more to be vigilant in ensuring that taxpayer money is actually serving families – not enriching shady landlords and wealthy investors. In Ohio and around the country, Wall Street firms and other outside investors swoop into communities, buy up properties, evict tenants, and drive up local housing prices. We should pass my Stop Predatory Investing Act to end their tax breaks for buying up single-family homes. And we need to ensure that all our housing agencies are on the same page and working to stop – not support – predatory business models. States and local governments have a lot of influence over the housing in their communities. And more and more cities and counties are making changes – like updates to zoning and shortening lengthy approval processes – to open up opportunities for new housing and expand access to affordable homeownership. HUD is a critical partner in supporting that work. Earlier this year, Franklin County Commissioners President Kevin Boyce testified in the Senate on behalf of the National Association of Counties about the critical role that CDBG, HOME, and the Housing Trust Fund play in helping counties of every size to address their housing needs. Local communities depend on this partnership.\\xa0 And even with more housing, some families working low-wage jobs and seniors on fixed incomes still won’t make enough to afford rent or a mortgage. HUD’s housing assistance programs are critical to keep rent affordable for millions of workers, veterans, seniors, and youth aging out of foster care who could face homelessness without them. HUD needs to make sure they work effectively and efficiently to serve our communities and protect our investments in affordable housing. And Congress also needs to do its part. Last month, this Committee had a hearing on legislative proposals to help expand our housing supply and bring down the cost of housing. We must continue our bipartisan work to move forward commonsense proposals that will help expand housing options and reduce costs, and I look forward to continuing to work with Ranking Member Scott and our colleagues on this Committee toward that goal. Today, I look forward to hearing from the two leaders before us about what they have done, what more they can do, and resources they need, and to get their input on what Congress can do to make housing more affordable for both renters and homeowners. ###',\n",

In a letter to the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citi, the Senators press the banks to provide data on wire fraud at their banks and information about their current policies to protect consumers from financial devastation. “Consumers use wire transfers to send large dollar amounts, often to purchase a home or make significant investments, meaning wire fraud is often a life-changing event that can wipe out consumers’ savings or irreparably damage their finances,” the Senators wrote. “Banks have a responsibility to proactively monitor and prevent unauthorized and fraudulently induced transactions. We believe banks should reimburse their customers when they fail to meet these obligations…. With improved fraud prevention and reimbursement practices, consumers would no longer be left on the hook to the tune of billions of dollars annually.” In 2023, consumers lost more than $10 billion due to fraud – up 14 percent from the year before. According to the Federal Trade Commission, in terms of dollars lost, “Bank Transfer or Payment” is the largest payment method used by fraudsters. Brown has long pushed to hold big financial institutions accountable to protect consumers from fraud and scams. Earlier this year, Brown and his colleagues pushed the CEO of Zelle to publicly clarify their reimbursement policy for imposter scams, reimburse customers for additional types of scams, and streamline the process for consumers to report unauthorized transactions, scams, and fraud. In December, he also pressed the CEOs of Venmo and Cash App to adopt new policies to reimburse consumers who get scammed, and make it easier for users to report scams and fraud on these platforms. ###',\n",

HUD’s been working with the City of Toledo,” said Brown. “Will you commit in front of this committee publicly to continuing to work with the city to see the job through and to fix the conditions at Ashland Manor and Covenant House, and to hold the landlords accountable?” “Absolutely and I made that commitment to the mayor of Toledo as well myself,” said Todman. “And I’ll be holding you to that.

In the letter, Brown called on Commissioner O’Malley to work with community members to alert those impacted about the closure and to ensure that Ohioans continue to have access to the services they count on, especially those without reliable internet access or who require in-person appointments. Brown also committed to working with his colleagues to ensure the Social Security Administration has the resources it needs to prevent future office closures. “I urge you to take all necessary steps to ensure Ohioans continue to have access to the services they count on and to take all necessary steps to reopen the Warrensville Heights office as soon as possible,” wrote Brown. The letter is available here and below. Dear Commissioner O’Malley: I write regarding your announcement that you plan to close the Cleveland Southeast Social Security field office in Warrensville Heights for 90 days. I urge you to take all necessary steps to ensure Ohioans continue to have access to the services they count on and to take all necessary steps to reopen the Warrensville Heights office as soon as possible. Social Security is our government’s promise to working men and women and is the bedrock of our middle class. This includes those who receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), which the Social Security Administration (SSA) also administers. More than one-in-six Ohioans receive Social Security benefits, and many depend on Social Security for nearly all their income. Given Social Security’s importance, it is crucial that beneficiaries and their families have access to the services that physical Social Security field offices provide. In the weeks ahead, I ask that you do all you can to ensure Clevelanders and others who count on the Warrensville Heights field office for SSA services are aware of the closure and can continue to access those services uninterrupted during those months. As you review your agency’s presence in Cleveland to develop a more long-term strategy, I ask that you work directly with community members to ensure all beneficiaries in Cuyahoga County and beyond have access to in-person SSA services and can count on receiving their benefits in full and on-time. I urge you to reopen the Warrensville Heights location as soon as possible. Thank you for your attention. I look forward to your prompt response. Sincerely, Sherrod Brown ###',\n",

This waiver will expand markets for Ohio farmers and promote American fuel independence while lowering fuel costs for drivers in Ohio and across the country. Brown is a senior member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. “Relying on American farmers for clean, reliable biofuels – like E15 – is a better energy solution than depending on foreign competitors,” said Brown. “We pushed to expand the use of E15 now to send an important signal to manufacturers, consumers, and gas stations, which should help to lower energy prices throughout the summer all while expanding markets for Ohio farmers.” “Year-round access to higher blends of ethanol is a win for consumers, fuel retailers and corn growers alike. Senator Brown has been on the front lines of this fight and we're grateful for his hard work to bring his colleagues to the table and engage with the administration. Today’s announcement is another signal that the time for more biofuels is here. Ohio’s corn growers are ready to deliver high quality, low carbon, less expensive fuels right away,” said Tadd Nicholson, Executive Director, Ohio Corn & Wheat Growers Association. Brown has long been an advocate for lowering energy prices by using American-grown ethanol. Last month, the Ohio Corn & Wheat Growers Association awarded Brown the Ohio Corn & Wheat Guardian Award for his leadership in advocating for Ohio grain farmers. In March 2023, Brown introduced the bipartisan\\xa0Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act of 2023 which would enable the year-round, nationwide sale of ethanol blends higher than 10 percent, helping to lower fuel prices, support Ohio farmers, and provide price stability for consumers.

       " '\\n18 Apr.\\n WASHINGTON, DC – Today, Congressman Alex X. Mooney reintroduced the Protecting Life in Health Savings Accounts Act (H.R 8049). This legislation would end the preferential tax treatment of abortion by prohibiting the life-taking procedure from being counted as an eligible medical procedure and exclude elective abortions from being paid for out of various types of health savings accounts. Abortion is not health care and should not be considered a medical expense. Seven House Republicans joined the bill as original cosponsors: Reps. Matt Rosendale, Jeff Duncan, Mary Miller, Dan Crenshaw, Paul Gosar, Bob Good, and Daniel Webster. Senator Mike Lee introduced this legislation in the Senate. “The sanctity of life continues to be under assault by President Joe Biden’s Administration. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has made it easier to acquire abortion pills by mail. Post offices are being converted into local abortion clinics. The radical pro-abortion movement is doing anything they can to keep access to abortion as easy and frequent as possible,” said Congressman Alex X. Mooney. “Protecting life is one of my top priorities in Congress. Abortion should not be paid for by the taxpayer and should not hold any special privileges when it comes to tax incentives,” Mooney added. Background: Federal law allows individuals to use tax-advantaged funds in health savings accounts (HSAs), flexible savings accounts (FSAs), health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs), Archer medical savings accounts (MSAs), and retiree health accounts to cover their medical expenses. These accounts allow users to set aside money on a pre-tax basis to pay for qualified medical expenses. These accounts can help pay for deductibles, copays, and medical procedures. Unfortunately, the IRS categorizes elective abortions as an eligible medical expense to be paid using these tax-advantaged savings accounts. The Protecting Life in Health Savings Accounts is the House companion to legislation introduced by Senator Mike Lee of Utah in the United States Senate. Fax: (202) 225-7856',\n",

It’s critical the Department of Education has the tools and resources it needs to investigate antisemitism and root out this vile hatred wherever it rears its ugly head.” \\xa0 The Antisemitism Awareness Act would make permanent the Department of Education’s usage of the IHRA’s definition of antisemitism, which is a vital tool helping to clarify and identify the various manifestations of antisemitism. Since 2018, the Department of Education has used the IHRA definition when investigating violations of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This definition is supported by President Biden’s Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism, was included in President Biden’s National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism, and has been used by the State Department since the Obama Administration.\\xa0 \\xa0 In addition to Senators Rick Scott, Bob Casey and Tim Scott, the Antisemitism Awareness Act is cosponsored by U.S. Senators Jacky Rosen (D-NV), James Lankford (R-OK), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), John Boozman (R-AR), Christopher Coons (D-DE), Susan Collins (R-ME), Kyrsten Sinema (I-AZ), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Kristen Gillibrand (D-NY), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), John Hickenlooper (D-CO),\\xa0Josh Hawley (R-MO), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Katie Britt (R-AL), John Fetterman (D-PA), Pete Ricketts (R-NE), Ben Cardin (D-MD), John Barrasso (R-WY), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), John Cornyn (R-TX), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV). \\xa0 The Antisemitism Awareness Act builds off of Senator Rick Scott’s resolution condemning antisemitism and embracing the widely-accepted IHRA definition of antisemitism. This resolution reinforces that any hatred toward the Jewish community or delegitimization of the state of Israel is indeed antisemitism and sends a strong message that the full force of the federal government is leading the charge against antisemitism of any kind. This resolution, announced back in June, followed the Biden administration’s decision not to codify this commonly-used and widely-accepted definition in its national strategy to counter antisemitism, and is endorsed by the Republican Jewish Coalition, the Zionist Organization of America and NORPAC. \\xa0 Read more about Senator Scott’s recent visit to Israel HERE.

The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) provides legal and financial protections to active duty servicemembers, including National Guard and reserve members, and their families; however, the benefit is often underutilized, according to a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau report. \\xa0 The bipartisan bill would expand existing financial literacy programs to include information about these protections; require the Department of Defense’s annual survey to include information about these programs; include benefit information on all activation orders; and require creditors to apply a 6 percent cap to all eligible accounts under their jurisdiction once a servicemember invokes their SCRA rights. \\xa0 Senator Rick Scott said, “Our servicemembers who put everything on the line don’t deserve to be taken advantage of—especially when it comes to their financials. I am proud to join my colleague Senator Ossoff to lead the bipartisan SCRA Benefit Utilization Act that will provide more ease and access to the legal and financial protections our active duty members are entitled to for their personal, auto and student loans, as well as increase financial literacy resources. We must continue to protect our servicemembers, especially as these brave Americans serve our country and protect our freedoms.” \\xa0 Senator Jon Ossoff said, “Georgia’s servicemembers and their families deserve the very best, yet many are unaware of key benefits to help them save money. I’m introducing this new bipartisan bill to expand access to these key financial protections for our heroic servicemembers and help them save money and build wealth.” \\xa0 Companion legislation was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by Congressman Matt Cartwright (PA-08). \\xa0 Congressman Matt Cartwright said, “Financial issues should not distract our brave men and women in uniform from their mission.

Secretary Mayorkas has ordered laws to be ignored, allowed terrorists on the FBI’s Terrorist Watchlist and migrants with known gang affiliations to stream into our country to such an extent that the FBI Director testifies before Congress that this is the most dangerous time in America since 9/11, and let fentanyl continue to pour into and ravage the country. \\xa0  \\xa0 Read Senator Scott’s remarks as prepared for delivery below: \\xa0 Democrats’ assault on American Democracy had a banner day today. \\xa0 Today, Democrats in the Senate said that impeachments by the United States House of Representatives don’t matter.  \\xa0 According to what Democrats did today, we don’t need to hold impeachment trials here in the Senate. \\xa0 It doesn’t matter if, for example, you are a cabinet secretary that has instructed his agency to ignore the law and not execute the laws of the United States. \\xa0 It doesn’t matter if, by ordering an agency to ignore the laws of the United States, Americans are murdered. \\xa0 It doesn’t matter if, by ordering an agency to ignore the laws of the United States, deadly fentanyl pours into our communities and poisons our children. \\xa0 It doesn’t matter if, by ordering an agency to ignore the laws of the United States, terrorists on the FBI’s Terrorist Watchlist and migrants with known gang affiliations stream into our country to such an extent that the FBI Director testifies before Congress that this is the most dangerous time in America since 9/11. \\xa0 I want everyone to pause and think about their family for a moment. \\xa0 Think about your spouse, mom or dad, your kids. Think about those you love.  \\xa0 For thousands of American families, the person they are thinking about is dead. \\xa0 Mr./ Madam President – I want to say that again… \\xa0 For thousands of American families, the person they are thinking about is DEAD. Taken too soon by the deadly fentanyl crisis that has ravaged our nation because of the wide open southern border. \\xa0 Every one of us has families in our state that have been ripped apart by the deadly fentanyl crisis. Some of us have been impacted by this directly in our own families. \\xa0 Fentanyl is killing more than 70,000 Americans a year.  \\xa0 That’s 70,000 families being torn apart because our border is not secured. \\xa0 That is happening, in part, because instead of letting our brave border patrol agents do their job and stop these deadly drugs, Secretary Mayorkas is using them to let even more people who illegally crossed the border come into our country and get all sorts of nice services - phones, lawyers, hotels rooms - paid for by U.S. taxpayers.  \\xa0 Every victim of Secretary Mayorkas’s order for his agency to ignore the law has a name. \\xa0 I’ve heard so many heartbreaking stories from folks in my state. \\xa0 Florida families are feeling the impact of this administration’s lawless border policies every single day, as deadly fentanyl, criminals and terrorists pour across Biden’s open borders.  \\xa0 There were 1,145 children between 14-18 years old who died from fentanyl in 2021. That’s a classroom of students dying every week. \\xa0 In 2022, I heard from a mom in Kissimmee, Florida whose son had a future in the Air Force, and came home to visit her on Mother’s Day Weekend.  \\xa0 He visited an old friend, who he didn’t know had begun dealing drugs.  \\xa0 The friend convinced the young man to take a Xanax, which was unknowingly laced with Fentanyl, and the mom found him dead. \\xa0 Just imagine what that mom is going through. To find her own son dead. It’s unimaginable. \\xa0 26-year-old Ashley Dunn is another American we’ve lost to fentanyl poisoning.\\xa0  \\xa0 Ashley’s mother, Josephine Dunn, says that her daughter did not overdose, but was “poisoned by one-half of one Percocet tablet that was counterfeit…” \\xa0 According to Ms. Dunn, her daughter “was murdered by products made in Mexico” that were welcomed into this country “by Mayorkas and this administration.”  \\xa0 Today, Senate Democrats made certain that Secretary Mayorkas will never have to answer for Ashley’s death or any of the other deaths that his lawless agenda have caused.  \\xa0 America is a more dangerous place because Mayorkas and Biden have allowed criminals, drugs, TERRORISTS, and other dangerous people into our communities. \\xa0 Real Americans with families are being killed. Real American families are being torn apart by vicious crimes and deadly drugs BECAUSE we have a wide open border. \\xa0 Secretary Mayorkas is the first and only sitting cabinet secretary to be impeached and now he has been forever blocked from being acquitted of that charge. \\xa0 He will never get that chance to be acquitted because of what Senate Democrats did today.  \\xa0 I still have a question for my Democrat colleagues: was Mayorkas silenced today because Democrats are terrified of his record and unable to defend him, or because they just don’t trust him? \\xa0 Whatever the answer is, the thing that every reporter here and every American needs to understand is this:  \\xa0 Democrats put politics over the safety of American families and the security of our great nation today. I fear the consequences of that unprecedented failure will be devastating beyond our worst fears. \\xa0 ###',\n",

The men and women serving in CBP and ICE are doing the best they can, but the horrific policies of Mayorkas and Biden make their jobs impossible. Today, more than 10 million people have illegally crossed and 6 million have been allowed to stay and had the red carpet rolled out for them courtesy of the American taxpayers because Secretary Mayorkas has failed to enforce the law and ordered his agency to ignore it. There have been sexual assaults and murders committed by illegal aliens all over the country – even in Florida, where a young man was recently killed. \\xa0 Senator Rick Scott said, “Everyone in America knows that Secretary Mayorkas is guilty of the crimes he was impeached for, and it is an insult to our democratic process that Senate Democrats destroyed our constitutional duty and failed to hold an impeachment trial. Today, I had one question that Secretary Mayorkas dismissed as quickly and ignorantly as Democrats dismissed his impeachment trial: does he think he was silenced and blocked from defending himself in an impeachment trial because Democrats are terrified of his record and unable to defend him, or because they don’t trust him? It’s clear to me that in the minds of the American people, both are true.” \\xa0  \\xa0 In the hearing, Senator Scott remarked, “Democrats voted AGAINST deporting illegal aliens who hurt police… like the violent attack on uniformed police officers in New York City by a group of illegal migrants – some of whom with known gang affiliations – who unlawfully entered the country under your watch. Democrats voted AGAINST the Laken Riley Act, which simply requires ICE to take illegal aliens who commit crimes into custody before tragedies strike. So, it seems to me that Democrats have no problem voting to keep this border crisis going and blocking every attempt that Republicans make to stop the crime and secure the border. But when it comes to you, they shut everything down and don’t let you speak.” \\xa0 Senator Scott questioned, “Do you think you are being silenced because Democrats are terrified of your record and unable to defend you, or because they don’t trust you?” \\xa0 Watch Senator Scott’s full remarks HERE or by clicking the photo above.  \\xa0 ###',\n",

Over and over again, SEC Chair Gensler has disregarded the real-world impacts of his aggressive regulatory agenda in his dogged pursuit of left-wing political priorities. This rule is no exception. The SEC’s mission is to regulate our capital markets and ensure all Americans can safely share in their economic success – not to force a partisan climate agenda on American businesses. This rule is federal overreach at its worst, and the SEC should stay in its lane,” said Ranking Member Scott. \\xa0 BACKGROUND Under Chair Gensler, the SEC has pursued one of the most aggressive regulatory agendas in the agency’s history – with the agency on track to propose and finalize over 60 rules with limited public comment periods and inadequate cost-benefit analyses. Through rigorous congressional oversight, Ranking Member Scott has continued to push back on the widespread impact and confusion created by agency’s proposed rules on our capital markets, American retirement savers, and businesses of all sizes. \\xa0 In February of 2023, Ranking Member Scott, Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.-10), and Chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.-04), sent a letter to Chair Gary Gensler demanding records and other information related to the proposed climate disclosure rule, including responses to previous requests by numerous members of both the House and the Senate that Chair Gensler has failed to provide. The Republican leaders emphasized that the proposed rule exceeds the SEC’s mission, expertise, and authority and – if finalized in any form – will unnecessarily harm consumers, workers, and the U.S. economy. \\xa0 Last June, Ranking Member Scott teamed up with the Chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.-01), to demand answers from the SEC about its role in facilitating the European Union’s (E.U.) progressive climate agenda, which could be imposed on American companies. Despite continued requests, the SEC has failed to produce documents around their involvement in the E.U.’s climate-related disclosure policies, as well as labor and social justice initiatives, that would harm a broad range of U.S. businesses and weaken U.S. capital markets. The SEC's actions and repeated stonewalling of congressional oversight are especially concerning given that the application of E.U. policies would circumvent U.S. regulatory and legal processes and allow foreign governments to dictate climate and economic policy to U.S. companies. \\xa0 At a hearing in September, the Ranking Member pressed Chair Gensler about the agency’s aggressive rulemaking, lack of transparency, and unresponsiveness to congressional inquiries. Ranking Member Scott had called for the Chair to testify since February 2023. Following the hearing, Capitol Account highlighted Chair Gensler’s refusal to respond to congressional oversight requests from Senate Banking Committee minority members. \\xa0 After the SEC’s announcement of the final climate disclosure rule, Ranking Member Scott declared his intent to use the Congressional Review Act process to fight the rule and its implementation, calling it, “federal overreach at its worst.”  \\xa0 ###\",\n",

This designation eliminates duplicity in permitting and helps protect Florida’s environment by allowing Florida to follow the state’s permitting program standards, which are just as stringent, if not more so, than what is currently in place on the federal level. The bill would also codify the dredge and fill permitting programs administered by the States of Michigan and New Jersey, and clarify the law so that other states may successfully navigate the process to assume this authority. \\xa0 In 2020, the State of Florida assumed Clean Water Act permitting authorities pursuant to procedures provided within the Clean Water Act, restoring the power of Floridians to decide permitting matters that affect them the most.

Senator Also Advocates Elimination of Tax on Veterinary Loan Repayment Program VIDEO: \\xa0Senator Hyde-Smith, Ag. Secretary Vilsack Discuss Emergency Forest Restoration Aid for Mississippi.VIDEO: \\xa0Senator Hyde-Smith Seeks to Overturn Tax that Hinders Veterinary Service in Rural Areas. WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today received a commitment from Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack for a smooth signup process for Mississippians applying for assistance through the Emergency Forest Restoration Program (EFRP). Hyde-Smith serves on the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee that received testimony from Vilsack at a hearing to review the FY2025 budget requests for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). \\xa0The Farm Service Agency (FSA) on Monday approved an extended 120-day signup period for EFRP aid throughout Mississippi, assistance sought by Hyde-Smith and other delegation members. “I am very relieved that forest landowners will be able to access these funds for costs associated with commercial thinning, firebreaks, and debris removal in fighting pine beetles,” Hyde-Smith said. “There is still a long road ahead in getting Mississippi forest landowners, homeowners, and municipalities back on their feet, and I’m continuing to explore multiple angles for assistance. \\xa0Still, this emergency forest restoration authorization is a huge step forward for landowners, and I want to make sure as many eligible Mississippians get help as soon as possible,” the Senator added, before asking and receiving Vilsack’s commitment to ensure a smooth EFRP signup process. Every Mississippi county is covered by a natural disaster designation related to extreme drought last year that has killed more than 12 million trees and led to pine beetle infestation. \\xa0Through EFRP, a cost-share program, Mississippians can qualify for financial and technical assistance to restore nonindustrial private forest land damaged by the drought and beetle infestation. Separately, Hyde-Smith commended Vilsack for a FY2025 budget recommendation that endorses passage of legislation to end an existing federal withholding tax imposed on Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program awards. \\xa0The tax greatly diminishes the impact of these loan repayment awards, which are intended to help offset the educational loans of veterinarians who agree to serve in USDA-designated rural veterinary shortage areas. “I truly appreciate your drawing attention to this issue,” Hyde-Smith told Vilsack. \\xa0“I think it is very important that Congress provides your Department with the statutory authority it needs to spend all of these appropriated dollars on actual awards for the veterinarians protecting our food supply and public health in rural communities.” Currently, USDA is required by law to send 39 percent of funds appropriated to the program back to the U.S. Treasury in the form of withholding taxes on behalf of award recipients. \\xa0Congress appropriated $10 million to this program in FY2024, but only $6.1 million will be used to ease the rural veterinary shortage—the remaining $3.9 million goes back to Treasury. Hyde-Smith, co-chair of the Senate Veterinary Medicine Caucus, has cosponsored the Rural Veterinary Workforce Act (S.2829), which would end the federal withholding tax on loan repayment awards for veterinarians who agree to serve for three years in USDA-designated rural veterinary shortage areas. Finally, Hyde-Smith submitted questions to Vilsack on what support is needed from Congress for the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) to reinstate critical market reports that it will either cancel or discontinue this year. Earlier this month, NASS announced it would eliminate Mississippi as a state included in its January estimates for categories including beef cows, dairy cows, heifers, and bulls. \\xa0NASS also announced that beginning with the 2024 production year, it is canceling the July Cattle report, and discontinuing the Cotton Objective Yield Survey and all County Estimates for Crops and Livestock. “Mississippi would still receive some inventory estimates, but the categories NASS is eliminating are extremely important for the cattle industry in our state,” Hyde-Smith said. \\xa0“I am very concerned that we are going to struggle without this important data. \\xa0Markets will be more uncertain and producers will have less information to make production and risk management decisions.” ### \\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0  * indicates a required field.

Hyde-Smith serves on the Senate Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee and raised the Rural Community Hospital Demonstration Program and other Mississippi healthcare-related issues at a hearing to review the FY2025 HHS budget requests. “Mississippi ranks among the states with the highest rates of hospitals at risk of closing. \\xa0This demonstration program could serve as a means to keeping their rural hospital doors open to serve their communities in need of high-quality healthcare. \\xa0However, CMS has not solicited applications since 2017 despite, as I understand it, there being a handful of open spots in the program,” Hyde-Smith told Becerra. \\xa0“Can you commit to working with me to solicit applications for the program and to find ways to help hospitals keep their doors open in rural areas?” Becerra said the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) demonstration program can be a “lifeline” by using alternative payment models for rural hospitals facing financial constraints with the Medicare Inpatient Prospective Payment System. \\xa0Hospitals in Columbia, Meridian, and Picayune have participated in this program. “It is absolutely essential that we give hospitals that are willing to stay open a chance to survive if the older version, definition of how they get reimbursed isn’t working for them. \\xa0We look forward to working with you because we have got to figure out a way to keep some of these facilities open and operating,” Becerra said. Hyde-Smith also sought insights into how HHS could help improve maternal health in Mississippi, where “OB deserts” make access to prenatal care a challenge. “Mississippi has consistently seen some of the poorest maternal health outcomes in the nation, made worse by high rates of chronic disease and limited access to specialty care for many mothers.\\xa0 We have also led the nation in infant mortality, something we’re not proud of at all, and very concerned about. \\xa0But it’s driven largely by a very high preterm birth rate stemming from lack of prenatal care. \\xa0Access to maternity care in rural areas is a major challenge. \\xa0We are seeing a rapid expansion of ‘OB deserts’ across Mississippi. \\xa0In some areas of my state women are having to drive more than an hour for any kind of obstetric care,” Hyde-Smith said. \\xa0“How can we work with you to improve outcomes for our mothers and babies in Mississippi?” Becerra stressed the need for early access to care for pregnant women, which makes keeping rural healthcare facilities open. “The most important thing is early access and, as you mentioned, sometimes because a state like Mississippi has a lot of rural communities it is tough to have access. \\xa0That’s why it is so important to not allow any existing health facility to go under in rural America because then the access becomes even more difficult,” Becerra said. \\xa0“Telemedicine, telehealth is going to be very important to for communities and families in rural America because it means they can have access without the physical travel.” Hyde-Smith and Becerra both agreed that Congress, working with HHS and CMS, must act to extend long-term authorization for Medicare legislative and regulatory telehealth flexibilities that will expire in December. “Our nation’s healthcare systems and providers need clarity and stability to implement and maintain the operational and clinical practices needed to ensure seamless, quality care for millions of Medicare beneficiaries nationwide. \\xa0I strongly encourage CMS to work alongside Congress by continuing to share relevant telehealth data with Members of Congress and staff as well as continuing to engage with stakeholders through public calls on pertinent telehealth issues,” Hyde-Smith said. Hyde-Smith is an original cosponsor of the comprehensive Creating Opportunities Now for Necessary and Effective Care Technologies (CONNECT) for Health Act (S.2016), which would expand coverage of telehealth services through Medicare, make permanent COVID-19 telehealth flexibilities, improve health outcomes, and make it easier for patients to connect with their doctors. ###  * indicates a required field.

       " '\\nHYDE-SMITH COSPONSORS BILL TO STRIKE DOWN SEC CLIMATE DISCLOSURE RULE SEC Final Rule Makes Agency Climate Change Taskmaster Over Markets, Public Companies WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) on Wednesday cosponsored a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to overturn the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) radical climate disclosure rule that exceeds the agency’s authority and would lead to mountains of burdensome paperwork for companies and higher costs for consumers. Hyde-Smith, who serves on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, is an original cosponsor of the bipartisan S.J.Res.72 to strike the SEC climate disclosure rule, which requires publicly traded companies to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions data. \\xa0It was introduced by Banking Committee Ranking Member Tim Scott (R-S.C.). “We recognize that the Biden administration is in a regulatory frenzy, but the radical SEC climate disclosure rule is so out of bounds that it must be struck down,” Hyde-Smith said. \\xa0“The SEC is a securities regulator with a mandate to protect investors, facilitate capital formation, and maintain markets. \\xa0It has absolutely no statutory authority to address political or social issues, much less serve as a climate change taskmaster.” “The SEC’s final climate disclosure rule threatens economic opportunity across the country, and it must be overturned. \\xa0Over and over again, SEC Chair Gensler has disregarded the real-world impacts of his aggressive regulatory agenda in his dogged pursuit of left-wing political priorities. \\xa0This rule is no exception. \\xa0The SEC’s mission is to regulate our capital markets and ensure all Americans can safely share in their economic success – not to force a partisan climate agenda on American businesses. \\xa0This rule is federal overreach at its worst, and the SEC should stay in its lane,” Scott said. The 886-page final rule, titled “The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors,” requires any public company to include onerous climate-related disclosures in their annual public reports, including direct greenhouse gas emissions and indirect greenhouse gas emissions from energy sources. \\xa0It also requires companies to disclose the potential impacts of nonfinancial risks, like severe weather or other natural disasters. Under Chair Gary Gensler, the SEC has pursued an aggressive regulatory agendas with the agency currently on track to propose and finalize over 60 rules. \\xa0Like the climate disclosure rule, many are being pushed with limited public comment periods and inadequate cost-benefit analyses. Supporters of S.J.Res.72 believe the rule threatens the U.S. capital markets’ position as the global gold standard by overwhelming businesses with compliance costs, litigation, and fines as they are forced to adopt burdensome assessment mechanisms to determine what climate-related information needs to be reported or not. Additional original cosponsors of the measure include U.S. Senators Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), John Kennedy (R-La.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), Katie Britt (R-Ala.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), John Cornyn (R-Texas), John Thune (R-S.D.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), Ted Budd (R-N.C.), and Pete Ricketts (R-Neb.). ### \\n\\xa0  * indicates a required field.

Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack approved the farm-raised catfish purchase using the permanently-authorized “Section 32” program to make emergency purchases of surplus U.S. commodities for distribution to domestic food assistance programs. “Catfish producers in Mississippi and other states continue to be buffeted by any number of challenges, including high input costs, inflation, and unfair global competition. \\xa0However, they’re fighters and keep serving up a wonderful product,” Hyde-Smith said. \\xa0“The continued Section 32 purchases should help them some while also getting more nutritious farm-raised catfish products to those in need.” Hyde-Smith has consistently promoted the use of Section 32 purchases of farm-raised catfish and other products, like shrimp, to support U.S. agricultural producers and to provide additional resources for distribution to food banks and other nonprofit nutrition programs. \\xa0In January, Vilsack approved the purchase of up to $36 million in Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic wild-caught shrimp products under the Section 32 program. In December, Hyde-Smith cosponsored the Ban C-FOOD Act (S.3417), which would ban U.S. imports of seafood and aquaculture products from China. \\xa0It would also sanction companies that import Chinese seafood and place tariffs on countries that facilitate the shipment of the seafood. ### \\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0  * indicates a required field.

       " '\\nHYDE-SMITH, BLUMENTHAL INTRODUCE BILL TO PROVIDE REFUNDS TO NATURAL GAS CONSUMERS FROM PIPELINE OVERCHARGES MPACT Act Would Close Loophole, Allow FERC to Require Natural Gas Pipelines to Pay Rebates WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) joined U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) to introduce legislation to give the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) authority to order interstate natural gas pipelines to pay refunds for overcharging consumers. The Making Pipelines Accountable to Consumers and Taxpayers (MPACT) Act (S.4171) would close a loophole that limits the ability of FERC to benefit consumers after it determines an interstate natural gas pipeline is overcharging and exceeding established return on equity standards. \\xa0Closing the loophole would hold natural gas pipelines to the same standard applied to electricity providers that are required to provide rebates for overcharges. “This legislation is a matter of basic fairness to consumers in Mississippi and elsewhere, whether they use natural gas to cook meals or heat a poultry house. \\xa0Right now, they have no recourse or chance for a refund when an interstate natural gas pipeline makes millions of dollars in overcharges,” said Hyde-Smith, who serves on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. \\xa0“We need this legislation to close this loophole and ensure natural gas pipeline regulations are transparent for the American people.” “We must close a legal loophole that natural gas companies have used routinely and reprehensibly to take advantage of consumers. \\xa0The companies overcharge consumers who are unable to receive full reimbursements under current law. \\xa0This is a matter of simple fairness: if consumers are overcharged for a utility, they should be made whole. \\xa0With the Making Pipelines Accountable to Consumers and Taxpayers Act, we can hold natural gas pipeline operators accountable for stealing money out of consumers’ pockets and ensure that those consumers are paying only the correct, reasonable rate,” said Blumenthal. Under the Natural Gas Act, FERC can order natural gas pipeline companies to lower their rates, but cannot order the pipeline to refund any overcharges to its customers. \\xa0The MPACT Act would remedy this problem by holding natural gas pipeline operators accountable to ratepayers and increase transparency around FERC regulation of natural gas pipelines. Hyde-Smith recently asked three FERC commissioner nominees about their level of support for amending the Natural Gas Act to give the FERC refund authority in cases where natural gas transmission pipelines charge unfair rates to their customers. Some of the organizations endorsing the MPACT Act include the American Public Gas Association (APGA), Industrial Energy Consumers of America, National Gas Supply Association, American Forest and Paper Association, American Public Power Association, Cargill, Inc., Essential Minerals Association, and Process Gas Consumers Group. “I commend Senator Hyde-Smith for introducing the MPACT Act. \\xa0This bill will help ensure fair energy rates for natural gas consumers in Mississippi and across the country. \\xa0Natural gas consumers in the state, including the customers we serve at Corinth Gas and Water, deserve the same protections from excessive interstate gas transmission rates that electric consumers already enjoy. \\xa0Congress should quickly pass Senator Hyde-Smith’s MPACT Act to protect natural gas consumers across America,” Chris Latch of Corinth, chairman of the APGA Board of Directors. “The American Public Gas Association commends Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith and Senator Richard Blumenthal for their effort to reintroduce the Making Pipelines Accountable to Consumers and Taxpayers Act (MPACT). \\xa0If enacted, this bill will help keep energy rates affordable for Americans using natural gas in their homes and businesses. \\xa0The millions of natural gas consumers across the country deserve the same protections afforded to electric consumers when interstate transmission entities charge excessive rates. \\xa0This legislation is critical to continue the efforts of public gas utilities to deliver affordable, reliable, and efficient energy to their customers in 38 states. \\xa0APGA urges Congress to swiftly pass Senator Hyde-Smith’s and Senator Blumenthal’s MPACT Act,” said Dave Schryver, APGA President & CEO.\\xa0 ### \\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\xa0  * indicates a required field.

NASA's decision displays a troubling indifference towards some of our nation's most brilliant minds and years of innovation to advance this mission. It is particularly alarming that these cuts disproportionately target California’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, an institution at the forefront of numerous scientific breakthroughs. NASA’s ill-considered decision flies in the face of Congressional intent and will result in the loss of hundreds of California jobs. It will also deliver a serious blow to our nation’s leadership in space exploration.”Schiff has continuously opposed the shortsighted budget cuts to the Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission. In November 2023, he and Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) spearheaded a bipartisan, bicameral letter from the California delegation, urging NASA Administrator Bill Nelson to reverse the funding reductions. Following NASA's announcement of federal budget cuts, Schiff issued a statement against the forced reduction of Jet Propulsion Laboratory's (JPL) workforce by 530 employees, which constituted eight percent of its total staff, through layoffs. ###\",\n",

We've been demanding for months that we bring up Ukraine funding. Of course, the speaker could have done that months ago. He could have done it, done it separately, like we're doing today. Or it could have brought up the Senate bill. It would have passed overwhelmingly in the House, but nevertheless, we are where we are. “And hopefully this week we'll finally get that aid passed that Ukraine so desperately needs. That we need to send to Israel the humanitarian assistance, as well. As well as aid to Taiwan and our other allies.”On Trump Being in the Defendant’s Chair, Where He Belongs “Well, in terms of, you know, seeing him finally sit in the defendant's chair where I think he belongs, it's been a long time in coming. And it is, you know, I think from the perspective of the justice system, an affirmation that even a former president is not above the law. And ultimately, there is accountability. “But after seeing him successfully delay one proceeding after another after another, literally for years. But then these criminal trials for months and months and months. Finally seeing him face justice in the courtroom, is a long awaited reckoning for the former president. “In terms of whether I would have liked to have seen a different case go forward first. To be candid, yes. I think the most serious and substantial of all the cases is the January 6th federal prosecution. And, you know, there the Justice Department took a long time to get that case investigated to begin with, but nevertheless, the Supreme Court has quite willfully allowed Trump to delay that proceeding by, you know, continuing to sit on its hands when it comes to one of the bogus appeals involving this purported claim of immunity.

Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) spoke to a group of over 100 local business and civic leaders from San Diego visiting Washington, D.C. as part of the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce’s annual delegation to the nation’s capital.During his remarks, Schiff highlighted his priorities for Southern California including tackling environmental challenges such as cross-border pollution from the Tijuana River, protecting and expanding key transportation infrastructure like the LOSSAN Corridor along California’s coastline, and his commitment to securing the federal resources needed to help cities across the state combat the dual housing affordability and homelessness crisis. Schiff also emphasized his commitment to working closely with local leaders, as well as House and Senate colleagues, to ensure that San Diego communities have the additional federal support and resources needed to meet their unique needs. See key excerpts of his remarks and photos below: On Combating the Dual Housing Affordability and Homelessness Crisis [...] Because the solution in San Diego may be different than Los Angeles, which may be different from the Central Valley, which may be different from every other state of the Union. But I think what we can productively do is to help provide the resources, help provide the incentives, help provide some of the metrics. Because I know the great frustration of our constituents is that we are spending money to try to solve this challenge, and people want to know they're willing to do it.They don't want their neighbors to be homeless, but they want to make sure that the money is well spent. And so I think one of the things that the federal government can help to productively do is not only share information about best methods, best approaches, what works in other parts of the state and country, but also help provide some of the tools to measure what is being successful.On Tackling Cross Border Pollution of the Tijuana River [...]And I know [Imperial Beach] Mayor Aguirre has been acutely focused on this, and I want to make sure that the federal government does everything possible to help solve this problem. There's simply no way that any city, along the coast or on the border can handle this challenge. This is an international problem. it requires an international solution.It’s going to require a lot more resources from the federal government. A lot better cooperation with Mexico. And, I certainly want to do everything I can with Senator Butler, with Senator Padilla, with your delegation to fight for those resources to solve this problem ASAP, to get that South Bay National Wastewater Treatment Plant working properly, to make sure that we deal with the pollution south of the border. And that we do whatever cleanup is necessary.On Continuing Key Investments for San Diego Transportation Infrastructure [...] I also want to highlight, as Mike Levin has reinforced to me time and time again, the importance of the LOSSAN Corridor and the incredible volume that that carries, and the need to make sure that we prevent that line from falling into the sea. And the thing of it is, through the infrastructure bill, through the Inflation Reduction Act, and other legislation, there is going to be a lot of money going out over the next several years. The only question is, where is that money going to go? And we want to fight to make sure that money comes to California and the money comes to San Diego, and we use it to address these major infrastructure challenges. \\xa0 ### \\xa0\",\n",
       " \"Washington, D.C.— On Wednesday, Representative Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) spoke at the Armenian Genocide Commemoration on Capitol Hill to mark the nearly 109 years since the Ottoman Empire began their concerted, and systematic effort to destroy the Armenian people. Schiff’s 30th Congressional District, which includes the cities of Burbank and Glendale, is home to the largest Armenian diaspora community in the country. He also serves as Vice Chair of the Congressional Armenian Caucus. In 2019, the U.S. House passed Schiff’s resolution officially recognizing the Armenian Genocide with broad bipartisan support. \\xa0  See key excerpts of his remarks below: On the Facts and Recognition of the Armenian Genocide\\xa0 This month, 109 years ago, Armenians from all walks of life were rounded up and brutally murdered. Writers, artists, business owners. Clergy were tortured and burned alive in churches, infants stolen from their parents’ arms. Over a million men, women, and children. About a million and a half indeed. Entire families wiped out in the most brutal, heartbreaking of ways. All of you here likely to have someone in your family tree who suffered under the tragedy of this genocide.And yet, despite overwhelming and increasing, ever increasing evidence of this methodical mass killing, Turkey has engaged in a long and dangerous campaign to deny the genocide and to silence anyone who seeks to speak truth.Because of the district I represent, I've had the honor to sit with survivors. I've been welcomed into their homes. I've listened to their stories of how their parents and aunts and uncles and grandparents were murdered. How their property and the lives their families built were destroyed. I’ve watched them relive the pain over and over, reopening the wound to keep their family's history alive.And while we are gathered this month to commemorate these atrocities, there was a time when Washington refused to recognize these methodical killings for what they were — genocide. The first of the 20th century.Over many, many years, we've worked tirelessly to convince our colleagues in Congress, presidents of both parties and the American people, the importance of formally recognizing the Armenian Genocide.And I'm so proud that in 2019, I had the honor of carrying the resolution that officially recognized the Armenian Genocide and passed by a near unanimous and bipartisan vote.In 2021, President Biden became the first president in office to set aside decades of shameful silence and recognized the Armenian Genocide. These historic achievements took place because of a resilient and enduring Armenian diaspora and decades of work. It is a testament to thousands of activists, organizations, communities, and faith leaders. A victory for human rights and for the truth itself.On the Duty to Protect Armenians Abroad and to this day, President Aliyev of Azerbaijan continues to echo the genocidal language and actions of a century ago, and with the support of Turkey. They attacked Artsakh in 2020, they blockaded Nagorno Karabakh for nearly ten months starting in December 2022 and then in 2023, the Aliyev regime took control of the people they had systematically starved and ethnically cleansed — Artsakh’s indigenous Armenian population.So, as we mark the 109th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide with pledges of ‘never again’, the democratic and peaceful Armenian people face threats that echo their darkest days.The time for strong statements by the administration alone have long passed. Condemnation must be followed by real consequences. Crimes against humanity cannot be ignored and cannot go unanswered.On the Resiliency of the Armenian People\\xa0 On this solemn anniversary as we pause to remember the innocent victims of the Armenian Genocide, we also reflect on the resilience of those who survived, and the perseverance of their children and grandchildren, who built lives in the United States and around the world, who speak their beautiful Armenian language, and enrich every nation with the Armenian culture and heritage.Despite the horrors the Armenian people have faced – and continue to face – it has not broken their faith, determination, or their will to survive. The Armenian people have overcome the harshest of trials and they remain strong and unbowed. In Southern California, in Yerevan and around the world.And I'm proud to be before you, and to say that I will always stand with the Armenian community. ###\",\n",

       " 'PASSPORT ASSISTANCE Cincinnati, OH – Today, Congressman Greg Landsman (OH-01) announced the opening of his Fiscal Year 2025 federal Community Project Funding process. Each year, members of Congress can submit up to 15 local, community-led projects to the House Appropriations Committee for consideration to receive specialized federal funding through the appropriations bills that Congress passes annually to fund the federal government. The Community Project Funding process allows members of Congress to work closely with community partners – including local and state governmental entities and certain non-profit entities – to identify projects of regional importance and deploy significant federal funding that will benefit the community as a whole. Congressman Landsman will receive Community Project Funding applications and then select 15 projects to submit to the House Appropriations Committee to be considered. While the 15 projects Congressman Landsman submits to the House Appropriations Committee are not guaranteed to receive Community Project Funding, he will work with community partners in a transparent and bipartisan manner to submit projects that have the greatest likelihood of being approved by the House Appropriations Committee for Community Project Funding. During the last Fiscal Year 2024 Community Project Funding process, Congressman Landsman secured more than $15 million for 15 Southwest Ohio projects. Projects eligible for Community Project Funding include, but are not limited to: Congressman Landsman: “The Community Project Funding process is a district game-changer for our community leaders who receive funding to work on important projects for their communities. It’s our job to help them through this process and last year, we brought home $15 million for 15 incredible initiatives.

       " 'Learn More Last week, Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (WA-03) and Rep. John Curtis (UT-03) introduced the bipartisan Water Systems PFAS Liability Protection Act to ensure that water utilities can continue to focus their efforts on maintaining water quality rather than defending themselves when PFAS polluters seek to dilute their liability. “PFAS chemicals have harmful effects on our health and children’s development – and water utilities are on the front line of the treatment and disposal of these substances,” said Rep. Gluesenkamp Perez. “This bipartisan legislation will help ensure policies to hold PFAS polluters accountable aren’t having unintended consequences on water utilities and ratepayers, especially in small and rural communities.” In 2022, the EPA formally announced plans to designate two of the most common PFAS – Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) – as hazardous substances under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). If finalized, this designation could put drinking water utilities at risk of incurring cleanup liability when they take necessary steps to remove and dispose of PFAS deposited into water supplies by upstream polluting industries. In addition, wastewater and stormwater utilities could also be put at risk as they receive PFAS chemicals through the raw influent that arrives at the treatment plan or through municipal stormwater runoff. While EPA has announced an “enforcement discretion” policy that intends to focus on polluters that are responsible for the contamination and have profited from PFAS, such a policy will be insufficient to ensure that drinking water and clean water ratepayers will be permanently protected from CERCLA legal defense costs and cleanup liability for PFAS. “We support this legislation which will take a meaningful step in protecting water utilities, who are passive receivers of PFAS, from financial and legal liabilities associated with decades of use of these chemicals in manufacturing and consumer products,” said John Peterson, Executive Director of the Discovery Clean Water Alliance. “PFAS is becoming the environmental challenge of our time. Water utilities can and will play an important role in reducing its prevalence in our environment, but subjecting them to undue financial burden and liability will only hurt the 150,000 residents who rely on – and pay for – our agency’s sewer services.” “The City of Vancouver provides clean drinking water and wastewater services to nearly 275,000 people in Clark County,” said Vancouver Mayor Anne McEnerny-Ogle. “It’s critical that we continue to invest our resources in identifying the sources and treating for PFAS rather than defending potential legal action for a systematic problem we didn’t create or control.” “At Thurston PUD, we thank Congresswoman Gluesenkamp Perez from Washington’s 3rd Congressional District for her leadership and support of water entities through her introduction of a House companion bill to the Senate-proposed Water Systems PFAS Liability Protection Act, said Julie Parker, Assistant General Manager of Thurston PUD. “This bill will shield the public utility ratepayers from liabilities that should be shouldered by the polluters as the law intended. Utility ratepayers are already footing the bill to pay to treat the contaminated water and dispose of the contaminates, they shouldn’t have to pay a third time for the problem.” “As not-for-profit, community-owned utilities, Washington public utility districts strive to provide safe affordable service to our ratepayers,” said Liz Anderson, Executive Director of the Washington Public Utility Districts Association (WPUDA). We applaud Congresswoman Marie Gluesenkamp Perez for her leadership on legislation that will help ensure polluters, not the public, pay for PFAS cleanup.” “In the West, and particularly in Utah, we understand deeply the value of clean water to our communities, our economy, and our way of life,” said Rep. Curtis. “This bill prevents the burden of industrial irresponsibility to fall on the shoulders of Utah’s families and ratepayers. It’s about ensuring that those who profit from these chemicals bear the cost of their impact, not the Utahns who rely on the integrity of their water supply.” Full text of the legislation is available here.

       " 'Learn More Yesterday, Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (WA-03) and Rep. Pete Stauber’s (MN-08) bipartisan legislation, the Small Business Procurement and Utilization Reform (SPUR) Act, unanimously passed the House Small Business Committee.\\xa0 The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is tasked with ensuring that small businesses are given a fair shot at competing for federal contracting dollars. Although the amount of federal contract dollars awarded to small businesses has reached record highs, the number of small businesses in the industrial base has declined dramatically. Data indicates the federal government is not retaining current small business contractors, and fewer small businesses are choosing to enter the federal market. The SPUR Act would require the SBA to include the number of new small businesses entering the federal contracting market as part of their consideration of each federal agency’s performance meeting small business contracting goals. “Even though more federal contracting dollars are making it to small businesses, fewer small businesses are deciding to take up federal contracts. For our local economies to thrive, it’s important that we level the playing field and ensure more Southwest Washington small businesses can benefit from these opportunities,” said Rep. Gluesenkamp Perez. “As more folks retire from the trades, the middle class will lose out if small businesses can’t clear the regulatory burdens of competing for contracts. I introduced this bipartisan legislation to help ensure our federal government is retaining and bringing in small business contractors – and today’s passage in the House Small Business Committee is another step toward getting this across the finish line.” Rep. Gluesenkamp Perez’s Corrective Action Report Oversight and Accountability Act passed the House Small Business Committee last year to help ensure federal agencies meet their benchmarks for the percentage of contracting dollars reaching women-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned, and small disadvantaged businesses.

       " 'Learn More Today, Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (WA-03) and Rep. Suzanne Bonamici (OR-01) led a bipartisan, bicameral letter to the U.S. Army and Office of Management and Budget urging the allocation of $21.6 million of FY24 construction funding for the South Jetty at the mouth of the Columbia River. Prioritizing completion of the jetty would help protect Southwest Washington and Northwest Oregon ports and businesses that rely on the navigation channel. The Columbia River Basin is the third largest grain export gateway in the world. In 2020, roughly 51 million tons of cargo, valued at $22 billion, moved through the deep draft Lower Columbia River. The jetty system safeguards traffic through the gateway, supporting ports and businesses in Washington, Oregon, and the broader region. Frequent storms have degraded the jetties – and if they are compromised during an intense storm event, sand could accumulate in the channel and shut down commercial navigation at the river system’s entrance. Restoring access would require expensive emergency repairs and dredging. The Mouth of the Columbia River Jetty System Major Rehabilitation Project began in 2014 to address these risks, with the North Jetty and Jetty A having already been completed.\\xa0 A remaining portion of the South Jetty requires completion, so the lawmakers are urging its prioritization through the FY24 work plan process. Without the funding, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers may not be able to complete construction without significant increases to the cost or timeline. “We respectfully request the Fiscal Year 2024 construction funding to complete construction of the Columbia River Jetties Rehabilitation so that our ports and harbors can continue to serve their communities and the nation,” wrote the lawmakers. “As our nation works to stimulate economic development and increase job growth, this project will assist in maintaining the navigation and trade assets that keep critical supply chains and goods moving.” Sens.

Suzan DelBene (WA-01), Cathy McMorris Rodgers (WA-05), Earl Blumenauer (OR-03), Val Hoyle (OR-04), Lori Chavez-DeRemer (OR-05), and Andrea Salinas (OR-06) also signed the letter. “We are extremely grateful for the delegation’s strong support for this critical infrastructure funding to complete the jetty rehabilitation at the mouth of the Columbia River, which will ensure cargo vessels and cruise ships can continue to traverse the Columbia River bar safely,” said Neil Maunu, Executive Director of the Pacific Northwest Waterways Association. “Last year over $27 billion worth of cargo transited in and out of the Columbia River. This river system is the gateway to the world and supports over 51 million tons of commodities and 25,000 cruise passengers a year.

We have a special connection to this particular boot, as we led the research and development, testing, and initial fielding efforts for this upgraded safety boot. These boots are worn by the all-important Aircraft Carrier Flight Deck crews who maintain, arm, launch, and recover aircraft, as well as the sailors across the Navy,”\\xa0said Mark Ferguson, President of the Belleville Shoe Manufacturing Company. The Belleville Shoe Manufacturing Company is the oldest and leading manufacturer of boots for the U.S. Military – beginning with their first combat boot supply order during WWI. Belleville Boot supplies the largest selection of certified boots to the U.S. Military and develops an assortment of styles to meet specialized needs. Representatives Budzinski and Bost successfully included a bipartisan amendment to the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act to require the Department of Defense to examine current military footwear regulations and provide recommendations on improvements to support the footwear needs of our troops. This provision aims to support domestic military-grade boot manufacturing, like that done by Belleville Shoe Manufacturing Company.

Facilities in Champaign and Springfield have been recommended for downsizing despite the region’s dismal on-time-delivery rates.\\xa0 “Postmaster DeJoy has no business reducing mail processing capacity in areas that are already short staffed and struggling to receive mail on time. Today, I introduced bipartisan legislation that will halt these plans in Champaign and Springfield, and in underserviced areas across the country,”said Congresswoman Budzinski.\\xa0“I’m grateful to Congressman Jack Bergman for joining me in this important effort to protect local USPS jobs and push back on a misguided effort that could further impact poor postal delivery rates in our communities.” “Bureaucrats in the U.S. Postal Service seem to have this misperception that they understand the delivery needs of the Upper Peninsula’s rural communities more than the people actually living there. My constituents rely on the Postal Service for the timely delivery of bills, payments, prescriptions, and other necessities, and they deserve a functional mail service, absent of manufactured delays caused by bureaucratic ineptitude. I thank my colleague, Congresswoman Nikki Budzinski, for co-leading this critical bill – the Protect Postal Performance Act – to halt the Postal Service’s ill-conceived consolidation plans in areas where the agency is already underperforming,”\\xa0said Congressman Bergman.\\xa0 Congresswoman Budzinski and Congresswoman Mary Miller (R-IL-15) have sent two letters to Postmaster General Louis DeJoy raising serious concerns about USPS plans to downsize the Champaign and Springfield Processing and Distribution Centers. The plans could mean worse delivery rates and the relocation of dozens of jobs to the Chicago and St. Louis areas. Budzinski also joined a letter with Senator Durbin, Senator Duckworth and other members of the Illinois delegation with concerns about what the USPS plans could mean for mail delivery across the state. Budzinski’s\\xa0Protect Postal Performance Act\\xa0would bar the USPS from considering facility downsizing in regions that aren’t meeting the USPS delivery targets of 90.3% on-time delivery for three to five-day first-class mail and 93% on-time delivery for two-day first-class mail.

       " \"WASHINGTON, D.C. —\\xa0Today,\\xa0U.S. Representatives Nikki Budzinski (IL-13)\\xa0and\\xa0Angie Craig (MN-02)\\xa0held a press conference in front of the U.S. Capitol as they\\xa0led 95 New Democrat Coalition colleagues in a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson calling for immediate bipartisan action to fund the Affordable Connectivity Program. The American Rescue Plan created the Emergency Broadband Benefit, which provides discounted or free broadband for low-income households. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law expanded the program into the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), which provides a discount of up to $30 a month for qualifying low-income households. The ACP currently empowers 23 million households across the country to access affordable broadband. Without additional funding from Congress, the ACP will run out of funding, and millions of households could lose crucial internet access.\\xa0 “When voters sent me to Washington, they tasked me with fighting to bring down the everyday costs that are holding too many working families back. That’s what the Affordable Connectivity Program is all about,”\\xa0said Congresswoman Budzinski.\\xa0“The ACP ensures that lower-income households can afford access to high-speed internet for work, school, health care and more. In 2024, access to the internet isn’t a luxury, it’s a necessity. Since the ACP was launched, more than 17 million households across the country have received support. In the district I serve, more than 75,000 households have subscribed to the Affordable Connectivity Program. And it’s saving families in my district nearly $40 million a year. I held a roundtable in East St. Louis where nearly every household benefits from the ACP. I heard about what this program has meant for students, for families, for workers, for patients. But this is all at risk if the ACP expires at the end of this month. My office has heard from more than 9,000 constituents who would be hurt by a disruption to this program. If Congress allows the ACP to lapse, internet services for millions of Americans could be disrupted. I’m proud to be here today to urge GOP leadership to maintain this critical program for families in my district and across the country.”\\xa0 The letter Budzinski and Craig sent to Speaker Johnson reads in part: “As New Dems, we are committed to fighting to lower everyday costs for Americans; letting the ACP lapse will lead to a direct increase in broadband costs for consumers. We reaffirm our call to House Republicans to deliver for the American people and provide the ACP with the funding it needs without delay.” Full text of the letter can be found here and below: Dear Speaker Johnson, In the nearly three years since the establishment of the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, millions of American households have received aid from the ACP to access affordable broadband and participate in the 21st century economy. Without the monthly benefit the ACP provides, many Americans will lose access to distance learning, telemedicine, the online marketplace, and the numerous benefits that high-speed internet provides in everyday life. We are disappointed that despite the incredible impact on the\\xa023 million households\\xa0that have enrolled across the country, House Republican Leadership has blocked any consideration of the funding it needs to keep running, pushing us towards the program’s extinction. At a time of rising costs, Republican Leadership refuses to support this critical program that saves communities money. If Congress does not provide additional funding, April is the last month the full ACP benefit will be provided, and, in May, households will see changes in their bill. More than three-quarters of ACP-enrolled households could either experience a disruption or\\xa0lose access to the internet entirely. We cannot let this happen. As New Dems, we are committed to fighting to lower everyday costs for Americans; letting the ACP lapse will lead to a direct increase in broadband costs for consumers. We reaffirm our call to House Republicans to deliver for the American people and provide the ACP with the funding it needs without delay. In January 2024, the bipartisan, bicameral Affordable Connectivity Program Extension Act was introduced, and, if adopted, would provide an additional $7 billion for the ACP.\\xa0 This Act has broad support, including over 224 co-sponsors. We stand ready and willing to partner with you and the Republican Conference to keep Americans connected to the internet. ### Submissions are due by October 24th, 11:00 a.m. CT SPRINGFIELD, IL —\\xa0Today,\\xa0Congresswoman Nikki Budzinski\\xa0(IL-13)\\xa0announced the start of the 2024 Congressional App Challenge for middle and high school students in Illinois’ 13th Congressional District.

The\\xa0Year-Round E15 Act\\xa0would ensure that E15 sales can begin this year. The bipartisan legislation is co-led by U.S. Representatives Adrian Smith (NE-03), Brad Finstad (MN-01), Eric Sorensen (IL-17) and Don Bacon (NE-02). “Biofuels bring down fuel costs, reduce our dependence on foreign oil, cut carbon emissions and support critical markets for Illinois’ family farmers,”\\xa0said Congresswoman Budzinski.\\xa0“I was glad to see the Environmental Protection Agency take evidence-based action to allow the permanent sale of E15 in Illinois and across the Midwest, but this long-awaited action doesn’t take effect until 2025. Today, I’m proud to introduce bipartisan legislation with my friend, Congressman Zach Nunn, that will address this gap and allow for the sale of cheaper, cleaner fuel for Heartland consumers this summer.”\\xa0 “Since day one, I’ve been fighting for year-round E15. Unfortunately, this Administration has repeatedly put America’s producers and families behind as they stubbornly opposed E15, which is good for the economy, good for the climate, and good for families,”\\xa0said Congressman Nunn.\\xa0“This bill wouldn’t be necessary if the Administration had just done the right thing to begin with, but this is a critical step to provide certainty for farmers, producers, and families who will benefit from less expensive fuel.”\\xa0 In February, the Environmental Protection Agency finalized a rule in February that allows eight midwestern states to sell E15 year-round beginning in April of 2025. The rule applies to Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin. Budzinski released a statement praising the rule and calling for action to allow E15 sales for the 2024 summer driving season and secure permanent E15 sales under the law by passing legislation like the\\xa0Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act.

Owens pressed Columbia President Minouche Shafik on the university’s response to antisemitic incidents on campus. The experience of Jewish students at @Columbia reminds me of my own experiences with hatred, denigration, and bigotry in the 1960s deep south.

Owens asked President Shafik if university policy would be different if the students being attacked based on their identity were Black rather than Jewish, pointing out the double standard that exists at Columbia regarding anti-Jewish hate. “Would Black students be forced to attend the class of a tenured Columbia professor who, while discussing the massacre of Black men, women, and children – if Black girls were raped and Black men lynched – would speak in glowing terms of the event as ‘stunning, awesome, and astonishing,’” asked Rep. Owens. President Shafik responded by saying such a situation would “absolutely not” be tolerated on Columbia’s campus. Yet, Professor Joseph Massad, a 20-year tenured faculty member who described the October 7th attack on Israel as “stunning, awesome, and astonishing,” is still teaching Middle East studies classes at Columbia. “What truly speaks volumes regarding the moral compass of Columbia is that this rabid anti-Semite is still on your payroll today,” continued Rep. Owens. Rep. Owens finished his testimony by questioning how international students who disrupt campus learning, attend hateful demonstrations, and threaten their fellow students are allowed to graduate with a degree. .@RepBurgessOwens: \"How does this work?\" International students: -pay @Columbia $90,000 a year-skip classes to demonstrate-bully Americans-burn American flags-stop traffic-shout \"Death to America\"And somehow still get a degree? pic.twitter.com/HZ54KwJrBu Click here or above to watch Click here to watch the full hearing. ### WASHINGTON — Congressman Burgess Owens (UT-04) was selected as a finalist for the Congressional Management Foundation (CMF) Democracy Award for Workplace Environment, an annual award recognizing achievement and performance in congressional offices.\\xa0 “From the football field to the People’s House, I have always recognized the power of teamwork,” said Rep.

       " 'WASHINGTON – Congressman Burgess Owens (UT-04) joined House Committee on Homeland Security Chairman Mark Green (TN-07) to introduce the Verifying that All Illegal Aliens Have Legitimate Documents (VALID) Act, to prohibit illegal immigrants from boarding commercial flights into the U.S. with only immigration-issued documents — not the proper state or federal identification required of all Americans. Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) is leading companion legislation in the Senate.\\xa0 “Allowing illegal immigrants to bypass TSA and board commercial flights without a valid form of identification, while American citizens face strict airport security standards, is an outrageous double standard,” said Rep. Owens. “President Biden must put the safety and security of the American people above his open border agenda. The VALID Act closes this loophole, restores common sense, and shuts down the government’s ability to facilitate the travel of illegal immigrants across state lines at taxpayers’ expense.” “Allowing illegal immigrants to abuse commercial airline travel is unacceptable. While Americans must show proper identification to board their flights, illegal immigrants are not required to do so. Instead, the Biden administration is recklessly allowing migrants to use the CBP One app or even their Border Patrol arrest documents as identification. This puts Americans at risk. Illegal immigrants should have to comply with the same laws as American citizens, especially when it comes to valid identification. Refusing to enforce these laws poses severe national security risks,” said Chairman Green.\\xa0 “Every American needs to show ID to enter our country. So why do we make it simpler for illegal immigrants to come in than for our own people? As our nation grapples with an unprecedented invasion at our southern border, the VALID Act resolves to close the loopholes that have allowed 200,000 illegal immigrants into the country unchecked. The Biden administration’s policies have blatantly facilitated this crisis, encouraging illegal immigration and compromising our nation’s security,” said Senator Lee.\\xa0 “Shortly after 9/11 the U.S. Congress, through the REAL ID Act, recognized the importance of establishing certain security standards for identification documents to fly on commercial aircraft,” said Chad Wolf, former acting Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and Executive Director of the America First Policy Institute. “Each presidential administration since 9/11 has worked diligently to bring more security to our skies. Unfortunately, the Biden administration’s policy of allowing illegal aliens to use documents with unverifiable and unvetted information to board commercial aircraft defies common sense and congressional will and makes it easier for illegal aliens to travel than U.S. citizens and legal immigrants. The administration’s unlawful use of the CBP One app to mass parole inadmissible aliens into American communities raises both legal and public safety concerns. The VALID Act is an important step in reining in these abuses and ensuring the safety of the American people.” Original cosponsors of the legislation are Reps.

       " 'WASHINGTON, D.C. — Last week, Rep. Michael Cloud (R-TX) supported a letter calling on President Biden to lift his ban on Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) exports, an issue critical to the South Texas energy sector, as part of deliberations over how Congress should deal with the fallout of the Francis Scott Key Bridge accident.\\xa0\\xa0 In January of this year, President Biden’s White House issued an indefinite ban on the issuance of LNG exports to non-Free Trade agreement countries — and announced no timeline for the end of the ban while the administration reviews “climate change” impacts. The ban has had tremendously negative impacts, not only on South Texas, but on the whole U.S. energy industry, with detrimental effects on job creation and economic opportunity in communities who need it. Furthermore, the lack of a clear timeline from the White House has created significant uncertainty for employers and energy providers, making a bad situation worse. In the wake of the recent Francis Scott Key Bridge tragedy, the conservative House Freedom Caucus has been evaluating ways Congress could assist in rebuilding the bridge while lessening the burden on taxpayers and minimizing the negative fallout of having a major port under construction. One of the proposed solutions, included in a letter sent from the Freedom Caucus to House leadership, proposed that the House require Biden to lift his LNG export ban before Congress appropriates funds for the bridge repairs. The Freedom Caucus letter states that “the Biden Administration’s pause on approvals of liquified natural gas export terminals — which, like the Baltimore harbor closure, has severe implications for foreign trade – must be lifted before Congress considers appropriating any funding for the bridge reconstruction.” Rep. Cloud released the following statement on the letter and his advocacy for Biden to lift his LNG ban: “Everyday President Biden is waging an economic war on our own country by hamstringing the wealth of resources we have at our disposal. This is having untold negative impacts on American workers, businesses, and energy providers — all in pursuit of the left’s futile climate change agenda, where even in a best-case scenario, the average American would receive minimal benefit at a tremendously high cost. The President’s ban on LNG exports was a bad decision with painful consequences – impacting my district and the whole country’s energy sector — and while we can’t afford this kind of self-inflicted damage on a given day, we especially can’t afford it with inflation still rising, the border in ruin, and a major harbor in shambles after a tragic accident. Biden needs to change course. That’s why my Freedom Caucus colleagues and I are pressuring the President on this issue, and why the President should lift his LNG export ban immediately. We should be looking for ways to relieve American taxpayers of their burden — not worsening it with a partisan political agenda from the left. Mr. President, it’s time to unlock the American energy industry and let them do their jobs.” To read the full text of the letter, click HERE. ### Today, Rep.

Cloud has joined his conservative colleagues in the House Freedom Caucus in pressing House Leadership not to use the emergency situation Israel as a means of jamming through more unrelated aid on Ukraine, particularly without action on serious southern border security first. Rep. Cloud released the following statement: “My heart is heavy for the ongoing turmoil in the Middle East and I want to reiterate my prayers for peace. Israel has the right to defend itself and its people, and even though varying degrees of conflict in the Middle East have covered generations, since Hamas’ brutal and unprovoked attack on October 7, Israel has been in a unique danger coming from all sides. Sadly, this reached a boiling point on Saturday when Iran launched a direct attack using missiles and drones — especially unprecedented after years of waging war on the Israeli people through proxies. This cannot stand. Unfortunately, President Biden has continued to show a disturbing lack of leadership on this issue — not only choosing to isolate Israel with blame at a time when they are under attack, but also choosing to leverage the war in Israel as a means of spending more taxpayer funds in Ukraine. This would be unacceptable. As House conservatives have said, the Senate and President Biden should immediately take up and support the Israel aid package already passed by the House, with offsets, showing support for our ally at a critical juncture with no more burden to the taxpayer. Don’t play Ukrainian politics with Israel aid.”\\xa0 To see the latest Freedom Caucus statement referenced earlier, click HERE. ### Today, Rep.

       " 'WASHINGTON, D.C. — On Friday, Rep. Cloud voted NO on H.Res. 1160 — a rule to allow the House of Representatives to advance aid packages on Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan, but with no serious effort to provide border security. While Cloud joined 54 of his conservative colleagues in voting NO, ultimately, the rule passed 316-94. The rule passed with more Democrat support than that of Republicans — an extremely rare occurrence and a shocking deviation from usual procedure. 165 Democrats voted YES, while only 151 Republicans voted YES. This week, House Republican leadership announced their intention to pursue three bills — H.R. 8034, H.R. 8035, H.R. 8036, and H.R. 8038 — to provide aid to Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan, as well as something called a “sidecar” provision to implement a ban on TikTok, among other minor provisions. Conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus have been pushing Republican leadership to include serious border security measures within the combined rule, with the reason being that our government should put a priority on protecting our own southern border before sending money overseas. Additionally, because of the combined rule, if the House passed border security within the same rule, the Senate would be forced to combine both foreign aid and border security in order to advance the bill. Unfortunately, leadership chose to bifurcate the border security issue from the foreign aid package — meaning they separated the border bill into a separate vote, ensuring the border security measures would eventually die in the Senate. Now, the Senate can pass foreign aid without having to even consider the southern border. This amounts to what conservatives have criticized as “failure theatre,” only voting on things for political cover or messaging rather than in a serious effort to make law. There are also a number of grave concerns with the individual aid packages. For example, while the aid to Ukraine is structured as a “loan,” the bill gives the President extremely broad discretion to cancel 50% the debt after the November 2024 election, rendering it extremely unlikely that American taxpayers will ever see this money again. Furthermore, while Rep. Cloud has long supported military aid to our ally Israel, the bill providing Israel aid also includes $9 billion in aid to Gaza. There is overwhelming evidence that Hamas has stolen the vast majority of aid intended for innocent people in Gaza, and the bill contains little to no oversight mechanisms, meaning American taxpayers are essentially funding terrorists. This is completely unacceptable. Rep. Cloud introduced an amendment to give Israel coordination control over aid going into Gaza, as they have previously conducted much better oversight to ensure the aid goes to actual civilians, but House leadership rejected the amendment. Rep. Cloud released the following statement: “The uniparty is hard at work in Congress. My heart is heavy for our country, as I feel as though I’ve written the same thing over and over recently with the conduct of our government, but it is a sad day in America — and a stark reminder that the problems in Washington go well beyond one political party. Once again, Congress has failed to understand and work according to what should be our first priority: protecting our own country. Even as our own borders and our own people are suffering, House leadership just made it easier to send billions overseas without using valuable leverage we have to implement real border security. While I certainly understand the importance of helping innocent friends and allies in need, Congress should not be shipping billions overseas at the expense of the homeland. It’s wrong. My conservative colleagues and I are evaluating next steps, but we will not be giving up. While trust in leadership may be deeply broken, I will continue to fight for serious border security and for substantive change to Washington.” House leadership intends to vote on the aid packages on Saturday, April 20, after the rule advanced today. ### Today, Rep.

       " 'WASHINGTON, DC – Today, the United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a long-awaited report: “Public Health Preparedness: Mpox Response Highlights Need for HHS to Address Recurring Challenges.” Beginning in July 2022, Congressman Ritchie Torres (NY-15) was the leading Congressional voice urging the GAO and HHS to do such a report, and he is grateful to the GAO for tackling this crucial issue head-on. As a Co-Chair of the Congressional Equality Caucus and the sole LGBTQI+ member of Congress from New York City — which was the epicenter of the Mpox outbreak — Rep. Torres has fought tirelessly to ensure that his community’s vital health needs are not forgotten. In GAO’s report, they concluded that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) lacks a cohesive, department-wide strategy for learning from past public health emergencies to improve future responses. The GAO’s findings reveal a significant gap in the coordination among HHS’s component agencies, resulting in missed opportunities for leveraging collective experiences and insights. This fragmentation impedes the effectiveness of public health emergency preparedness and response. In addition, the report found that HHS’s ability to apply lessons and learn following an emergency response was further limited due to not always having all relevant stakeholders involved when identifying challenges and associated solutions. The report also identified shortcomings in risk communication efforts by HHS and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), particularly in reaching and clearly communicating risks to the most vulnerable populations. This includes the inadequacy of Mpox communication efforts in terms of inclusivity and the limitations faced by non-English speakers due to insufficient translation of critical public health information. In response to the report’s conclusions, Rep. Torres is today introducing the Coordinated Agency Response Enhancement (CARE Act). This legislation, if enacted, would: Require the Secretary of HHS to develop and implement a coordinated, department-wide after-action program that encourages collaboration between HHS’s component agencies, including integrating the existing public health emergency after-action programs of these component agencies. The after-action program should include relevant external stakeholders involved in each public health emergency response — such as other federal agencies, jurisdictions, and nongovernmental partners — when identifying challenges and associated solutions. Require the Secretary of HHS to direct the CDC and other relevant HHS agencies to develop and implement a comprehensive risk communication strategy that is inclusive and culturally sensitive. This strategy would be designed to clearly identify at-risk populations during public health emergencies and provide targeted, understandable, and accessible information to prevent the spread of diseases. The act would also require the translation of public health communications into multiple languages. Implementing a department-wide after-action program, coupled with a commitment to inclusive and culturally sensitive risk communication, would significantly strengthen the nation’s capacity to manage public health emergencies. By learning from past experiences and ensuring clear, accessible coordination, HHS can better protect all communities, particularly the most at-risk populations, against future health crises. This bill represents a critical step forward in our ongoing efforts to enhance public health emergency preparedness and response capabilities across the United States. On the report’s findings and the CARE Act, Rep. Torres released the following statement: “As I have long suspected, today’s report makes abundantly clear that our government’s disease response apparatus is not properly equipped to successfully coordinate and improve its systems and processes over time. In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and Mpox outbreak, it’s time we radically change our federal approach to public health. Marginalized and at-risk communities cannot afford to bear the brunt of another public health emergency, desperately waiting for the government to get its act together. I am urging my partners at HHS and across the Biden administration to read through the full report and implement a set of clear policies in response to mitigate future crises, and this is exactly what I intend to pursue with the CARE Act.” Additional relevant materials:CBS News: Rep.

       " 'Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) introduced the Carried Interest Fairness Act of 2024 to eliminate a tax loophole that allows wealthy investment managers to evade paying their fair share of taxes. The current carried interest loophole allows these money managers to pay the lower 23.8 percent capital gains tax rate on income received as compensation, rather than the ordinary income tax rates of up to 40.8 percent that they would pay for the same amount of wage income. According to the Treasury proposal, closing this loophole will raise $6.5 billion in revenue over 10 years. “Currently, there is a loophole in our tax code that allows hedge fund managers to pay less in taxes for wage income than ordinary West Virginian and American workers, and these managers have taken advantage of it for far too long. Our commonsense legislation would close this loophole to ensure the wealthiest Americans are paying their fair share and contributing to our national economic growth rather than just their personal pockets. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this practical legislation that treats all workers fairly and moves to create a more equitable tax code,” said Senator Manchin. “Hardworking Wisconsin families should not be paying more in taxes than the wealthiest Americans. But right now, our tax code has loopholes that allow super wealthy hedge fund managers to avoid paying their fair share,” said Senator Baldwin. “By closing the carried interest loophole, we’ll make our tax code fairer for working families, cut the deficit, and ensure that those at the top of the food chain aren’t exploiting the system to further enrich themselves.” “This loophole is yet another way wealthy special interests have rigged the system to work for them, at the expense of everyone else. Hedge funds and private equity firms shouldn’t pay less taxes than working people in Ohio. This bill is a commonsense solution to promote fairness and make Wall Street pay its fair share,” said Senator Brown. The Carried Interest Fairness Act of 2024 is supported by AFL-CIO, American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees, American Federation of Teachers (AFSCME), Communications Workers of America (CWA), Main Street Alliance, Patriotic Millionaires, Public Citizen, Small Business Majority, United for Respect, NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice, and National Women’s Law Center, Economic Policy Institute, 20/20 Vision. “The carried interest loophole is one of the clearest examples of how the wealthiest rig the tax code in their favor,” said David Kass, Executive Director Americans for Tax Fairness. “Rich fund managers should not be allowed to pay a lower federal tax rate than registered nurses or powerline workers. Ending this loophole is a common sense win for tax fairness.” In addition to Senators Manchin, Baldwin, and Brown, this legislation is also cosponsored by Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Ed Markey (D-MA), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Bernie Sanders (I-VT),\\xa0Jack Reed (D-RI), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Peter Welch (D-VT), and Cory Booker (D-NJ).

       " \"Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), member of the Senate Appropriations Committee,\\xa0questioned Xavier Becerra, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, on fully implementing Jessie’s Law and better classifying rural Appalachia for federal healthcare resources. On fully implementing Jessie’s Law:  “I was pleased to see the Department finalize the rule to implement the Jessica Grubbs’ Legacy Act that we worked on for so long. The law reduces barriers for treating persons with substance use disorder by aligning the privacy laws governing the records with HIPAA, the law which governs all other health privacy records. This has allowed for medical professionals to access vital information they need to properly coordinate care. In 2018, Congress passed a separate law in honor of Jessie called Jesse's Law. This requires HHS to develop best practices for hospitals and doctors to display a patient's history of substance use disorder when the patient provides that information,” Senator Manchin said in part. “Now that the Department has finalized the rule on Confidentiality of Substance Use Disorder Patient Records, it’s time to fully implement Jesse's Law. When will you be releasing the best practices for displaying substance use disorder and patient records?” On better classifying rural Appalachia for federal healthcare resources: “The Health Resources and Services Administration administers grants and programs that are critical to rural health centers, clinics and hospitals. Your budget requests a $2 billion increase to this agency to carry out these programs. However, many areas of West Virginia remain unable to access these resources. West Virginia is the only state that lies completely within the Appalachian Mountain region. A recent United States Department of Agricultural Economic Research Services report recognized this unique topography – we’re the most rugged, mountainous state in the country – finding that almost 81% of West Virginians live in a rugged area. That's compared to just 11.7% of the entire United States population. The Fiscal Year 2024 bill included language for HRSA to review this report to update their rural definition to better capture the uniqueness of Appalachia. Can you provide an update on this review and a timeline for when we're going to see results so West Virginians can finally access the resources they need?” Senator Manchin questioned.

Granholm about the President’s budget request for the DOE\\xa0for Fiscal Year 2025. During the hearing, Chairman Manchin discussed the historic American energy investments resulting from the\\xa0Inflation Reduction Act\\xa0(IRA) and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law,\\xa0his concerns with Administration actions that deviate from those laws,\\xa0the national labs’ work on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). “As Chairman of this Committee and Senator for one of America’s energy powerhouses, it has been incredible to witness how transformative the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and\\xa0Inflation Reduction Act\\xa0have been so far. We are more energy independent today than we ever have been, and we’re producing more energy cleaner than ever,”\\xa0said Chairman Manchin during his opening remarks.\\xa0“These bills created a lot of opportunity, which is why I am so frustrated about the numerous ways the Administration is trying to reinvent them to fit their political agenda and picking winners and losers.”\\xa0 During the hearing, Chairman Manchin discussed the implementation of the IRA’s 45V Hydrogen Production Tax Credit. Chairman Manchin\\xa0announced\\xa0last year that West Virginia would be home to a new Hydrogen Hub to help kickstart a domestic hydrogen industry. “The immediate response to the Administration’s proposed guidance on the 45V tax credit is clear: if implemented, it would jeopardize the viability of the industry before it even has a chance to get off the ground…\\xa0The industry response includes a letter from all seven of DOE’s hydrogen hubs, who wrote in February of this year that their projects will ‘no longer be economically’ viable unless Treasury’s guidance is ‘significantly revised.’ Do you think we should heed the warning of DOE’s own\\xa0seven\\xa0hubs and do you have any insight into what might be changed?”\\xa0asked Chairman Manchin.\\xa0 “We want these\\xa0hubs to succeed and\\xa0we, meaning\\xa0the Administration, the Treasury Department, put out specific questions that they were inviting responses for as they finalized the rule. We’ve gotten over 30,000 responses and they are working through those responses,”\\xa0replied Secretary Granholm. Chairman Manchin asked Secretary Granholm about the national labs’ work on AI. “America must accelerate our efforts to compete and defend against our adversaries like China on AI, and the Department of Energy has the central role in that mission. The Department and its national labs have the computing resources, we have those in our national labs. We’re not going to get further ahead if we go back and try to reinvent the wheel again.\\xa0[With your jurisdiction] over our National Labs,\\xa0I think you might have some thoughts about this,”\\xa0said Chairman Manchin.\\xa0 “Our national labs are in the driver’s seat – we have the tools. We have the largest exascale computers in the world, we are obviously using AI in all of the labs,\"\\xa0said Secretary Granholm.\\xa0 “We’re very much concerned about the amount of money we’re going to have that’s going to be divided up when those resources could get better results if we stay with what we already have,”\\xa0said Chairman Manchin. Chairman Manchin also questioned Secretary Granholm about the SPR. From 2021 through 2023, 290 million barrels were sold from the SPR, bringing the SPR to its lowest level in 40 years. A majority of those sales were the Administration’s 180-million-barrel emergency release in 2022. Congress also ordered over 80 million barrels sold since 2021. “While I’m glad to see DOE has begun refilling the reserve, I’m told there is only enough funding to bring us back to around 400 million [barrels]. Do you think 400 million [barrels] is a large enough reserve? Has DOE done an analysis about the right size for the reserve? If it’s not enough, what do we need to do to fix that?”\\xa0asked Chairman Manchin. “We are buying back, and we want to buy back at a rate that is good for the taxpayers,”\\xa0said Secretary Granholm. “You’re not buying right now, the $85-$90 [per barrel] range?”\\xa0asked Chairman Manchin. “In the past few months, we had because it was below $80 [per barrel] but in the latest round it came in above, so we cancelled that one. But we still have a strategy of continuing to do this at a value for the taxpayers noting that we sold for $95 per barrel and we want to buy back at a rate that saves them,”\\xa0replied Secretary Granholm.

This rule will play an essential role in safeguarding miners from cancers, silicosis and black lung disease, especially in Appalachia where black lung cases have been rapidly increasing in recent years. For generations, our brave coal miners have risked their lives to power our nation to greatness, and we will continue working together in the Senate to advance commonsense rules like this one to protect the health and welfare of these heroes,” the Senators said.  “We're grateful for the Agency's initiative in implementing a rule to tackle the increasing incidence of silica-related lung diseases among both coal and metal non-metal miners. The resurgence of these diseases, particularly affecting younger miners in their 30s and 40s, underscores the urgency of this issue. This measure is vital for safeguarding miners' well-being not only in the short term but throughout their careers. The UMWA’s focus now shifts to ensuring mining companies are held accountable,” said United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) International President Cecil E. Roberts. Last June, the Senators released a statement applauding the proposed rule and calling for its swift implementation. A fact sheet on the rule is available here.\",\n",
       " 'Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) joined his bipartisan colleagues in introducing the Antisemitism Awareness Act. This legislation would help combat antisemitic sentiment and action on college campuses, which has been rising across the U.S. for years and spiked in the wake of Hamas’ terrorist attack on October 7, 2023. It would require the U.S. Department of Education to consider the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism when enforcing federal anti-discrimination laws. “The horrifying attack we saw on Israel in October has led to an appalling amount of antisemitic activity on college campuses,” said Senator Manchin. “I’m proud to introduce the bipartisan Antisemitism Awareness Act to not only help combat this disturbing trend, but also prioritize the safety and wellbeing of Jewish students across our country. I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this important legislation.” The Antisemitism Awareness Act would make permanent the Department of Education’s usage of the IHRA’s definition of antisemitism, which is a vital tool to clarify and identify the various manifestations of antisemitism. Since 2018, the Department of Education has used the IHRA definition when investigating violations of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. According to recent reporting by the Anti-Defamation League, antisemitic incidents in the U.S. more than doubled in 2023 with 8,873 cases of assault, harassment and vandalism across the country. In addition to Senator Manchin, the legislation is cosponsored by Senators Bob Casey (D-PA), Tim Scott (R-SC), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), James Lankford (R-OK), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Rick Scott (R-FL), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), John Boozman (R-AR), Christopher Coons (D-DE), Susan Collins (R-ME), Kyrsten Sinema (I-AZ), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Kristen Gillibrand (D-NY), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), Josh Hawley (R-MO), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Katie Britt (R-AL), John Fetterman (D-PA), Pete Ricketts (R-NE), Ben Cardin (D-MD), John Barrasso (R-WY), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), John Cornyn (R-TX), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV).',\n",

On holding Mexico accountable for drug trafficking across the U.S. Southern Border: “Certainly, the Southern Border is the greatest threat we face right now. It has been more detrimental to our security than anything we’ve seen in modern history,” Senator Manchin said in part. “We haven’t taken enough action on Mexico with the tools we have. Opioids coming into the country have devastated my home state. Is there anything that can be done to threaten their participation as a member of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement? That would be of great economic concern in their country and I think they would respond.” On the ability of President Biden to declare a National Emergency to shut down the Southern Border: “Does the President have the ability as an executive order to declare a National Emergency and shut it down?” Senator Manchin questioned. “I’ve been encouraging him in every way I possibly can to use the rules and tools we have and executive powers to shut it down until we get a handle on it…The President had no problem whatsoever declaring an executive order to relieve student debt. And that has been challenged in court but he does it anyway.” On the reauthorization of FISA: “This week, the Senate's going to take up a two-year extension to FISA. Some groups have raised concerns that the reauthorization the House passed would expand the scope of who could be targeted under Section 702 by changing the definition of electronic communication service providers. I, for one, do not have those concerns because we have expanded upon how we communicate in different ways and we should be looking at everything to protect our country.

Dear Postmaster General DeJoy: We are writing in strong opposition to the consolidation and review announcements recently made throughout the country by the United States Postal Service (USPS). A common theme of these announcements is the so-called “modernization” of Processing and Distribution Centers (P&DCs) into Local Processing Centers (LPCs). Taken together, these proposals dismantle parts of the Postal Service’s robust network that helps distribute mail across the country and places outgoing sorting into more distant facilities. The result of this change is that mail will need to travel farther from its origin to its sorting, creating inefficiencies in the system, especially for local mail. Additionally, some of the proposed improvements described as modernization include deferred maintenance for these facilities, which the Postal Service should have already completed. We hear frequently from our constituents about deteriorating mail delivery. Customers rely on the Postal Service for a variety of important services, including their medication, newspapers, and financial documents. Sending mail farther for sorting is unlikely to improve service. The Postal Service has stated that mail will continue to meet service delivery standards. However, according to the Postal Service, revisions made in 2021 to these delivery standards “will increase time-in-transit standards by 1 or 2 days for certain mail that is traveling longer distances.” For affected communities, the mail will certainly be traveling longer distances, leading to longer processing times. The announced network changes align with the Postal Service’s Delivering for America (DFA) plan. However, a recent review by the USPS Office of Inspector General of the implementation of the new Regional Processing and Distribution Center (RP&DC) in Richmond, Virginia, raises alarms. That facility was the first to be converted to an RP&DC as a result of the DFA plan. The Inspector General’s review noted that challenges associated with changes to the facility “contributed to a decrease in service performance for the Richmond region that continued four months after launch.” This report should have given pause and caused a review of the plan. However, less than two weeks after the release of this report, the Postal Service announced additional facility conversions, including the downgrades of the Eastern Maine P&DC and the Charleston, West Virginia P&DC – that state’s only remaining full-service facility – to LPCs. Additionally, despite community opposition, the Postal Service is moving forward with downgrades to facilities in Arkansas, Delaware, Missouri, New Hampshire, Oregon, and Tennessee, while being on track to make the same decision in Illinois, Michigan, Mississippi, Nevada, and Vermont, and pushing ongoing changes to the Atlanta RP&DC. These consolidation proposals never have had any discernible support from local communities. On the contrary, we have heard strong opposition to these efforts from USPS customers, community leaders, local businesses, and postal employees. Rather than marching forward with these plans and offering short and vague statements dismissing concerns, the Postal Service should be communicating why the organization believes these changes are beneficial and what the specific impact of the changes will be to mail service. We understand the Postmaster General stresses the need to restore the Postal Service to solid financial footing, but we disagree with the proposed changes to postal facilities, particularly given the increased transportation and labor costs associated with implementation of the RP&DC, as described by the IG report. We are skeptical that the DFA plan will successfully accomplish its described goals. It is undisputed that the Postal Service faces a number of challenges in its efforts to provide universal mail delivery service, including workforce challenges, long distances, declining mail volume, and competition in certain markets. However, the proposed network redesign creates a new set of challenges for the Postal Service and is shattering customer confidence in the USPS. The Postal Service provides an essential service upon which our constituents rely. The robust nature of the Postal Service’s current network is its strength, not its weakness. To ensure that our constituents continue to receive reliable service, we urge you to reconsider these consolidation announcements.',\n",

However, my Republican friends in Congress also bear the responsibility of making it worse by refusing to even vote for one of the strongest, most sensible border security bills in decades that was endorsed by the 18,000 Border Patrol agents fighting every day to secure our country. “Impeachment is among the most solemn powers Congress possesses. The purpose is not to punish wrongdoing, but to preserve our constitutional government by removing treacherous and unfit officials from positions of public trust. Neither of the articles of impeachment against Secretary Mayorkas alleged any corruption, bribery, or any other crime. Instead, the House of Representatives sought to impeach a Cabinet official over a policy disagreement with the President. “I voted to dismiss the articles of impeachment against Secretary Mayorkas to avoid setting the dangerous precedent that this solemn process could be weaponized again against future Administration officials to score cheap political points. I believe in American democracy and the American people’s ability to settle our policy disputes at the ballot box in November.

The rule would place unnecessary burdens on publicly traded companies by requiring them to provide investors with an estimate of both their direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions. “The SEC’s new rule on emissions disclosures completely contradicts its long-standing commitment to protect investors and promote a fair and efficient U.S. financial market,” said Senator Manchin. “This deliberate targeting of fossil fuel companies not only threatens our economic security, but also sends a strong signal of opposition to the all-of-the-above energy policy that is absolutely critical to our country and our allies right now. Every American investor can already choose to invest their money in climate-forward companies if they wish to – the infusion of politics in a free and fair market is entirely overreaching, fiscally irresponsible, and simply un-American.” Senator Manchin, the only Democrat to cosponsor the resolution, was joined by Senators Tim Scott (R-SC), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Thom Tillis (R-NC), John Kennedy (R-LA), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), J.D.

       " \"Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, D-Ore., Rep. Sara Jacobs, D-Calif., with 42 members, urged hospitals and health care providers to take action to protect sensitive medical records from partisan fishing expeditions carried out by extremist state attorneys generals by using the tools already available to them under federal law, in letters sent today. “These thinly veiled political assaults come at the expense of vulnerable patients. We are concerned that hospitals are feebly complying with AGs’ requests, betraying their obligation to protect patient privacy,” the members wrote, in a letter to the American Hospital Association, the Federation of American Hospitals, America's Essential Hospitals, the National Rural Health Association, and the Children's Hospital Association. Wyden and other members called on these associations to encourage their members to adopt best practices for patient privacy and support their members in resisting abusive demands for patient medical records. The letter comes in response to a report by the Senate Finance Committee’s majority staff about trans healthcare record requests by attorneys general in Tennessee, Indiana, Missouri, and Texas, and how medical providers responded to those requests. While some providers protected their patients by fighting against overbroad requests for detailed medical records, Vanderbilt University Medical Center handed over tens of thousands of pages of patient information, including intimate information and photographs, to the Tennessee Attorney General (AG).\\xa0 The investigation by the Tennessee attorney general into young adults seeking transgender health care triggered a massive increase in individuals seeking emergency mental health care, including support for experiencing suicidal thoughts. Rainbow Youth Project (RYP), an organization that provides emergency behavioral health care, responded to 376 acute mental health crises from LGBTQ+ youth in the area in a single day, more than 100 times the project’s average call volume.\\xa0 “The devastating impact of patient medical record disclosures in Tennessee — which led to patients experiencing suicidal ideation — has demonstrated the unimaginable and extensive harms that occur when hospitals fail to protect patient privacy,” the members wrote.\\xa0 The letter is cosigned by Senators Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., Mazie Hirono, D-Hawai’i, Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., Alex Padilla, D-Calif., Brian Schatz, D-Hawai’i, Ed Markey, D-Mass., and Peter Welch, D-Vt.

However, if requestors fail to satisfy that three-part test, providers can challenge the validity of these requests. Further, providers can always seek to narrow requests by exercising the legal recourse available to them.\\xa0 Wyden, Jacobs, and the other members asked the hospital associations to help their members take the following steps to protect the privacy of patients’ medical records:\\xa0 The letter asks the hospital associations to consider these best practices, establish additional best practices, and schedule a roundtable this year, with relevant stakeholders, where a toolkit on best practices will be disseminated.

       " 'Watch a video of Wyden deliver his remarks here As prepared for delivery Washington, D.C. — I rise in strong opposition to this FISA bill.\\xa0\\xa0 There is a key question here: who should be forced to help their government spy?\\xa0\\xa0 The legislation coming from the House gives the government unchecked authority to order millions of Americans to spy on behalf of the government.\\xa0 Under current law - section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act - the government can order the telephone companies and email and internet service providers to hand over communications.\\xa0 This bill expands that power dramatically. It says that the government can force cooperation from, quote, “any other service provider who has access to equipment that is being or may be used to transmit or store wire or electronic communications.” Now, if you have access to any communications, the government can force you to help it spy.\\xa0That means anyone with access to a server, a wire, a cable box, a wifi router, a phone, or a computer. Think about the millions of Americans who work in buildings and offices in which communications are stored or pass through.\\xa0 After all, every office building in America has data cables running through it.\\xa0These people are not just the engineers who install, maintain and repair our communications infrastructure; there are countless others who could be forced to help the government spy, including those who clean offices and guard buildings. If this provision is enacted, the government could deputize any one of these people against their will, and force them to become an agent for Big Brother.\\xa0 For example, by forcing an employee to insert a USB thumb drive into a server at an office they clean or guard at night. This could all happen without any oversight. The FISA Court won’t know about it. Congress won’t know about it. The Americans who are handed these directives will be forbidden from talking about it. And unless they can afford high priced lawyers with security clearances who know their way around the FISA Court, they will have no recourse at all. Supporters of this provision will say that this doesn’t change the fact that Section 702 only targets foreigners overseas. But if the government thinks that those targets are communicating with people in the United States they could go right to the source – the wifi, the phone lines, the servers that transmit or store those communications. If the government has an interest in those foreign targets, well, the Americans whose communications get collected are out of luck. Supporters of this provision will also say this was necessary because of a FISA Court opinion. I disagree. That opinion did not gut Section 702. This provision is not necessary. And there certainly is no justification for this vast expansion of surveillance authorities. Supporters also claim that the provision has a narrow purpose and that the government does not intend to start tapping into every American’s phone line or wifi. But that’s not how this provision is written. And I would say respectfully that anyone who votes to give the government vast powers under the premise that intelligence agencies won’t actually use it is being shockingly naive.\\xa0\\xa0 Supporters also point to a handful of exceptions that were tacked on to this provision, excluding things like hotels and coffee shops. Anyone who reads the text will see that these provisions clearly aren’t designed to work. Even the coffee shop exception is meaningless because it wouldn’t cover a company that maintains the coffee shop’s wifi. And the fact that there are a couple random exceptions further proves my point: this provision will force a huge range of companies and individuals to spy for the government.\\xa0\\xa0 Supporters have even argued that this bill had to be broadly written because what the government actually wants to do is secret. I don’t accept that Alice-in-Wonderland logic. First, the American people deserve to know when the government can spy on them and when it can’t. If you can’t clearly explain to American voters why you need new powers, then you should not have them. Second, it doesn’t matter what the government might be secretly intending to do with these authorities at the moment. This is a statutory authority that will be in place for years, during which time the government may very well decide to dramatically expand its surveillance activities.\\xa0\\xa0 Some of my colleagues say that they are not worried about President Biden abusing these authorities. In that case, how about President Trump? Imagine these authorities in his hands. If you are worried about having a president who lives to target vulnerable Americans, to pit Americans against each other, to find every conceivable way to punish his perceived enemies, you should find this bill terrifying.\\xa0 This bill expands 702 authorities in other ways.\\xa0For example, it includes a dramatic increase in the use of Section 702 in vetting travelers to the United States. It requires that the Attorney General enable searches on all travelers – tens of millions of people who come to the United States annually. This is a dragnet search of every work colleague, neighbor and classmate who is here on a visa, every grandparent visiting for a wedding or a funeral.\\xa0\\xa0 These are just some of the ways in which this bill expands warrantless surveillance authorities. On top of all that, it fails to reform Section 702 in any meaningful way. I’ll start with warrantless searches of Americans’ communications swept up in Section 702 collection. Those searches have gone after American protesters, political campaign donors, even people who simply reported crimes to the FBI. The abuses have been extensive and well documented.\\xa0 Supporters of this bill will argue that the FBI has cleaned up its act. But, even after the FBI made changes to its internal policies, abuses continued, including searches for a U.S. Senator, a state senator, and a state judge who had complained to the FBI about police abuses. But the broader concern is that without checks and balances, there is nothing preventing a rapid increase of abuses after reauthorization. Supporters of this bill will say that it codifies the FBI’s internal changes. But without checks and balances, what good are those changes? Reformers have put forward extremely modest, common sense solutions. Warrants would not be required for all U.S. person searches.\\xa0Reform proposals allow the government to see whether an American was communicating with foreign targets. A warrant is required only when the government wants to read the content of those communications, a situation that arises less than two percent of the time. Our provision also allows for emergency searches and has exceptions for imminent threats of death or injury, pre-existing law enforcement or FISA warrants, consent, and access to malware in cyberattacks. This modest reform should be debated and voted on in the Senate. There are other common sense reforms to Section 702 that are not in this bill. For example, it does not protect Americans against reverse targeting and it does not prohibit the collection of domestic communications. Finally, this bill should have been an opportunity to pass meaningful protections for Americans’ privacy from abusive government subpoenas, targeted at the most vulnerable groups in our society, including women, religious and racial minorities, and LGBTQ+ people. Fifteen states have now banned abortion, with more on the way. When states enforce bans on reproductive health access, they’ll use everything from location data generated by connected cars and the smartphone in the patient’s pocket, to the google search that the patient used to find the reproductive health facility or online telemedicine service. All of that can be obtained without a court order. Congress needs to safeguard Americans’ privacy, not give the President NEW surveillance powers. Congress has the time to draft comprehensive privacy and cybersecurity legislation, including 702 reauthorization. Chair Durbin’s SAFE Act and my Government Surveillance Reform Act are both bipartisan reform bills that are ready for consideration.\\xa0\\xa0 I want to close with this: This chamber has time to do the right thing. Senators do not need to rubber stamp a disastrous surveillance bill, just because we are once again considering it at the last possible moment.\\xa0 The FISA Court recently renewed the court’s annual 702 certifications, which authorize surveillance until April 2025. This means there is no need for Congress to rush.\\xa0\\xa0 If members insist on extending the authorization, I am even prepared to accept a short-term extension of the existing 702 authority by unanimous consent.\\xa0 But under no circumstances should the United States Senate be cowed by those who say senators have no choice except to sign off on whatever piece of paper the executive branch requests. Reformers have stood ready and willing since last fall to have this debate. And yet, the status quo crowd wouldn’t pick up the phone until the last possible moment, to ensure this body wouldn’t have time for anything but a last-second vote on this dangerous bill. The only way this body will have a real debate about reforming government surveillance is by rejecting the House bill and standing up for the Senate’s independence and Americans’ Constitutional rights. Ben Franklin got it right: Americans don’t have to sacrifice liberty for security - The Congress has a duty to deliver laws that give us both. ###',\n",

While the initial water allocation announced this year was less than expected, this immediate funding we secured and pushed the Biden administration to make available will go toward helping the region meet the challenges ahead. “We are encouraged by the progress that Tribes and farmers in the basin have made in recent months, including the historic agreement between the Klamath Tribes, Yurok Tribe, Karuk Tribe, and Klamath Water Users Association, as well as the infusion of $72 million?in new federal funding from the\\xa0Bipartisan Infrastructure Law\\xa0for the basin’s recovery. “Driven by the momentum of the cooperation paired with the robust investments that we secured, we are encouraged by the new ways folks are coming together to modernize agricultural operations, restore ecosystems and productive farms, and save the C’waam and Koptu fish\\xa0from extinction. All these collective efforts are certainly building toward more comprehensive solutions where everyone in the Klamath Basin moves forward together toward a more resilient future.” ###',\n",
       " 'Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley this week urged federal health officials to award a planning grant up to $2.5 million to Oregon that would strengthen school-based health services financed by Medicaid in the state. The senators’ letter to the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services comes in support of the Oregon Health Authority’s (OHA) grant application. “This planning grant would help OHA and the Oregon Department of Education (ODE) to prepare Oregon’s schools to provide a holistic approach to students’ medical and behavioral health needs provided in school settings, expand the availability of reimbursement for all medically-necessary Medicaid-covered services provided in the school-based setting, support school districts and local education agencies (LEAs) via technical assistance and training, and support community engagement,” Wyden and Merkley wrote CMS Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure. “These are exactly the types of activities we envisioned these grants could support.” CMS in 2014 began letting states seek Medicaid reimbursement for health services for all students enrolled in Medicaid. Oregon is one of a limited number of states that’s taken the initiative to expand its use of Medicaid beyond services listed on individualized education programs and individualized family service plans to support a broad range of health services in schools. “We are excited about this opportunity for Oregon, and we are confident OHA will use this grant funding to effectively fill current gaps in their provision of Medicaid-funded school-based health services,” Wyden and Merkley wrote.

       " 'Rule would reclassify broadband as a telecommunications service and reinstate net neutrality protections Washington (April 18, 2024) - Senators Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), along with Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel, Senator Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), and Representative Anna Eshoo (CA-16), today at a press conference praised the upcoming FCC rule reclassifying broadband as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Communications Act and reinstating net neutrality protections. The FCC officially released the rule on April 4, and the Commission will vote on the final rule at its open meeting on April 25.\\xa0 Net neutrality is essential for all Americans to be able to freely communicate, seek jobs and telehealth care, run businesses, and more. The Trump administration had previously repealed the net neutrality rule, stripping away the protections of a free and open internet and eliminating the Commission’s rightful authority over broadband.\\xa0\\xa0 “Over six years after the Trump FCC foolishly repealed the net neutrality rule, the FCC is on the verge of reinstating these critical protections and regaining the authority to oversee the most critical communication tool of our day: broadband,”\\xa0said Senators Wyden and Markey. “This rulemaking is an overdue recognition that broadband – like water or electricity – is essential, and the FCC’s authority should reflect that. We commend Chairwoman Rosenworcel and the Commission staff for their hard work, diligence, and expertise, and we will continue to work with them to adopt and defend strong net neutrality protections.”\\xa0 “Americans should be able to use the internet without fear and without foreign adversaries posing legitimate threats to them on U.S. soil. We need to protect the growing innovation economy by making sure that we have rules that say you can’t throttle, you can’t slow down, and you can’t charge exorbitant fees just to have preferential treatment,”\\xa0said Senator Cantwell.\\xa0“I applaud the Chair for their work and look forward to working with her. I thank my colleagues, Senator Markey, who has been such a leader on this, and my dear friend, Anna Eshoo, for her unbelievable leadership in the House.”\\xa0 “I’ve advocated for a free and open internet since I came to Congress. Lack of an open internet has real life consequences. In 2018, while Santa Clara County firefighters were fighting one of the largest wildfires in California’s history, Verizon throttled their data speeds, slowing them down to one 200th of their normal speed, severely hindering their ability to communicate and putting people’s lives at risk. The FCC’s action to restore net neutrality is imperative for public safety, consumer protection, and American innovation,”\\xa0said Congresswoman Eshoo. “There are a lot of things in this country that divide us, but net neutrality is not one of them. Survey after survey showed that 80 percent of the public support the FCC’s national net neutrality rules and opposed their repeal.\\xa0 Bringing back the FCC’s authority over broadband and putting back net neutrality rules is popular, and it has been court-tested and court-approved. It is good for consumers who count on broadband like never before, and it is important for public safety and national security. When the FCC votes next week, we have an opportunity to get this right. Because in a modern digital economy, it is time to have broadband oversight, national net neutrality rules and policies that ensure the internet is fast, open, and fair,”\\xa0said Chairwoman Rosenworcel.\\xa0 In 2006, Senators Wyden and Markey introduced the first net neutrality bills in the House of Representatives and Senate, respectively. On April 2, Senators Wyden and Markey, along with Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), sent a letter to the FCC urging it to finalize a strong net neutrality rule. In September 2023, Senators Wyden and Markey led 25 of their Senate colleagues calling on the FCC to reclassify broadband as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Communications Act and restore net neutrality protections. Senators Wyden and Markey previously introduced\\xa0the\\xa0Net Neutrality and Broadband Justice Act, which would accurately classify broadband as a telecommunications service under Title II.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 ###',\n",

The robust nature of the Postal Service’s current network is its strength, not its weakness. To ensure that our constituents continue to receive reliable service, we urge you to reconsider these consolidation announcements,”\\xa0the Members concluded. Joining\\xa0Merkley, Wyden, Collins, and Manchin on the letter are Senators Angus King (I-ME), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Peter Welch (D-VT), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), and U.S. Representatives Jared Golden (D-ME), Steve Womack (R-AR), Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE), Barry Loudermilk (R-GA), Eric Sorensen (D-IL), Nikki Budzinski (D-IL), Jack Bergman (R-MI), Mark Alford (R-MO), Emanuel Cleaver (D-MO), Mike Ezell (R-MS), and Chris Pappas (D-NH).\\xa0 To read the full letter,\\xa0click?here. Today’s letter is the latest action from Merkley and Wyden in opposition of USPS downgrades of processing and distribution facilities in Oregon, where mail processing at the Eugene and Medford facilities has begun transferring to a facility in Portland, distances of around 110 and 270 miles away, respectively. These changes are especially producing mail delays in the Medford service area.\\xa0 Merkley led a\\xa0bipartisan letter\\xa0with\\xa0members of the Oregon and Georgia congressional delegations to the leaders on the Subcommittees on Appropriations in the Senate and House that oversee the budget for the USPS, calling to block funds for the Postal Service’s planned downgrades.\\xa0\\xa0 In February, Merkley and Wyden joined U.S. Representatives Suzanne Bonamici and Earl Blumenauer\\xa0in a letter\\xa0to Postmaster\\xa0DeJoy?asking USPS leaders to hold public hearings about its plan to consolidate mail sorting in Oregon—specifically flagging the Postal Service’s plan to transfer all sorting and distribution activities in the city to one hub in Beaverton. In their letter, lawmakers called on the USPS to engage in robust dialogue with letter carriers before moving forward with the consolidation plan involving the Portland region. Specifically, they request that USPS convene at least one listening session in every requested location that is open to all affected employees, including in Medford and Eugene. And just last month, Merkley and Wyden joined their Senate colleagues\\xa0in\\xa0another letter\\xa0to\\xa0Postmaster DeJoy, urging him to stop any changes to USPS service standards that would result in job losses and further degrade mail delivery performance, especially in rural areas, which have longer distances where mail must travel and have greater potential risk for delayed service. ###',\n",
       " 'Washington, D.C. — U.S. Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley this week announced that 30 Oregon counties will receive more than $47.7 million in federal payments under the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act (SRS) for schools and road maintenance, youth job training, wildfire prevention, watershed restoration and habitat conservation. These funds are allocated from the U.S. Forest Service, with more expected from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) soon. “The Secure Rural Schools Act has helped rural communities in Oregon and across the nation to be even better places to live and work,” said Wyden, who co-authored the original SRS law in 2000 and secured three additional years of SRS funding in the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. “This direct investment in Oregon counties will help create opportunities for young Oregonians, generate jobs and economic growth, and promote public safety. These are the types of federal investments I fought for more than two decades ago when SRS originally passed, and that I will keep battling to support rural communities throughout the state.“ “Secure Rural Schools payments are critical for our rural communities here in Oregon and across America?because these?investments provide essential support for?our schools, key?infrastructure projects,?public safety, and?wildfire mitigation efforts,”?Merkley said. “These USFS investments in rural Oregon counties with federal forest lands will help secure the resources they need to?stay safe and strong, and I’ll keep fighting to uphold the federal government’s promise to?continue this vital program.”?  The $47.7 million for SRS nationwide provides critical funding for schools, roads, and other municipal services to more than 700 U.S. counties. A portion of U.S. Forest Service funds generated through multi-use activities, such as grazing, timber production, and special use permits supports rural counties with federal forestland to improve the health of forested communities, and can include improving schools and roads, preventing wildfire, stream and watershed restoration, improvement of fish and wildlife habitat, and opportunities for youth training and employment.\\xa0 The county-by-county breakdown for the $47.7 million from the Forest Service in Oregon is as follows: USFS Payments TOTALS\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 $47,782,384.36',\n",
       " 'Watch a video of Wyden deliver his remarks here As prepared for delivery I rise today to describe what happened at the end of the House debate on Section 702 and the sweeping new surveillance authorities that were slipped into the bill by the chair of the House Intelligence Committee.\\xa0 Then I’m going to respond to all of the arguments that were given to justify these expanded authorities in this provision and why they don’t hold water. The chair of the House Intelligence Committee called his amendment merely “technical” – which, as I will explain, it is not – and it passed the House with almost no debate.\\xa0 And now, members of the Senate are being told the same thing.\\xa0 “Nothing to see here,” “it’s technical,” “it’s all classified so stop asking questions.” But I ask my colleagues to read the plain language of the provision.\\xa0 If they do, they will see for themselves that this is actually an incredibly dangerous expansion of warrantless surveillance authorities. Under this provision, there would be practically no limits to who can be forced into spying for the government.\\xa0 Any company that installs, maintains, or repairs wifi or other communications systems in any American business, home, or church can be dragged into this.\\xa0 So can any other company that provides a service that gives its employees access to any communications “equipment,” including a server, a wire, a cable box, a wifi router, a phone or a computer. There are so many examples.\\xa0 Every office building in America has data cables running through it.\\xa0 Tens of thousands of commercial establishments offer wifi to their customers.\\xa0 Under this provision, landlords, the companies that maintain the cables and wifi, and any number of companies whose employees have access to any of that equipment can all be forced to cooperate with the government’s surveillance.\\xa0 Now there have been some pretty desperate and misleading efforts to defend this provision.\\xa0 So I will address each of the arguments I’ve heard in support of this dangerous expansion of surveillance authorities. First, supporters of this provision just wave away the actual language of this provision, insisting that none of these terrible things will happen.\\xa0 But no one has even tried to explain why the plain language of this provision wouldn’t authorize the government to force a huge number of ordinary Americans and American companies to spy for the government. Second, the administration says it’s going after a narrower set of companies, but they can’t talk about it because it’s all secret.\\xa0 That’s not how laws, especially surveillance authorities, should be written.\\xa0 I’m a member of the Intelligence Committee and am familiar with the classified issues. \\xa0The sky is not falling.\\xa0 If the government really has a narrower intent, Congress can take the time to consider whether legislation is needed to actually address it.\\xa0 But jamming through a last minute provision that dramatically expands surveillance authorities in a way that could affect almost any American\\xa0 is the height of irresponsibility.\\xa0 And anyone who thinks that the government won’t eventually use its FISA authorities to the greatest extent possible has been asleep for the last twenty years. Third, supporters of this provision point to the exceptions.\\xa0 But the handful of narrow exceptions only proves my point – if you’re not on that short list, you can be forced to spy for the government. And the exceptions themselves are clearly designed so as not to constrain these vast new authorities in any meaningful way.\\xa0 They are not even designed to work!\\xa0 For example, the exceptions do not include commercial landlords or any company that installs, maintains, or repairs wifi or communications cables.\\xa0 So even if the government can’t force a coffee shop to comply, it can force its landlord, or the company that maintains the coffee shop’s wifi to comply.\\xa0 Fourth, supporters of this provision have said, over and over again, that Section 702 only targets foreigners overseas.\\xa0 But that is a red herring.\\xa0 This provision does not change the targeting rules, but it dramatically changes who can be forced to help the government.\\xa0 And you don’t have to change the targeting rules to threaten Americans’ privacy.\\xa0 If the government thinks that its foreign targets are communicating with people in the United States they could go right to the source – the wifi, the phone lines, the servers that transmit or store those communications.\\xa0 That’s a stunning expansion of the government’s ability to collect Americans’ communications, without any changes to the targeting authority.\\xa0 That brings me to a letter sent yesterday by the Department of Justice, which the Chairman of the Intelligence Committee placed in the record. \\xa0 I urge my colleagues to read it carefully.\\xa0 It goes on and on about how the bill doesn’t change the fact that only foreigners overseas can be “targeted.” The surest sign that you’re losing an argument is when you try to change the subject.\\xa0 And that’s what supporters of this provision and the Department of Justice are doing. The DOJ letter does not deny that the provision authorizes the government to force a broad set of Americans and American companies to assist with warrantless surveillance under Section 702.\\xa0 In fact, DOJ basically concedes this fact by promising that it will only apply the new authorities to certain companies on a secret list.\\xa0 ‘Don’t worry,’ DOJ says, ‘we won’t ever use these sweeping authorities you are handing to us.’\\xa0 That commitment is worth exactly nothing.\\xa0 It is not even binding on this administration.\\xa0 And it certainly isn’t binding on the next administration.\\xa0 These FISA authorities, like all FISA authorities, will eventually be used to their maximum extent.\\xa0 And – you can bet on it – the same members of Congress who are touting this supposed act of restraint from the administration will be the first ones to demand that the government do more with these authorities. To repeat the obvious, secret promises are not law. And giving the government vast new power on the premise that intelligence agencies will never actually use it is simply naive. One other point about the DOJ letter.\\xa0 DOJ has promised to tell Congress what is going on only every six months.\\xa0 Not only is that woefully inadequate, it would be a violation of the government’s statutory obligation to keep Congress fully and currently informed of intelligence activities.\\xa0 If they only updated Congress every six months they would be thumbing their nose at congressional oversight. This provision is fundamentally damaging to democracy. Americans should not be forced to spy for the government without a warrant.\\xa0 Ordinary businesses, big and small, should not be made extensions of government surveillance in ways that put at risk their relationships with their customers. Americans should not have to worry about whether the companies that service their workplaces, the establishments they frequent, or even their homes are secretly spying for the government. What has happened here is truly breathtaking.\\xa0 Until just a week ago, we were all debating reforms of Section 702.\\xa0 We may disagree on what reforms are necessary, but we were at least all talking about the abuses of Section 702 and how to fix them.\\xa0 Now, suddenly, the Senate is being asked to dramatically expand 702 authorities in ways that are almost guaranteed to result in extensive abuses.\\xa0 It is genuinely shocking that, with no public justification, no hearings, no mark-ups, and a single week to even think about it, the U.S. Senate has been asked to give the government sweeping new authorities that could fundamentally change the relationship between Americans and their government. If the Senate passes this legislation today, senators will regret it. And when the eventual wave of abuses is exposed, no one will be able to claim they didn’t see it coming.\\xa0 I urge my colleagues to support the Wyden-Lummis amendment striking this dangerous provision. ###',\n",
       " 'Bipartisan Amendment Strips Provision of House Bill that Requires Anyone who can Access a Server, Cable Box, Wifi Router, Phone or Laptop to Assist in Warrantless 702 Surveillance\\xa0 Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., today introduced an amendment to reverse a major expansion of warrantless surveillance under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that was included in the House-passed bill.\\xa0 The Wyden-Lummis amendment is cosponsored by Sen. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawai’i, and Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo. The provision was added to the bill by House Intelligence Committee leaders with little discussion or debate last week. Supporters of the provision have said the reason for its inclusion is classified. But the amendment says, with only a few exceptions, anyone “who has access to equipment that is being or may be used to transmit or store wire or electronic communications,” will be forced to help the government conduct surveillance.\\xa0 “Thousands and thousands of Americans could be forced into spying for the government by this new bill and with no warrant or direct court oversight whatsoever,” said Wyden, the longest-serving member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. “Forcing ordinary Americans and small businesses to conduct secret, warrantless spying is what authoritarian countries do, not democracies. It would be a terrible dereliction of duty if the Senate meekly accepted the largest expansion of warrantless surveillance since the Patriot Act without so much as an up or down vote.” “The 4th amendment is crystal clear— if the government wants to spy on the American people, it needs to get a warrant,” said Lummis. “Our freedoms and right to privacy play a major role in what distinguishes us from oppressive regimes like the Chinese Communist Party, yet sweeping authorities included in FISA allow the government to force companies to hand over Americans’ private data without a warrant, eroding our privacy. Americans shouldn’t have to worry about the government spying on them in their homes, workplaces or favorite business establishments, which is why Senator Wyden and I are working to close this dangerous loophole and preserve the freedoms afforded to us by the U.S. Constitution.” The amendment text is available here. ###',\n",

Below is a transcript of their remarks:\\xa0 WHIP CLARK:\\xa0Thank you, Mr. Leader. Thank you for putting this moment in the historical context that it deserves. We are here in a make-or-break moment for Ukraine, but also for the standing of the United States. Are we an ally who will come to the defense of another sovereign democracy? Are we going to stand up at this moment and say that we stand together with Ukraine and against the aggression of Putin? And we know that forces across Russia, but also across the aisle here in the House of Representatives, that want to see Putin be successful, that have been holding up this vital national security funding for months and moving the ball as they do it— moving the goalposts.\\xa0So today's the day, and we stand ready as House Democrats to vote for our national security, to vote to stand with our allies across the world and send a message that we stand behind our word, we stand with our allies and we stand firmly for democracy.\\xa0That is how we are going to continue to evaluate this package and that is how we will vote on this package when it comes before the House.\\xa0 LEADER JEFFRIES: For months, America's national security interests have been put on hold, undermined by a group of extreme pro-Putin Republicans, who are determined to stop us from standing with our allies across the world and, in particular, the Ukrainian people, who have fought bravely and valiantly in defense of principles like democracy, freedom and truth. The time has come for the House of Representatives to act, and act decisively in America's national security interests. This is a Churchill or Chamberlain moment. We can either confront Russian aggression in defense of democracy, or we can allow pro-Putin extreme MAGA Republicans to appease. As events have shown in modern world history, appeasement of aggression gets you nowhere. When this was tried at the beginning of the events that precipitated World War II, it led to nothing for more than 100 million people losing their lives or being seriously injured as a result of the events of the Second World War. We cannot repeat our past mistakes. We have to make sure that we stand with our democratic allies in Ukraine, in Israel and in the Indo-Pacific and surge humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians who are in harm's way in Gaza through no fault of their own and civilians who are in war zones all across the world. That's our intention, to get that done over the next few days.\\xa0  CHAIRMAN AGUILAR:\\xa0Thank you Whip Clark and Leader Jeffries. America must maintain its role as the leader of the free world. House Democrats, for months, have been asking to vote on this national security supplemental to get aid to Israel, to Ukraine, humanitarian assistance and Indo-Pacific priorities. It is so important that we support those efforts. Speaker Johnson has to tune out the extremism on his side and give us an opportunity to vote to reach our national security imperatives.\\xa0  # # # Permalink: https://katherineclark.house.gov/2024/4/whip-clark-we-are-here-in-a-make-or-break-moment-for-ukraine\",\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senators Alex Padilla and Laphonza Butler (both D-Calif.) and Representative Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.-25) announced bicameral legislation to create the Chuckwalla National Monument and expand Joshua Tree National Park. The lawmakers also urged President Biden to use his authority under the\\xa0Antiquities Act of 1906\\xa0to designate the monument. Padilla and Ruiz also attended a press conference this morning to push for the establishment and expansion of national monuments in California, including the Chuckwalla National Monument. This bill would establish a new Chuckwalla National Monument in eastern Imperial and Riverside counties to protect approximately 627,855 acres of California’s vast desert landscape. It would also expand Joshua Tree National Park by approximately 17,915 acres of previously designated public lands, as recommended by the National Park Service. “Establishing the Chuckwalla National Monument across California’s vast desert landscape would help us fight the climate crisis, protect critical wildlife corridors, preserve sacred tribal sites, and improve equitable access to nature for our local communities,” said Senator Padilla. “Our proposal reflects the input of tribal leaders who have fought for years to protect these sacred landscapes, and from our partners in the energy industry who worked with us to carefully craft the Monument’s boundaries to ensure we can meet our shared clean energy goals. I look forward to working alongside federal officials, tribes, veterans, and local businesses to secure these protections as soon as possible.” “Honoring Indigenous lands goes hand in hand with our broader conservation efforts, and establishing the Chuckwalla National Monument is so important for the region,” said Senator Butler. “I’m proud to work with the tribal communities and advocates on this legislation to protect their sacred spaces while strengthening public access to nature. I urge President Biden to designate this monument.” “I am honored to introduce the Chuckwalla National Monument Establishment and Joshua Tree National Park Expansion Act of 2024, alongside California U.S. Senators Alex Padilla and Laphonza Butler. I am particularly proud of the collaboration and leadership from a robust coalition, including local tribal leaders, conservationist groups, members of the renewable energy industry, utility companies, community organizations, and youth leaders. They have built the necessary momentum and agreements to ensure this project’s success,” said Dr. Ruiz. “The Chuckwalla National Monument is good for the environment, the economy, and the public’s health. It aims to protect pristine wildlife habitats, endangered plants and animals, and sacred sites of significant spiritual importance to local tribes, crucial for their cultural preservation. Additionally, it will enhance tourism and economic opportunities in our region and provide a new venue for constituents to hike, bike, and enjoy the breathtaking landscapes and natural beauty of our desert. This monument will play an important role in addressing California’s and our nation’s climate change goals while promoting the growth of renewable energy. I am thrilled that we have reached this milestone together and call on President Biden to use the Antiquities Act to expedite the creation of the monument.” “This bill protects a remarkable natural area in our state with important cultural sites and sensitive ecosystems,” said California Natural Resources Secretary Wade Crowfoot. “Designating this area as a National Monument will protect these important lands while boosting outdoor access for communities across the region. I’m proud to support tribal leaders and community-based organizations who driving this effort, and thank Senator Padilla and Congressman Ruiz for championing this important proposal.” The lands within the proposed national monument include the homelands of the Iviatim, Nüwü, Pipa Aha Macav, Kwatsáan, and Maara’yam peoples (Cahuilla, Chemehuevi, Mojave, Quechan, and Serrano nations). Designating the Chuckwalla National Monument would help to protect important spiritual and cultural values tied to the land such as multi-use trail systems established by Indigenous peoples, sacred sites and objects, traditional cultural places, geoglyphs, petroglyphs, pictographs, and native plants and wildlife. “For thousands of years, the Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians have called the lands in the proposed Chuckwalla National Monument home,” said Chairman Thomas Tortez Jr. of the Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians. “The area contains thousands of cultural places and objects of vital importance to the history and identity of the Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians. We strongly support the designation of the Chuckwalla National Monument and thank Senator Alex Padilla and Representative Raul Ruiz for championing this effort.” “The Cahuilla Band of Indians is in strong support of the creation of the Chuckwalla National Monument,” said Erica Schenk, Chairwoman of the Cahuilla Band of Indians. “The area includes village sites, camps, quarries, food processing sites, power places, trails, glyphs, and story and song locations, all of which are evidence of the Cahuilla people’s and other tribes’ close and spiritual relationship to these desert lands.” “These lands encompass our origins, history, songs, religious ceremonies, ancient sites, trails, petroglyphs, artifacts, and intaglios that are spread throughout our traditional territories,” said Jordan D. Joaquin, President of the Fort Yuma Quechan Indian Tribe. “Our footsteps are etched into the landscape since the beginning of time and we continue to persist in modern times, still providing stewardship over these lands. We are wholeheartedly in support of the proposed Chuckwalla National Monument.” The protection of these public lands would help ensure more equitable access to nature for eastern Coachella Valley communities and surrounding areas. The vast desert landscape included in the monument proposal is already cherished for outdoor recreation activities like hiking and rock climbing and is home to habitats critical for the survival of the Chuckwalla lizard and the endangered desert tortoise. Some popular trails and places of interest that would be protected as part of the monument include Painted Canyon and Box Canyon in the Mecca Hills area, Corn Springs campground, and the Bradshaw Trail.\\xa0 The proposed monument is also critical to California’s efforts to fight climate change and conserve biodiversity. Given the size of the monument, it would contribute significantly to state and federal commitments to protect at least 30 percent of public lands and coastal waters by 2030. Protecting these public lands in the desert helps provide a buffer for present-day military installations from development that may interfere with military operations.\\xa0 The proposed Chuckwalla National Monument upholds and supports the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan (DRECP), which identified areas suitable for renewable energy development as well as lands that should be safeguarded for their biological, cultural, recreation, and other values. The proposed monument does not conflict with the development of renewable energy and, in fact, the monument boundaries were specifically drawn to avoid areas identified in the DRECP as suitable for development. The DRECP also identified many of the lands in the proposed monument as being important to conserve for their biological values. Permanently protecting these lands will help to fulfill the DRECP’s goal of balanced development and conservation. “This legislation is a testament to the reality that conservation and renewable energy progress go hand in hand,” said Raisa Lee, Sr. Director of Development, Clearway Energy Group. “We are grateful to Senator Padilla, Senator Butler, and Representative Ruiz for their tireless and collaborative work to protect biological and cultural areas while advancing our county’s clean energy goals. We join lawmakers in urging President Biden to designate this monument.” “Achieving California’s decarbonization goals by 2045 requires rapidly expanding the energy grid to connect solar, wind and other renewables. The Chuckwalla National Monument will protect environmental resources and tribal lands while creating an energy corridor for the electric power lines essential for the state’s clean energy future,” said Pedro J. Pizarro, President and CEO, Edison International. “The solar and storage industry commends Senator Padilla and Representative Ruiz for their efforts to ensure we balance our clean energy, conservation, and environmental justice goals in the Chuckwalla National Monument proposal,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, President and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).\\xa0“SEIA worked closely with these groups to reach an agreement that will\\xa0help\\xa0achieve our nation’s clean energy goals on public lands and make sure we preserve areas of biological and cultural significance. Today’s legislation is an important step toward this vision.” “The Large-scale Solar Association, representing solar energy developers who produce clean energy in the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan area in California, appreciates the valuable assistance of Senator Padilla and Representative Ruiz in incorporating into their bills the agreements that all the stakeholders reached in working on the Chuckwalla National Monument proposal. Today’s legislation and map address our concerns about potential conflicts between a national monument and adjacent solar development focus areas and needed transmission pathways.\\xa0The agreement will help ensure that the State’s plan for 100% renewable energy is successful, that Congressional and Administration goals for renewable energy on public lands are met, and that land with biological and cultural resource value is conserved. Thanks again to Senator Padilla and Representative Ruiz for their support,” said Shannon Eddy, Executive Director of the Large-scale Solar Association. “This compromise achieves conservation interests while enabling the buildout of solar generation and clean power transmission necessary to achieve California’s renewable energy goals. We greatly appreciate Sen. Padilla, Sen. Butler and Rep. Ruiz working with all stakeholders to achieve an outcome that advances the state’s clean energy and environmental future,” said Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association. “EDF Renewables\\xa0appreciates the hard work by Senator Padilla and Representative Ruiz and all the stakeholders who have worked on the Chuckwalla National Monument proposal. Today’s legislation and map address our initial concerns about potential conflicts between a national monument and adjacent solar development focus areas.\\xa0The state of California and the Biden Administration share a commitment to rapid renewable energy deployment and land and tribal resource conservation.\\xa0We have engaged in this process with balancing those imperatives and appreciate the dedicated and detailed work to meet those objectives in this proposal,” said Virinder Singh, Vice President, Regulatory and Legislative Affairs, EDF Renewables. The proposed national monument has garnered diverse local support, including from current and former local elected officials, the Fort Yuma Quechan Indian Tribe, the Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians, the Twenty-Nine Palms Band of Mission Indians, the Chemehuevi Indian Tribe, the Colorado River Indian Tribes, the Cahuilla Band of Indians, the cities of Banning, Cathedral City, Desert Hot Springs, Indian Wells, Indio, and Palm Springs, SoCal Edison, Imperial Irrigation District, the Metropolitan Water District, over 100 local businesses, Chambers of Commerce, and residents of the eastern Coachella Valley and neighboring areas. A list of supporter quotes is available here. In addition to Senator Padilla, Senator Butler, and Representative Ruiz, Representatives Nanette Barragán (D-Calif.-44), Julia Brownley (D-Calif.-26), Salud Carbajal (D-Calif.-24), Tony Cárdenas (D-Calif.-29), J. Luis Correa (D-Calif.-46), Jim Costa (D-Calif.-21), Robert Garcia (D-Calif.-42), Jimmy Gomez (D-Calif.-34), Jared Huffman (D-Calif.-02), Ro Khanna (D-Calif.-17), Barbara Lee (D-Calif.-12), Mike Levin (D-Calif.-49), Ted Lieu (D-Calif.-36), Doris Matsui (D-Calif.-07), Kevin Mullin (D-Calif.-15), Jimmy Panetta (D-Calif.-19), Katie Porter (D-Calif.-47), Adam Schiff (D-Calif.-30), Brad Sherman (D-Calif.-32), Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.-14), Mark Takano (D-Calif.-39), Mike Thompson (D-Calif.-04), and Juan Vargas (D-Calif.-52) also signed the letter urging President Biden to designate the Chuckwalla National Monument. Senator Padilla has been a leader in increasing protections for public lands and access to outdoor recreation. Padilla\\xa0introduced legislation\\xa0to restore and expand protections for over 1 million acres of California’s public lands, which advanced\\xa0out of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources (ENR) last year. Padilla has also called on President Biden to expand two California national monuments. Last October, Senator Padilla, along with Representatives John Garamendi (D-Calif.-08) and Mike Thompson, led a letter\\xa0to President Biden and Interior Department Secretary Deb Haaland urging the Administration to use its authority under the\\xa0Antiquities Act of 1906\\xa0to expand the Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument to protect the entirety of Molok Luyuk.\\xa0In June 2023, Senator Padilla and Representative Judy Chu (D-Calif.-28) were joined\\xa0by elected officials and community leaders in urging the Biden administration to expand the boundary of California’s San Gabriel Mountains National Monument by issuing a presidential proclamation under the\\xa0Antiquities Act of 1906.\\xa0 A map of the proposed Chuckwalla National Monument and Joshua Tree National Park expansion is available here. Full text of the bill is available here. Full text of the letter is available here and below: Dear President Biden and Secretary Haaland: We write to request that you issue a proclamation under the Antiquities Act of 1906 to designate the Chuckwalla National Monument in eastern Imperial and Riverside counties in California. We have introduced the “Chuckwalla National Monument Establishment and Joshua Tree National Park Expansion Act of 2024” to conserve iconic and sensitive California landscapes, foster Tribal collaborative management of sacred public lands, and increase recreation and equitable access to the outdoors. Our bill would establish a new Chuckwalla National Monument to protect approximately 627,855 acres of public lands while also expanding Joshua Tree National Park by adding approximately 17,915 acres of previously designated public lands. We request that you use your authority under the Antiquities Act to protect these iconic landscapes included in the map titled “Proposed Chuckwalla National Monument and Joshua Tree National Park Expansion” and dated April 12, 2024. We also request that you visit the proposed designations and would be happy to host you for the visit this spring. Our efforts enjoy broad support from federal, tribal, state, and local officials, and was crafted in close coordination with affected communities and key stakeholders after years of grassroots advocacy to bring greater protections and recreation opportunities in the California Desert. Our legislation also carefully balances the land use needs of the energy industry so that as we protect our most sensitive landscapes, we also ensure that California and the nation are able to meet our clean energy goals. Our bill has earned support from numerous elected officials, businesses, conservation and outdoor recreation organizations, and key partners in the energy industry. We are proud of the support we have built to date and are confident that any Antiquities Act designation would enjoy equally broad support. The proposed Chuckwalla National Monument’s vast desert landscape spanning the area along Joshua Tree National Park’s southern boundary, along Interstate 10 from the eastern Coachella Valley, and all the way to the Colorado River are worthy of permanent protection. This area has a unique, biodiverse ecosystem, is home to habitats for species like the Chuckwalla lizard and the endangered desert tortoise, and contains critical migration corridors for desert bighorn sheep. This area is also cherished for outdoor recreation activities like hiking and rock climbing. Preserving this vast desert landscape will help ensure more equitable access to nature and recreation, protect biodiversity, and preserve decades of cultural riches, particularly for the local tribal communities. The lands we are proposing for protection include the homelands of the Iviatim, Nüwü, Pipa Aha Macav, Kwatsáan, and Maara’yam peoples (Cahuilla, Chemehuevi, Mojave, Quechan, and Serrano nations). Designating the Chuckwalla National Monument would help to protect important spiritual and cultural values tied to the land such as multi-use trail systems established by Indigenous peoples, sacred sites and objects, traditional cultural places, geoglyphs, petroglyphs, pictographs, and native plants and wildlife. Our legislation would also further our shared goals to honor Tribal sovereignty and advance cooperative management of federal public lands by allowing Tribes to voluntarily engage in cooperative management of the public lands within the National Monument. We hope that any presidential proclamation under the Antiquities Act would include similar direction for the Bureau of Land Management to provide ample opportunity for federally recognized tribes to co-steward the Monument. Finally, our legislation directs Interior to conduct an ethnographic study and cultural resources survey for the land within and adjacent to the proposed Monument to assess the importance of these lands to affected Indian Tribes. Establishing the Chuckwalla National Monument would contribute to the Administration’s goal under Executive Order 14008 of permanently conserving 30 percent of the United States lands and coastal waters by 2030, as well as the Administration’s America the Beautiful initiative, which is intended to address the three interlocking crises of nature loss, climate change, and inequitable access to the outdoors. Thank you for your leadership and consideration of our request. We look forward to working with you to permanently conserve this unique desert landscape in California for future generations to enjoy, and we would be pleased to host you for an in-person visit in the near future. Sincerely, ###',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Subcommittee on Fisheries, Water, and Wildlife, and Representative Scott Peters (D-Calif.-50) introduced the Drought Relief Obtained Using Government Help Today (DROUGHT) Act, legislation to help alleviate the Western water crisis caused by the long-term drought conditions affecting the Colorado River and its reservoirs. The bill would allow federal government loans to take on a greater share of the rising cost of water infrastructure projects. Currently, projects receiving assistance from the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) Program cannot accept assistance from the federal government for more than 80 percent of project costs, creating undue burdens for state and local governments. The DROUGHT Act would raise the limit from 80 percent to 90 percent for projects in areas experiencing extreme drought or serving historically disadvantaged communities. “Every American deserves access to reliable, clean drinking water and sanitation, but aging infrastructure and years of historic drought have stretched water systems and increased water bills across the West,”\\xa0said Senator Padilla.\\xa0“The\\xa0Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act\\xa0has successfully invested\\xa0billions of dollars\\xa0in\\xa0California water projects, and this legislation will provide critical additional financial relief for drought-stricken and disadvantaged communities.” “San Diegans know that we cannot take our water for granted — that’s why the city and county are investing in long-term solutions like Pure Water,”\\xa0said Representative Peters.\\xa0“My bill will make sure the federal government is also investing in the most basic needs of the millions of people in the West who are subject to drought. I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress and our local partners to pass this bill into law.” The DROUGHT Act would allow drought-impacted and underserved communities to both draw down additional federal funds and remain eligible for long-term, low-interest WIFIA loans. It does not affect the obligation of borrowers to repay their loans, the timeline for repayment, or interest rates of applicable loans. This bill would support San Diego’s landmark water-recycling project,\\xa0Pure Water, which will supply half of San Diego’s drinking water by 2035. Representatives Nanette Barragán (D-Calif.-44) and Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.-25) are cosponsoring the bill in the House of Representatives. Senator Padilla has long been a staunch advocate for water affordability and ensuring access to safe water throughout California and across the country. Last year, he was\\xa0named\\xa0Chair of the EPW\\xa0Subcommittee on Fisheries, Water, and Wildlife, where he leads federal efforts to improve water resiliency and oversees implementation of the\\xa0Clean Water Act\\xa0and\\xa0Safe Drinking Water Act. Padilla recently introduced the Low-Income Household Water Assistance Program (LIHWAP) Establishment Act, legislation that would establish a permanent, nationwide water assistance program to help families afford their water bills. He also\\xa0led 24 Senators\\xa0in requesting continued funding for LIHWAP in any funding legislation. More than 150 organizations — including water associations, environmental and public interest organizations, consumer advocates, and labor unions —\\xa0wrote\\xa0a similar letter urging Congress to provide FY24 funding for LIHWAP. Additionally, he and Representative Mike Levin (D-Calif.-49)\\xa0introduced\\xa0the\\xa0Water Efficiency, Conservation, and Sustainability Act of 2023, bicameral legislation that would authorize $550 million for states, municipalities, water systems, and tribal nations to implement water-efficiency upgrades and establish programs to repair leaks, especially in areas experiencing severe drought and in low-income communities.

       " 'WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, and Border Safety, issued the following statement after the Senate agreed that the articles of impeachment against U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas did not actually allege conduct that rises to the level of a high crime or misdemeanor as required under Article II, Section 4 of the United States Constitution: “Impeachment is a serious matter reserved for adjudicating high crimes and misdemeanors — it’s not for policy disagreements or political theatrics. “Secretary Mayorkas is an exemplary public servant who has dedicated his career to honorably serving the United States. House Republicans failed to provide a shred of evidence of any impeachable offenses. The Senate voted accordingly to deem these impeachment articles unconstitutional. “Rather than wasting time on these political stunts that vilify immigrants, I stand ready to work with my colleagues to actually address the root causes of migration and modernize our immigration system.” ###',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senators Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Chair of the Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Fisheries, Water, and Wildlife, and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) introduced bipartisan legislation to improve the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Civil Works environmental mitigation for USACE infrastructure projects. USACE Civil Works builds critical flood control, navigation, water supply, and recreational projects across the country. These infrastructure projects often impact terrestrial and aquatic species and waters covered under the Clean Water Act. Any USACE Civil Works projects that cause unavoidable adverse impacts to wetlands, streams, or other aquatic resources must be offset by restoration, establishment, enhancement, or preservation efforts in a process known as “compensatory mitigation.” Since 2015, the Corps has started or completed an average of just 58 percent of its required annual mitigation, according to annual status reports. This bill would provide USACE Civil Works with the same tools provided under the USACE Regulatory program’s 2008 final rule guiding mitigation requirements. It would also allow USACE Civil Works to contract with a third-party provider to properly and efficiently mitigate the environmental impacts for Civil Works projects. “As the Army Corps makes vital repairs to levees and critical infrastructure to protect against flooding, we must pair any disruptions to river flows or aquatic habitat with comparable and timely ecosystem restoration,” said Senator Padilla. “This legislation will help build lasting, sustainable flood infrastructure while saving taxpayer dollars and protecting the biodiversity of our waterways.” “North Carolina has a long track record of delivering successful mitigation projects to offset the ecological impacts of NC DOT projects,” said Senator Tillis. “I am proud to partner with Senator Padilla to expand this proven performance model to projects across the country and give the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers the flexibility needed to clear its unmet mitigation backlog.” “The way we mitigate the damages we cause makes a difference,” said Melissa Samet, Legal Director for Water Resources and Coasts at the National Wildlife Federation. “We hope the Corps will use the important tool provided by this legislation to implement more effective solutions that have better outcomes for people and wildlife.” “The Ecological Restoration Business Association (ERBA) applauds the leadership of Senator Padilla and Senator Tillis introducing the Improving Corps Civil Works Compensatory Mitigation Act. Clarifying the Corps’ authority to contract directly with mitigation providers for the ecological impacts of Civil Works projects equips the Corps with a tool to more efficiently offset impacts, improve environmental outcomes, address the backlog of outstanding mitigation liabilities, and align with the mitigation standards established in the 2008 Compensatory Mitigation Rule. This act will also help ensure that construction of critical life and safety Civil Works projects are not delayed by the Corps’ limitations to identify suitable mitigation options,” said Ecological Restoration Business Association (ERBA) Board President, Greg DeYoung. “We thank Senator Padilla and Senator Tillis for supporting policies that dramatically increase the speed and scale of ecological restoration to benefit fish and wildlife and their habitats,” said Alex Funk, Director of Water Resources with the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership. “As the Corps advances infrastructure projects to address critical water resource and community needs, it is critical to ensure that the Corps is offsetting its environmental impacts in the most efficient and effective way possible. The Improving Corps Civil Works Compensatory Mitigation Act will provide a much needed overhaul of the Corps mitigation efforts and address the Corps’ documented mitigation backlog.” California’s Sacramento region faces an especially urgent need to improve the delivery and durability of mitigation alongside Civil Works projects. The region is one of the most at-risk areas for flooding in the United States due to its location at the confluence of and within the floodplain of the American and Sacramento Rivers. Representatives Jared Huffman (D-Calif.-02) and Garret Graves (R-La.-06) are leading companion legislation in the House of Representatives. Senator Padilla has long been a staunch advocate for water affordability and ensuring access to safe water throughout California and across the country. In 2022, he supported the Senate passage of the bipartisan\\xa0Water Resources Development Act of 2022, which included several provisions championed by Padilla to authorize the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ civil works activities, including flood control and dam safety, navigation, and ecosystem restoration throughout California and across the country. He has consistently supported USACE projects to help control flooding in the Sacramento region, including to plan, engineer, and design flood control for Lower Cache Creek in Yolo County. He and the late Senator Dianne Feinstein also secured $870 million for USACE water projects in California from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the FY22 omnibus funding bill.

       " 'WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senators Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Todd Young (R-Ind.), and Patty Murray (D-Wash.) introduced bipartisan legislation to accelerate the development of commercial fusion energy. The Fusion Energy Act would codify the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s (NRC) regulatory authority over commercial fusion energy systems to streamline the creation of clear federal regulations to support the development of commercial production facilities. Fusion energy has the potential to produce abundant clean electricity without harmful side effects like carbon emissions or long-lived radioactive waste. Fusion energy commercialization can be a key component in the United States’ efforts to fully decarbonize the grid by 2050. In December 2022, California’s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), a global leader in fusion technology, became the first lab to achieve fusion ignition — meaning more energy was released than was needed for the reaction. On April 14, 2023, NRC voted to separate the regulatory frameworks of fusion and fission energy and create a unique regulatory framework for fusion energy. The Fusion Energy Act would ensure the development of a tailored NRC regulatory framework geared toward supporting the growth of the emerging commercial fusion energy sector. The legislation would also require the NRC to study and report to Congress within one year regarding licensing commercial fusion machines, including streamlining considerations. “Fusion energy holds the potential to power the entire country with a sustainable supply of nearly unlimited, reliable, and carbon-free electricity,” said Senator Padilla. “The breakthrough of fusion ignition at California’s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is a key step toward meeting our nation’s critical clean energy goals and cementing U.S. leadership in fusion energy. We now need clear regulatory authority to scale up commercial American fusion energy facilities and incentivize fusion investments.” “Fusion energy offers a potential clean, safe power source that can help meet our nation’s energy needs,” said Senator Cornyn. “I am proud to support advancements in fusion technology as part of Texas’ all-of-the-above energy economy.” “New Jersey has long been at the forefront of fusion research and innovation, driving the future of clean energy,” said Senator Booker. “By implementing this regulatory framework, this bill will\\xa0propel fusion energy forward as a potential source of abundant carbon-free energy. I’m proud to join my colleagues to champion legislation that will unlock the potential of fusion to combat climate change and drive economic growth.” “Our bipartisan bill marks a pivotal step in advancing\\xa0fusion energy, which\\xa0has the potential to usher in a new era of\\xa0energy production in America.\\xa0By establishing a clear regulatory framework,\\xa0this bill would improve\\xa0the research and development of fusion capabilities, enabling commercialization and reaffirming American leadership in innovation and technology,”\\xa0said Senator Young. “Fusion energy holds tremendous promise as a source of clean, cheap, and abundant energy—and Washington state is quickly becoming a global leader in the development of fusion. Our legislation will help provide the certainty needed to speed fusion research, development, and deployment—unlocking more clean power and bringing down energy costs for families. I’ll continue to work with my colleagues to realize the promise of fusion energy and ensure the United States, and Washington state in particular, maintain our leadership on this groundbreaking technology,” said Senator Murray. “Clear guidance through an appropriate regulatory framework is essential to the emerging fusion field. LLNL looks forward to partnering with Sen. Padilla and others in Congress in support of U.S. leadership in fusion energy, as the Lab continues to set historic records in fusion at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) — our unique national security experimental facility that supports the Nation’s strategic deterrent and provides fundamental data that also paves the way toward a fusion energy future,” said Dr. Kimberly Budil, Laboratory Director, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. “The Fusion Industry Association (FIA) has consistently supported regulatory and legislative efforts to provide certainty in the regulation of fusion energy. We support efforts to permanently and completely separate the regulation of fusion energy from the regulation of fission, and look forward to continuing to work with Members of Congress to see this enacted into law,” said Andrew Holland, Chief Executive Officer, Fusion Industry Association. Congressional Fusion Energy Caucus Co-Chairs Lori Trahan (D-Mass.-03),\\xa0Don Beyer (D-Va.-08),\\xa0Chuck Fleischmann (R-Tenn.-03), and\\xa0Jay Obernolte (R-Calif.-23) passed companion legislation in the House of Representatives. Last year, Senator Padilla welcomed the Department of Energy’s (DOE)\\xa0announcement of\\xa0$42 million for a program to establish three hubs to advance inertial fusion energy, including $16 million for a hub led by the DOE’s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory\\xa0in Livermore, California. Additionally, Padilla and Representative Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.-18) pushed\\xa0President Biden to support the inclusion of over $1 billion in FY24 funding for the Fusion Energy Sciences program within the DOE’s Office of Science, consistent with the amount authorized in the\\xa0CHIPS and Science Act.

       " 'WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senators Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Subcommittee on Fisheries, Water, and Wildlife, Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.), and Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) introduced the Drought Resilient Infrastructure Act to provide new resources and authorities\\xa0through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers\\xa0(USACE) to support communities experiencing long-term drought conditions. The Drought Resilient Infrastructure Act enables USACE to prioritize water conservation efforts at Corps facilities, establishes new emergency authorities that direct USACE to prioritize conservation at multi-benefit projects during times of drought, and bolsters programs to help states, counties, cities, tribes, and other water users construct projects that respond to or prevent worsening drought conditions. “As the West recovers from years of severe drought, we must ensure that states can rely on the U.S. Army Corps’ support for drought resilience projects without delay,” said Senator Padilla. “The climate crisis demands that we stay prepared for flood control, conserve water, and streamline federal investments in drought-stricken communities during the dry years that stress our water supply. This legislation would also support tribes across the Colorado River Basin while protecting public safety and water rights.” “As Arizona and the west continue to face a historic drought, it’s essential to have all hands on deck to combat the problem,” said Senator Kelly. “This legislation will make sure the Army Corps steps up to put their vast water infrastructure resources and expertise to work for states, tribes, and communities as they respond and adapt to drought conditions.” “As Arizona faces record drought conditions, we’re working together to deliver innovative solutions securing our water future. Our new bill expands our water storage capabilities to ensure a lasting water supply for generations to come,” said Senator Sinema. “As New Mexico continues to grapple with the impacts of long-term drought and aridification, I’m focused on ensuring that our government is using every tool available to protect our water sources. Expanding the Army Corps of Engineers’ ability to protect our rivers is a big part of that. I’m proud to introduce this legislation, building on our recent investments in water infrastructure projects across our state, to ensure the long-term health and vitality of the water our communities depend on,” said Senator Heinrich. The Corps operates more than 700 dams, maintains 900 harbors, and oversees 12,000 miles of inland waterways. As various regions of the country experience drought conditions, the Corps is well-positioned to bolster water supply, manage navigable waterways during times of drought, and fund infrastructure improvements that help communities and water users better prepare for and respond to drought conditions.\\xa0Yet in many instances, the Army Corps of Engineers lacks the necessary authorities to quickly modify the operation of existing Corps facilities or invest in infrastructure improvements in response to drought conditions. The Drought Resilient Infrastructure Act gives the Army Corps of Engineers the necessary tools to respond to drought conditions and better manage scarce water resources.\\xa0Specifically, the legislation gives the Army Corps new authorities on the areas of water conservation measures, emergency drought operations, and drought resilience projects. Additionally, the bill amends and funds existing authorities and programs to increase water supply, reduce the risk of floods and other natural hazards, and support tribal communities. Senator Padilla has long been a staunch advocate for building drought resilience and ensuring access to safe water throughout California and across the country. Earlier this week, Padilla and Representative Scott Peters (D-Calif.-50) introduced the DROUGHT Act, legislation to help alleviate the Western water crisis caused by the long-term drought conditions affecting the Colorado River and its reservoirs by allowing government loans to take on a greater share of the rising cost of water infrastructure projects. Last year, he and Representative Mike Levin (D-Calif.-49)\\xa0introduced\\xa0the\\xa0Water Efficiency, Conservation, and Sustainability Act of 2023, bicameral legislation that would authorize $550 million for states, municipalities, water systems, and tribal nations to implement water-efficiency upgrades and establish programs to repair leaks, especially in areas experiencing severe drought and in low-income communities. Last year, Padilla was\\xa0named\\xa0Chair of the EPW\\xa0Subcommittee on Fisheries, Water, and Wildlife, where he leads federal efforts to improve water resiliency and oversees implementation of the\\xa0Clean Water Act\\xa0and\\xa0Safe Drinking Water Act. Padilla recently introduced the Low-Income Household Water Assistance Program (LIHWAP) Establishment Act, legislation that would establish a permanent, nationwide water assistance program to help families afford their water bills. The bill has since received bipartisan support in the House of Representatives. Padilla also\\xa0led 24 Senators\\xa0in requesting continued funding for LIHWAP in any funding legislation.

This rule will play an essential role in safeguarding miners from cancers, silicosis and black lung disease, especially in Appalachia where black lung cases have been rapidly increasing in recent years. For generations, our brave coal miners have risked their lives to power our nation to greatness, and we will continue working together in the Senate to advance commonsense rules like this one to protect the health and welfare of these heroes,” the senators said.  “We're grateful for the Agency's initiative in implementing a rule to tackle the increasing incidence of silica-related lung diseases among both coal and metal non-metal miners. The resurgence of these diseases, particularly affecting younger miners in their 30s and 40s, underscores the urgency of this issue. This measure is vital for safeguarding miners' well-being not only in the short term but throughout their careers. The UMWA’s focus now shifts to ensuring mining companies are held accountable,” said United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) International President Cecil E. Roberts. Warner and Kaine have long worked to support miners, miner retirees, and their families. The\\xa0Fiscal Year 2024 government funding bill\\xa0included $12.2 million in federal funding for Black Lung Clinics. The\\xa0Inflation Reduction Act, which Warner and Kaine voted to pass,\\xa0included a permanent extension of the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund’s excise tax at a higher rate, providing certainty for miners, miner retirees, and their families who rely on the fund to access benefits. This followed Warner and Kaine’s successful efforts to ensure that miners receive the\\xa0pensions\\xa0and\\xa0health care\\xa0they earned. Last November, Warner and Kaine introduced legislation to strengthen the Black Lung Benefits Program. Last July, Warner and Kaine\\xa0introduced\\xa0the\\xa0Relief for Survivors of Miners Act, which would ease restrictions to make it easier for miners’ survivors to successfully claim benefits. In 2023, Kaine invited United Mine Workers of America leader James Gibbs, a third-generation coal miner from Dickenson County, to attend the State of the Union as his guest to highlight the important contributions of miners and the need to support them. \\xa0 ###\",\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON, D.C. —\\xa0Today, on the 17th anniversary of the tragic shooting at Virginia Tech, U.S. Senators Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine introduced the Virginia Plan to Reduce Gun Violence Act, legislation to federally enact a series of commonsense gun violence prevention measures adopted by Virginia since 2020.\\xa0The bill includes provisions to mandate reporting of lost and stolen firearms, prevent children from accessing firearms, and implement a one-handgun-a-month policy. “17 years ago, 32 people tragically lost their lives at Virginia Tech. I was Virginia’s governor at the time, and I remember that day like it was yesterday—grieving with families, friends, and the Hokie community. Sadly, far too many communities throughout the United States know the pain of horrific gun violence,” said Kaine. “I’m proud of the steps the Commonwealth has taken in recent years to help keep Virginians safe, which is why I’m introducing this bill to build on our progress by implementing those commonsense measures on the national level. We must do more to ensure everyone can go to school, work, their place of worship, a grocery store, or concert without the terror of gun violence.” \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 “On the 17th anniversary of Virginia’s deadliest mass shooting, I’m joining my friend Sen. Kaine in introducing the Virginia Plan, legislation to bring the commonsense gun violence measures Virginia has enacted to the rest of the country,” said Warner. “Too many Americans, families, and communities have been touched by gun violence. This bill can save lives and make our country safer.” The\\xa0Virginia Plan to Reduce Gun Violence Act of 2024\\xa0would build on Virginia’s commonsense framework to reduce gun violence from 2020 and Lucia’s Law, which takes effect in Virginia on July 1, 2024, through the following provisions: \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Warner and Kaine have long-supported a comprehensive approach to curbing gun violence. In June 2022, Warner and Kaine helped pass the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, legislation that contains many provisions of the Virginia Plan, including improving background checks, strengthening safeguards for victims of domestic violence, and incentivizing states to implement their own Extreme Risk Protection Orders to remove firearms from individuals who pose a high risk of harming themselves or others. The Department of Justice issued a rule last week—which the senators applauded—to codify provisions outlined in the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to close the gun show loophole, which permitted the sale of firearms online and at gun shows without background checks.

       " 'WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (SFRC) and Chair of the SFRC Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, Transnational Crime, Civilian Security, Democracy, Human Rights, and Global Women’s Issues, applauded committee passage of his bipartisan bill to address the horrific human rights crisis in Nicaragua and his bipartisan resolution in support of the Alliance for Development in Democracy (ADD). The ADD is an important initiative among Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, and Panama to promote democracy and economic growth. “What happens in Latin American affects us right here at home, whether it’s migration at our southern border or narcotrafficking at our ports. I’ve long argued that we need to work more closely with our neighbors in the Western Hemisphere and strengthen our partnerships to ensure the region’s prosperity and security. That’s why I’m glad the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted to pass my bipartisan legislation to address human rights in Nicaragua and to reaffirm the importance of the Alliance for Development in Democracy. Supporting human rights, democratic governance, and rule of law in the hemisphere, which this legislation does, will help us work together to address crime, corruption, and the resulting surge in migration. I urge the full Senate to pass this legislation as soon as possible.”  Kaine’s bipartisan Restoring Sovereignty and Human Rights in Nicaragua Act of 2023 with Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) would extend the U.S. government’s authority to impose sanctions on the Nicaraguan regime through December 31, 2028. It would also expand sanctions to include Nicaraguan officials responsible for violations of the human rights of religious believers, direct the U.S. State Department to enforce sectoral sanctions, and direct the State Department to work with allies and partners to stop providing investment to Nicaragua through the Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI). Kaine’s bipartisan resolution with Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) reiterates U.S. support for the Alliance for Development in Democracy (ADD). The resolution calls on the U.S. to prioritize engagement and strengthen ties with ADD countries. As a block, ADD countries represent one of America’s largest trading partners in the region. In 2022, Kaine spent a week meeting with leaders throughout Costa Rica, Panama, and the Dominican Republic to express his support and appreciation for the countries’ formation of the ADD in 2021. Several other pieces of legislation cosponsored by Kaine were also voted out of committee, including the bipartisan Mahsa Amini Human Rights and Security Accountability Act to impose targeted sanctions on Iran’s Supreme Leader and other high-level Iranian officials for human rights abuses, a bipartisan resolution condemning Hamas’ use of sexual violence and rape as a weapon of war, and a bipartisan resolution calling for the immediate release of Wall Street Journal reporter and U.S. citizen Evan Gershkovich, who was detained by the Russian government. ###',\n",

The announcement comes shortly after ED shared that nearly 70,000 Virginians had their student loans forgiven under President Biden. “Too many Americans are crushed by the weight of student debt, which hurts our overall economy. I’m glad the Administration is taking steps to provide targeted student loan relief to millions of borrowers. This will help put them on better financial footing, so they can buy a home or start a business. I will continue working to ease the burden of student debt and make sure every American who wants to pursue higher education has the opportunity to do so.”  The proposed rule includes a series of changes that would cancel runaway interest; eliminate student debt for borrowers who entered repayment at least 20 years ago; assist borrowers who are eligible for loan forgiveness under existing programs but have not successfully applied due to paperwork, bad advice, or other obstacles; and authorize ongoing relief for borrowers who took out debt to attend programs or institutions that failed to provide sufficient financial value. The proposed changes are subject to a 30-day public comment period starting on April 17. Kaine has long supported efforts to lower student loan debt and make post-secondary education more affordable by increasing Pell Grant awards,\\xa0expanding Pell Grant eligibility to job training programs,\\xa0expanding access to Public Service Loan Forgiveness, providing financial counseling to students and their families on the front-end,\\xa0expanding dual enrollment and early college high school programs, and making it easier to transfer from community colleges to four-year schools.\\xa0\\xa0 ###',\n",
       " \"Ruling Follows Bipartisan, Bicameral Effort Led by McClellan and Kaine WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Congresswoman Jennifer McClellan (VA-04) and Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA) celebrated the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in Rudisill v. McDonough, Secretary of Veteran Affairs. The Court ruled 7-2 in favor of James Rudisil and held that veterans who served multiple tours have the right to access all educational benefits that they are entitled to under the Post-9/11 GI Bill and the Montgomery GI Bill. The ruling follows an amicus brief led by McClellan and Kaine and signed by 14 Members of the House and Senate.\\xa0 “James Rudisill represents the very best of our Commonwealth and served our country with honor and distinction. I am thrilled the Supreme Court ruled in his favor and upheld his right to access the benefits he was promised and rightfully deserves,” said Rep. McClellan. “This ruling is a win for Mr. Rudisill and the more than 1.7 million veterans eligible for both the Montgomery GI Bill and the Post-9/11 GI Bill. I was honored to join Senator Kaine in leading an amicus brief to the Court. I will always fight to ensure our servicemembers and veterans have access to the resources they need.”\\xa0 “Our veterans sacrificed so much to keep our country safe, and we owe it to them to keep our word and administer the benefits they were promised in return,” said Sen. Kaine. “I commend today’s Supreme Court decision in favor of Virginia veteran James Rudisill, who was denied the full benefits he earned under the G.I. bill. I am proud to have led a bipartisan, bicameral group of my colleagues in submitting an amicus brief in support of Mr. Rudisill’s case and will continue to do all I can through my work on the Senate Armed Services Committee to advocate for servicemembers, veterans and their families.”\\xa0 “James Rudisill bravely served his country with courage and selflessness, yet was denied the benefits he earned through his multiple periods of military service,” said Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA). The purpose of the Post-9/11 GI Bill was to ensure that the men and women of our armed services received appropriate earned benefits for their service to our country. Attempts to deny or limit these benefits run counter to the spirit of the law, meant to honor and support the millions of veterans who have sacrificed so much for our nation both before and following 9/11. I am thrilled that the Supreme Court has stood by our servicemembers to ensure that they may receive the entirety of the benefits they deserve.”\\xa0 “This landmark decision will be life-changing for thousands of post and pre-9/11 veterans. The Supreme Court ruling guarantees that James Rudisill and other veterans of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq will have full access to the educational benefits they earned when they volunteered to go to war,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT). “We have a sacred obligation to care for those who bore the battle when they return home and this decision reaffirms that promise.” “Thanks to James Rudisill, thousands of veterans across the country will have full access to the educational benefits they earned,” said Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA). “We have a sacred obligation to care for those who served our nation in uniform and I am proud to have joined my colleagues to stand with James in his fight to ensure we live up to that promise.” “I am thrilled that the Supreme Court has ruled in favor of James Rudisill, a veteran and patriot who deserves nothing less than the full benefits he is owed,” said Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-VA-11). “Our veterans sacrifice enough without having to face bureaucratic hoops and hurdles at home. May this be an opportunity for all of us to recommit ourselves to the care and wellbeing of our veterans when they return home.” “Today’s decision is a win for Mr. Rudisill and veterans across the country. I was proud to be the original House sponsor of the Post 9/11 G.I. Bill,” said Rep. Robert C. “Bobby” Scott (D-VA-03). “Veterans have earned their educational benefits, and I will continue to advocate for the benefits they are entitled to through their service to our country.”\\xa0 “In August, I joined this bipartisan, bicameral group of my colleagues in supporting Virginian and decorated U.S. Army Veteran and FBI Special Agent James Rudisill after the VA denied his Post-9/11 GI Bill education benefits,” said Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-VA-07). “I am very pleased to hear that, today, the Supreme Court has ruled in favor of Mr. Rudisill, upholding that Veterans have access to the educational benefits they're entitled to under the GI Bill. Every American servicemember who accepted the risk and answered the call to serve our country should receive the full support and benefits they’ve earned through their service — and I am hopeful that this ruling will help provide many servicemembers and Veterans across our Commonwealth and our country with the opportunities they were promised.” FBI Special Agent Rudisill is a Richmond resident, who served in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan during three periods of active-duty military service: 2000 to 2002 as an enlisted member and 2007 to 2011 as a commissioned officer. After completing his first tour, Rudisill applied for – and received – education benefits under the Montgomery GI Bill to complete his undergraduate degree. Following his subsequent periods of service, Rudisill applied for the more generation education benefits offered under the post 9/11 GI Bill in order to attend divinity school and return to the Army as a minister. The Department of Veterans Affairs unfairly denied him the benefits he was promised, and Rudisill had to forfeit his offer to divinity school as a result.\\xa0 In August, McClellan and Kaine led a bipartisan, bicameral group of lawmakers to submit an amicus brief to the Supreme Court in support of Rudisill. In the House, McClellan was joined by Reps.

       " \"The “Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act” Would Establish New “Digital Skills at Work” Grant Program to Expand Digital Workforce Skills for Americans Seeking Employment or Upskilling Opportunities WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger (D-VA-07), U.S. Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA), and U.S. Representative David Valadao (R-CA-22) introduced bipartisan, bicameral legislation to expand access to digital skills training for American job seekers. According to the National Skills Coalition and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, 92 percent of today’s jobs require digital skills. Nearly one third of workers do not have the foundational digital skills — such as email, spreadsheets, or data entry — to enter and succeed in today’s workforce. Americans who can qualify for jobs requiring at least one digital skill earn 23 percent more income on average annually. Despite high demand across industries, digital skills training is not currently listed as an allowable use under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), federal legislation enacted to help job seekers access employment, education, training, and support services to succeed in the labor market. Because of this lack of allowance, one-stop workforce development career centers — physical sites within local workforce development areas across the United States where job seekers and employers can access programs, services, and resources — do not offer any digital skills training opportunities. The bipartisan, bicameral Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act would amend WIOA to establish a new “Digital Skills at Work” grant program to expand digital skills training within postsecondary education, adult education, and workforce development systems. This legislation would make specific, targeted investments in digital skills training to help Americans seeking jobs or upskilling opportunities and Americans with barriers to employment learn or build digital skills. Additionally, this bill would advance access to good-paying jobs and support the development of digitally resilient education and workforce systems. “When we help job seekers learn and refine on-the-job skills, we are helping Americans advance their careers and helping businesses hold on to adept and experienced employees. This bipartisan, bicameral legislation would empower states, localities, and local organizations — that are already doing incredible work to support our local workforces — to assist Virginians and Americans across the country in learning and building the industry-specific digital skills that will help them succeed in our 21st century economy,” said Spanberger. “Investments to close the digital skills gap help our workforce and our communities stay competitive and stay ahead, and I’m grateful for the support of Senator Kaine and Congressman Valadao as we work to deliver this support.” “Digital skills can be a gateway to new job opportunities for so many Virginians, especially at a time when I’m hearing from employers across the Commonwealth about how hard they’re working to hire up,” said Kaine. “The Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act would make it easier for people to access high-quality digital training programs to develop or hone those skills. Investing in our workforce is good for our workers, employers, and overall economy, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join us in supporting this bill.” “Ensuring people have the digital skills they need to navigate the modern job market is critical to the strength of our economy,” said Valadao. “When people enter the workforce with the foundational skills they need, it not only eases the burden on employers, but it sets people on a path to success for the rest of their careers. I’m proud to join Rep. Spanberger in introducing this bipartisan legislation that will help better prepare our workforce and strengthen our economy.” The bipartisan, bicameral Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act is endorsed by a number of local Chambers of Commerce, workforce development boards, education systems, and national education and skills training organizations — including the Virginia Chamber of Commerce, Northern Virginia Chamber of Commerce, Prince William Chamber of Commerce, Fredericksburg Regional Chamber of Commerce, Northern Virginia Black Chamber of Commerce, Virginia Minority Chambers, Inc., Virginia Community College System, Bay Consortium Workforce Development Board, National Skills Coalition, Coalition on Adult Basic Education, Hispanic Federation, National Coalition for Literacy, National Digital Inclusion Alliance, NTEN, American Libraries Association, and Third Way. “Digital skills are essential for both employers and employees. As technology continues to evolve, businesses must equip their workforce with the necessary skills to adapt and excel. For the Commonwealth of Virginia and our nation, we must invest in digital skills training, including upskilling and reskilling, to empower them to stay competitive in a rapidly changing digital world,” said Barry DuVal, President & CEO, Virginia Chamber of Commerce “The Northern Virginia Chamber strongly endorses Congresswoman Spanberger and Senator Kaine’s Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act. In the 2023 Virginia General Assembly session the Northern Virginia Chamber was the leading advocate for the Youngkin Administration's Workforce Consolidation effort. This legislation will build on that effort and ensure that Virginia and the nation’s workforce will have the digital skills needed to be productive in the 21st century economy,” said Julie Coons, President & CEO, Northern Virginia Chamber of Commerce. “Today 92% of jobs require digital skills and currently a third of American workers do not have access to training to participate in today's economy. We applaud Congresswoman Spanberger, Congressman David Valadao (R-CA) and Senator Tim Kaine for working in a bipartisan fashion to create grant programs for states and localities to help close the gap on these critical skills for today's workers. We look forward to continuing to work to ensure this legislation is enacted into law.” “The Prince William Chamber of Commerce fully supports upskilling the American workforce,” said Bob Sweeney, President & CEO, Prince William Chamber of Commerce. “The proposed legislation hits the right folks at the right time! It provides an opportunity for ALL to access the essential digital skills required in the high-demand, high-wage sectors like Data Centers, modern manufacturing and other technology jobs.” “The demand for the current digital workforce is high and will only grow in the future,” said Kevin Dillard, Chair of the Board of Directors, Fredericksburg Regional Chamber. “Providing this opportunity to continue to build upon the digital skills of the workforce of today and of the future is paramount.” “The Northern Virginia Black Chamber of Commerce is proud to support the Digital Skills for Today's Workforce Act, spearheaded by Congresswoman Spanberger and Senator Kaine and supported by bipartisan leaders including Rep. Valadao. This groundbreaking legislation addresses an urgent need within our workforce, where the digital divide continues to be a barrier to employment, particularly for communities of color, low-income families, and rural populations,” said Samuel Wiggins, Board Chair, Northern Virginia Black Chamber of Commerce. “As a chamber, our mission is to advocate for economic empowerment and to provide opportunities that foster business growth and workforce development among Black entrepreneurs and professionals. By endorsing this bill, which establishes the 'Digital Skills at Work' grant program under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, we are helping to ensure that our members and their communities are not left behind in the rapidly evolving digital economy.\\xa0 The Northern Virginia Black Chamber of Commerce is committed to championing policies that tackle longstanding disparities and actively promote the economic development and success of our region and the entire country.” “Virginia Minority Chambers, Inc., fully endorses the upcoming Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act, introduced by Congresswoman Spanberger and Senator Kaine with bipartisan leaders like Rep. Valadao. This legislation addresses a pressing national issue—a digital skills gap affecting one-third of the US workforce—with a disproportionate impact on minority workers, low-income individuals, and rural residents due to historic underinvestment and structural inequities,” said Tonya Poindexter, Chief Operating Officer, Virginia Minority Chambers, Inc. “By establishing the 'Digital Skills at Work' grant program under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, the bill seeks to provide foundational digital skills necessary for success in today’s job market. Virginia Minority Chambers, Inc. appreciates the recognition of this critical need at the federal level and is committed to working with our federal and state partners to enhance both individual economic opportunities, especially in underserved communities, and the overall economic competitiveness of our nation. The passing of this bill is a vital step toward improving employment prospects across the country and ensuring our workforce is equipped to meet the demands of the digital age, particularly for those most affected by existing disparities.” “The introduction of Digital Skills for Today's Workforce Act is a groundbreaking achievement for workforce stakeholders across the country. The bill supports National Skills Coalition research that finds that ninety-two percent of today’s jobs require digital skills, but only two thirds of workers have the foundational digital skills they need to succeed in today’s economy,” said Caroline Treschitta, Senior Government Affairs Manager, National Skills Coalition. “The bipartisan Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act addresses the digital skill divide by equipping workers and businesses with the digital training they need to ensure America remains competitive in the global economy.” Specifically, the Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act would: Click here for the full bill text. ###\",\n",

DCA’s overburdened runway is already the busiest in the country—and we fear that adding more flights could put passenger safety at serious jeopardy. We are thankful there was no loss of life or injuries, but this close call is unacceptable and we must ensure even near misses never occur again. To state the obvious: passenger safety should be a higher priority than whether some lawmakers have a direct flight home from DCA.” A visualization of the near miss is available here. The near-miss underscores the urgent need to reject any changes to slot and perimeter rules, which govern the number of flights that can safely operate out of DCA and the distance of those flights. In February, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation voted to alter the current slot and perimeter rules to increase the number of flights in and out of DCA as part of the Senate version of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization Act. The senators have repeatedly opposed changes to the slot and perimeter rules. In March, they sent a letter to the Chairs and Ranking Members of the Senate Commerce and House Transportation & Infrastructure Committee opposing any changes to the rules in the FAA reauthorization. They also penned an\\xa0op-ed\\xa0last June urging their colleagues to oppose changes to the rules. ###',\n",
       " ' \\r\\nProject is expected to bring more than $400 million in investments, creating 150 direct jobs in Virginia and over 1,000 indirect domestic jobs WASHINGTON, D.C.—Today, U.S. Senators Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine and U.S. Representative Jennifer McClellan released the following statement after Topsoe announced it will build a new manufacturing facility in Chesterfield County, Virginia thanks to nearly $136 million in tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which the lawmakers championed in 2022. Topsoe is a Danish company that manufactures solid oxide electrolyzer cells (SOEC), a crucial component for producing clean hydrogen. The project is expected to bring more than $400 million in investments and create at least 150 new jobs in Virginia. Warner, Kaine, and McClellan wrote a letter to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to advocate for the project’s application. “The Inflation Reduction Act represented a bold step towards maintaining American leadership in manufacturing, creating the next generation of clean energy jobs, and combatting climate change,” said Warner. “I’m glad to see that vision executed in Chesterfield County with the announcement of a new Topsoe manufacturing facility. Thanks to tax credits from this landmark law, Virginia will continue to power our nation and lead the clean energy transition by creating good-paying manufacturing jobs across the Commonwealth.” “I’m thrilled that Topsoe will be setting up a state-of-the-art facility in Chesterfield County to help manufacture clean energy components,” said Kaine. “This wouldn’t have been possible without the investments we made in the Inflation Reduction Act, which I was proud to have helped pass in the Senate by one vote. I look forward to seeing how this project will boost economic growth, create jobs, and help us build a clean energy future.” “This new Topsoe facility in Chesterfield County will create hundreds of new jobs and stimulate millions of dollars in economic activity right here in Virginia’s Fourth,” said McClellan. “I will continue fighting with Senators Warner and Kaine to supercharge our transition to a clean-energy future and bring federal investments to our Commonwealth.” “We are thrilled to announce our plans for a new\\xa0state-of the art US facility that will manufacture Solid Oxide\\xa0Electrolyzer\\xa0Cell stacks (SOEC),\\xa0the key element to the world’s most efficient electrolyzer technology for\\xa0producing clean hydrogen,” said Roeland Baan, CEO of Topsoe.\\xa0“Through legislation like the Inflation Reduction Act and strong support from individual states such as Virginia, the US government is helping to accelerate the clean energy transition. With our strong dedication to innovation, we will help the US achieve its goals of driving down the cost of clean hydrogen and delivering clean energy jobs.” The IRA included a number of provisions and tax credits to incentivize investments in clean energy. Topsoe received a tax credit through the DOE’s Advanced Energy Project Credit (48C) program, which was expanded as part of the IRA. The 48C tax credit covers 30 percent of the amount invested in new or upgraded facilities that build renewable energy components. The IRA included a set-aside in the 48C program for coal communities, which Chesterfield qualified for due to the retirement of a nearby coal-fired electric generating unit. ###',\n",
       " 'Fischer’s Legislation Is the Only Permanent, Nationwide Solution to Year-Round E15 U.S.\\xa0Senator Deb\\xa0Fischer (R-Neb.), a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, joined her colleagues in sending a bipartisan letter urging President Biden to permit the summertime sale of E15 fuel.In their letter, the Senators\\xa0note that American biofuels are a clean and reliable energy solution that will help drive down fuel costs for consumers. U.S. Senators John Thune (R-S.D.) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) led the letter.This Congress, Senator Fischer led the introduction of legislation to allow the year-round, nationwide sale of ethanol blends higher than 10% — ending years of regulatory uncertainty and preventing a patchwork of uneven state regulations. Increasing the availability of biofuels like E15 would benefit the economy and the environment. Her legislation has support from a wide mix of stakeholders, including the National Corn Growers Association, Renewable Fuels Association, Growth Energy, and the American Petroleum Institute.“As you know, the consideration of state action has led to a historic agreement between liquid fuel stakeholders in support of securing a permanent legislative solution to allow nationwide, year-round E15 sales, while respecting each state’s authority to opt-out of such a program,”\\xa0wrote the Senators. “Taking temporary action now will continue the uninterrupted sale of E15 for what would be the sixth consecutive year, a major win for consumer choice and emissions reductions.”“[W]e must pursue an all-of-the-above energy strategy, which includes leveraging domestic biofuels,”\\xa0the Senators continued.\\xa0“As your previous temporary waivers have proven, permitting the sale of higher blends of biofuels like E15 through the summer driving season bolsters the domestic fuel supply, lowers consumer costs, and promotes the environmental benefits of American biofuels and modern agriculture.”“All of the conditions that made an E15 waiver so important in past years are still present,”\\xa0said Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy.\\xa0“If EPA doesn’t take action, American motorists would lose access to a more affordable fuel option this summer. We can’t afford to wait any longer – we need EPA to act now. We commend Senator Thune, Senator Durbin, and other bipartisan Senate biofuel champions for pushing the administration to do the right thing and allow E15 to be sold this summer.”“Providing continued access to a more affordable, lower-carbon fuel, like E15, will not only save drivers money at the pump, but it will also help farmers across the country,”\\xa0said Harold Wolle, president of the National Corn Growers Association.\\xa0“Yet, time is of the essence as we quickly approach the summer months. We are deeply appreciative to the bipartisan support we are receiving from our Senate champions on this issue.”“We thank Senators Thune and Durbin, along with all other Senate supporters, for calling on the Biden administration to quickly take action to allow the nationwide sale of E15 through the coming summer,”\\xa0said Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association.\\xa0“These senators understand that with ongoing geopolitical conflicts and the current oil and fuel supplies being at lower levels than the last two summer driving seasons, it is more important than ever that U.S. consumers have access to E15, the American made, lower-cost and cleaner-burning fuel.”In addition to Senators Fischer, Thune, and Durbin, the letter was signed by U.S. SenatorsTammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Pete Ricketts (R-Neb.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), and J.D. Vance (R-Ohio).Full text of the letter is available\\xa0here\\xa0or below.\\xa0April 11, 2024The Honorable Joseph R. Biden Jr.\\xa0PresidentThe White House1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.Washington, D.C. 20500Dear President Biden:We write to request that you again take swift executive action to permit the sale of E15 fuel during the 2024 summer driving season by extending the Reid vapor pressure (RVP) waiver, nationwide, from June 1 through September 15.\\xa0Enabling the year-round sale of E15, as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) permitted in both 2022 and 2023 through nationwide temporary waivers under Clean Air Act Section 211(c)(4)(C)(ii), helped allow our energy supply chain to “address extreme and unusual fuel supply circumstances caused by the war in Ukraine that are affecting all regions of the nation.” Unfortunately, this underlying justification remains applicable as Russia’s war of aggression continues to weigh on global energy and security. Further, Iran-backed aggression in the Middle East, specifically Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, presents new threats to global energy markets and our energy security.To counter these influences, we must pursue an all-of-the-above energy strategy, which includes leveraging domestic biofuels. As your previous temporary waivers have proven, permitting the sale of higher blends of biofuels like E15 through the summer driving season bolsters the domestic fuel supply, lowers consumer costs, and promotes the environmental benefits of American biofuels and modern agriculture.Furthermore, temporary action is again required in light of the EPA’s announcement to postpone until 2025 the implementation of eight state petitions to sell E15 year-round. As you know, the consideration of state action has led to a historic agreement between liquid fuel stakeholders in support of securing a permanent legislative solution to allow nationwide, year-round E15 sales, while respecting each state’s authority to opt-out of such a program. Taking temporary action now will continue the uninterrupted sale of E15 for what would be the sixth consecutive year, a major win for consumer choice and emissions reductions.Lastly, extending the nationwide sale of E15 could again add billions of gallons of ethanol to the fuel supply at a time domestic inventories of crude oil and petroleum products are at their lowest point since May 2004, below when the EPA issued its 2022 and 2023 waivers. Furthermore, additional decreases in OPEC oil production will only amplify the already robust market for U.S. exports at a time of rising fuel demand.American biofuels remain a straightforward, no-cost solution to shoring up our energy supply and reducing consumer costs, and issuing a waiver for the 2024 summer driving season remains in the public’s best interest. Thank you for your swift consideration of this request.Sincerely, Permalink: https://www.fischer.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2024/4/fischer-colleagues-urge-biden-to-prioritize-e15-fuel-leverage-american-agriculture 20 West 23rd StreetKearney, NE 68847Phone: (308) 234-2361Fax: (308) 234-3684 120 East 16th StreetSuite 203Scottsbluff, NE 69361Phone: (308) 630-2329Fax: (308) 630-2321 Pursuant to Senate Policy, petitions, opinion polls and unsolicited mass electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60-day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election.

       " \"At a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing this week, U.S. Senator Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) questioned U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Tom Vilsack about the department’s efforts to promote broadband access in rural and unserved areas.In 2021, Senator Fischer\\xa0secured\\xa0an\\xa0amendment\\xa0in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law directing the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to create a publicly accessible online mapping tool for broadband infrastructure deployment. This tool helps federal agencies like USDA to avoid duplication and efficiently deploy broadband networks across America.\\xa0During her remarks, Senator Fischer also discussed her work to\\xa0secure\\xa0$25 million for the construction of a USDA Agricultural Research Service facility which will be co-located at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln’s Innovation Campus.Senator Fischer also highlighted advancements from the USDA’s Meat Animal Research Center in Clay Center, Nebraska, that support the state and country’s livestock industry.\\xa0\\xa0  Click the image above to watch a video of Sen. Fischer’s questioningClick here\\xa0to download audioClick here\\xa0to download video \\xa0 On Supporting Precision Agriculture Technology Research:Senator Fischer:\\xa0In FY24, I was glad to secure $25 million toward USDA’s ARS NationalCenter for Resilient and Regenerative Precision Agriculture to be co-located at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. And I'm excited that we will be holding a groundbreaking in a few weeks alongside some of your leadership at USDA. And I look forward to continuing to work with USDA on that facility and to advance that very important technology.On the Need to Expand Broadband Access:Senator Fischer:\\xa0I believe it's important to maximize the funding that broadband programs are receiving and to get broadband to unserved areas. In order to do that, I think it would make sense that we have one data source that we can rely on, about where broadband is and where it is not.Can you share how the USDA has tried to promote a more consistent challenge process comparing what is used by Rural Utility Service versus what is used by the FCC, in connection with the National Broadband Map?\\xa0And has USDA considered measures to improve transparency for challenges by publishing written reason decisions\\xa0on those challenges?Secretary Vilsack:\\xa0When we received the resource under the bipartisan infrastructure law, the White House convened the FCC, the Department of Commerce, and the USDA, and expressed a concern for collaboration and cooperation between the three entities. We made the decision that we would try to get our resources out under the ReConnect Program as quickly as possible, which we have. We've obligated those resources.We will continue to make announcements for the rest of this year, but roughly 320 projects will be funded. And the location and the scope and the nature of those projects was provided to the FCC and the Department of Commerce. So, they in turn could take that into consideration as they made decisions concerning the allocation of a far greater amount of money that they received that they, in turn, provide to the states, to encourage the states then to make the necessary changes to ensure that we do, in fact, ultimately have access to decent broadband everywhere in the country.On the Importance of Agricultural Research:Senator Fischer:\\xa0I also want to discuss the USDA Meat Animal Research Center (USMARC) at Clay Center, Nebraska. As you know, livestock is the largest segment for agriculture in Nebraska. I was glad to see the budget request included a request for additional employees at USMARC in Clay Center.\\xa0Your ARS budget request also highlighted some of the important advancements that USMARC has accomplished, such as a development that could protect cattle from BVD, which is estimated to cause annual losses of $1 billion in the United States alone.\\xa0So, Mr. Secretary, could you discuss how that increased staff at USMARC can help carry out research related to critical livestock industry priorities, including increased environmental sustainability, improved production efficiencies, and optimized use of natural resources?Secretary Vilsack:\\xa0I think the easiest way to answer that question — we will approach these challenges in the same way we approach all challenges relative to agriculture, and that is in a cooperative and\\xa0collaborative way, working\\xa0not just with the university, but also working with those who are directly impacted and affected by the research. Critically important to any of this is the cooperation of producers. And producers are in the best position to inform us as to where they think priorities should be. And we should be responsive to those priorities. And the research should be driven, in part, by virtue of those priorities.It should also work in concert with the research that we are independently investing in through our National Institute of Food and Agriculture, as well as the private foundation that was established in a previous Farm Bill so that we have a comprehensive approach, a coordinated approach so that we're not basically spending $2 when $1 will do. So, I think it's a collaborative approach. It’s a cooperative approach, and it's a comprehensive approach.

       " 'Restoring American Deterrence Act Based on Key Recommendations from the Strategic Posture Commission“We Need to Take Action Today” WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and Ranking Member of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, introduced the Restoring American Deterrence Act. The legislation is cosponsored by U.S. Senators Angus King (I-Maine), Chair of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, and Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Ranking Member of the Armed Services Committee.The comprehensive, bipartisan legislation would overhaul U.S. nuclear preparedness and enact key updates to America’s strategic posture. The Restoring American Deterrence Act contains multiple provisions aimed at ensuring that the U.S. can continue to deter China and Russia into the future.The legislation is based on\\xa0recommendations\\xa0from the Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States.\\xa0“We need to take action today to meet the threats of tomorrow. Our current strategy is based on flawed, outdated assumptions from 2010 that will not be enough to effectively deter our peer nuclear adversaries\\xa0like\\xa0China and Russia in the future. The bipartisan Restoring American Deterrence Act is the landmark solution we need. Our legislation lays a solid foundation for the Departments of Defense and Energy to maintain a safe, reliable, and credible deterrent for decades to come,”\\xa0said Senator Fischer.Background:Last year, the bipartisan Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States released its comprehensive\\xa0report, which includes a review of the current and projected threat environment; an assessment of America’s current nuclear weapons policies; and key recommendations to update our strategic posture and nuclear weapons strategy.\\xa0The report concluded that the U.S. is on the cusp of having two nuclear peer adversaries – for the first time in history – in China and Russia and noted that both seek to change the international status quo, by force, if necessary. The Commissioners wrote: “It is an existential challenge for which the United States is ill-prepared, unless its leaders make decisions now to adjust the U.S. strategic posture.”In October, Senators Fischer and King released a\\xa0joint statement\\xa0praising the report.\\xa0Click here\\xa0to view text of the legislation.\\xa0Legislation:Senator Fischer’s Restoring American Deterrence Act includes multiple provisions based on the Commission’s recommendations, including:\\xa0 Permalink: https://www.fischer.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2024/4/fischer-king-wicker-introduce-bill-to-overhaul-american-nuclear-preparedness-address-future-threats-from-china-and-russia 20 West 23rd StreetKearney, NE 68847Phone: (308) 234-2361Fax: (308) 234-3684 120 East 16th StreetSuite 203Scottsbluff, NE 69361Phone: (308) 630-2329Fax: (308) 630-2321 Pursuant to Senate Policy, petitions, opinion polls and unsolicited mass electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60-day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election.

       " \"This week, U.S. Senator Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, questioned National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Administrator Jill Hruby about the agency’s efforts to modernize America’s nuclear deterrent and the importance of ending the boom-and-bust cycle of production.At the hearing, Senator Fischer pressed Administrator Hruby about the need to build a strong foundation to address America’s long-term strategic threats, including through deeper collaboration between NNSA and U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM).Senator Fischer also discussed her\\xa0support\\xa0for the Sea-Launched Cruise Missile (SLCM) program and NNSA’s efforts to accelerate delivery of the warhead. In the FY 24 National Defense Authorization Act, Senator Fischer\\xa0secured language\\xa0to create a program of record for SLCM. Click the image above to watch a video of Sen. Fischer’s questioningClick here\\xa0to download audioClick here\\xa0to download video \\xa0 On NNSA’s Critical Role in America’s Nuclear Deterrence Strategy:Senator Fischer:\\xa0Nuclear deterrence is the backbone of our national security. It underpins every operational plan that we have and every administration since the 1960s has validated the need for our nuclear triad. While the Air Force and the Navy are responsible for the bombers, ICBMs, missiles, and submarines, it is the NNSA and the Department of Energy who are responsible for the designing, manufacturing, and certifying of the nuclear weapons themselves. Transitioning back towards a production mindset has its challenges, but I understand NNSA delivered over 200 modernized nuclear weapons last year. And I'm glad to see that progress is being made and that NNSA is reprioritizing the production and delivery of nuclear weapons. Administrator, how would this budget request help NNSA to meet their requirement to increase the number of modernized nuclear weapons produced and delivered in FY25 and beyond?Administrator Hruby:\\xa0Thank you, Senator Fischer. We appreciate your recognizing that we have made significant accomplishments. This budget request for FY25 has actually more money for production modernization than it has for stockpile modernization in it; that's not because we're not doing stockpile modernization — we're very focused on that — but we recognize to meet the demands over the next decade and beyond, we really have to get after our production enterprise. And in particular, a lot of the emphasis is on making sure we can bring up production at both Los Alamos and Savannah River, complete the Uranium Processing Facility and other high priorities in the system. So I think that the most important thing that NNSA can do to secure the future for the nuclear enterprise is to develop success like we are in modernizing weapons, and then modernize our infrastructure.On Preparing For Long-Term Threats, Ending the Boom and Bust Cycle of Production:Senator Fischer:\\xa0When we visited before this hearing, we talked about balancing those seven modernization programs, and how we really can't afford any further delays on any of those. To avoid similar boom and bust cycles in the future we have to have that groundwork laid now, the foundation laid now. Can you tell me how NNSA is working with STRATCOM to assess future threats in the late 2030s and beyond, to be able to identify the likely requirements for future nuclear weapons programs?Administrator Hruby:\\xa0Yes, Senator, thank you. This is one of the things I'm very proud to say that we've made a significant progress working with General Cotton. We have agreed that we really need to define those needs beyond the mid 2030s, which is where the program of record today ends; we've got seven things going on between now and the mid-2030s, but we know we have needs beyond that. And we've reestablished a process that used to exist -- it had gone quiet -- to have STRATCOM staff, who understand and think about deterrence needs on a daily basis, to work with our staff, who think about and understand capabilities on a daily basis. To work together more closely on and to meet regularly to define, what is the gap? And what's the best way to fill it that will exist in the late 2030s and 2040s.On the Need for the Fischer-Backed Sea-Launched Cruise Missile Program:Senator Fischer:\\xa0You know, I've really appreciated our discussions on how we can accelerate the delivery of SLCM. And I've appreciated that you have that request in the unfunded priority list for $70 million for SLCM. I think that does demonstrate a really clear commitment to meeting the requirements that are now set in law. Administrator, can you provide us with an update on how the NNSA is moving forward with the development of the warhead.Administrator Hruby:\\xa0Yes, we are looking, working very closely with the Navy as they define their delivery platform, to define the warhead that will match well to that. Our objective because we're trying to do this and in the program of record, we're trying to squeeze it between some programs that we are already working on, is to find the most effective and simplest way that won't disrupt the rest of the program of record to meet the requirements for SLCM-N. So we're looking at the W80-4, as was in the authorizing language; we're also looking at other\\xa0options that might — we don't know yet\\xa0— be simpler to do in terms of disrupting our current production flow.

       " \"Attorney General Merrick Garland: “I’m Sorry, and Maybe Even Embarrassed, to Say that I’m Not Sufficiently Familiar with the RISS Program.” At a Senate Appropriations hearing\\xa0this week, U.S. Senator Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) questioned U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland about the failures of President Biden’s FY25 budget request.Senator Fischer questioned the Attorney General about proposed\\xa0cuts to the Regional\\xa0Information Sharing Systems (RISS) Program, which offers secure information sharing, communications capabilities, and other support services\\xa0for local, state, and federal law enforcement\\xa0to enhance officer safety and fight violent crime.Senator Fischer also asked about the administration’s effort to defund the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP), which helps states and localities imprison criminal illegal aliens – resources that are critical amid the ongoing crisis at the U.S. southern border. Senator Fischer is committed to ensuring that states have the resources they need to grapple with the damaging impacts of President Biden’s catch and release policies. Click the image above to watch a video of Sen. Fischer’s questioningClick here\\xa0to download audioClick here\\xa0to download video On President Biden’s Proposed Cuts to Local Law Enforcement Programs:Senator Fischer:\\xa0President Biden's budget request for the Justice Department states that its goal is to uphold the rule of law. I appreciate this goal, but I don't see a budget that truly supports this vision. I see cuts to resources for local law enforcement who are struggling right now. I see the elimination of a program that helps put criminal illegal aliens in jail. And I'm seeing cuts like these in favor of more spending to fulfill President Biden's political goals. Smart and responsible budget cuts are important, but if you really want to uphold the law, cuts to law enforcement programs aren't the right place to start.On the Benefits of the Regional Information Sharing Systems (RISS) Program:Senator Fischer:\\xa0Your funding request for the Community Based Violence Intervention and Prevention Initiative is $110 million more than the funding you're seeking for the Regional Information Sharing Systems program, known as RISS. RISS is a proven communications program that helps state and local law enforcement combat criminal activity. As nice as community intervention programs are, they'll never replace the men and women in uniform who hold the thin blue line every single day. The President's request actually tries to cut funding for the RISS program by several million dollars. Did the department assess a reduced need for RISS funding for FY 25? Because that's not what I'm hearing from Nebraska sheriffs.Attorney General Garland:\\xa0I have to say that funding for state and local police is a high priority for the Justice Department. We're asking for more than $4.3 billion in funding for state and local police, and $16.5 billion dollars in a mandatory program over five years. We're asking for an increase in our COPS hiring program of 893.5%, $2.5 billion total, $2.3 billion increase. That money goes for state and local police hiring. We're asking for $524.5 million for Byrne JAG grants. $323 million, a $7.5 million increase, for our Office of Violence Against Women grants which focus on local law enforcement and prosecutors. We've asked for $133 million for our Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program.On President Biden’s Proposed Cuts to the RISS Program:Senator Fischer:\\xa0I know — Excuse me. I have limited time. But, I know there are a number of programs out there. But, specifically to the RISS program, which is a program that really offers secure information sharing and communications capabilities, investigative support services. And that all enhances our officers' safety. And so what I'm hearing is the priority for that program, which we're looking at a $4 million decrease and the President's requesting $40 million. You compare that to the Community Based Violence Intervention Prevention Initiative … why are we looking at, in the FY 24 budget, $0 for that program? We're now looking at a $150 million increase in that program. So, I'm just curious. If you reach out to local law enforcement, which I know you do, but do you hear a priority being for the RISS program as well?Attorney General Garland:\\xa0I'm sorry, and maybe even embarrassed to say that I'm not sufficiently familiar with the RISS program. I have spoken constantly. We meet quarterly with state and local law enforcement. And I've gone to more than 40 U.S. Attorney's Offices to meet with state and local. This issue hasn't been raised for me, but I will ask my staff to get back to you. Many of the things we're talking about sound like things that are also covered by the other grant programs, but—On President Biden’s Push to Defund Programs Combating Crime from Illegal Immigration:Senator Fischer:\\xa0We also face issues because of the chaos that we see at our southern border. There's a program that you have there. It's one of the few programs that helps states with that. It's the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, which the President has proposed to cut funding to that entirely, entirely. The reason being that it's a duplicative program. My time is out, but I'd like to submit a couple more questions to you if you could respond to it. And, specifically, that program because we are seeing across this country, cities, states seeing increased needs for these assistance programs because of the chaos that we see at our border. And, to find one that, again, is working for my state, and to see that being cut, I'd like to explore the answers that you provide for that.

       " \"WASHINGTON, D.C. – \\xa0Today, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, held a hearing with authors of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Organization Designation Authorization (ODA) Expert Review Panel’s final report on Boeing’s safety culture. At the hearing, Sen. Cantwell stressed the need for Boeing to take serious steps to strengthen its safety management system (SMS) and safety culture and emphasized that the expert panel’s recommendations provide a clear road map for future aviation safety reform legislation. “The expert panel’s 53 recommendations regarding Boeing’s ODA, Safety Management System and safety culture serve as an important catalyst for future aviation safety legislation,” Sen. Cantwell said at the opening of the hearing. “While we have made safety improvements through the aircraft certification reform law—and some of that is still playing out with the new Administrator who I think is more aggressively taking the responsibilities of the Act seriously—we look to build on those advancements with a 5-year FAA reauthorization bill and some enhanced safety features. But we’re not going to stop there. There is more to be done to implement the recommendations from your report.”  “Although the final report gave Boeing 6 months to make this action plan a reality, the expert panel’s recommendations, the FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker has cut this to 90 days,” Sen. Cantwell continued. “I expect the company to comply with this deadline and submit a serious plan that demonstrates the commitment to these kind of safety measures. The FAA must also demonstrate that it is going to be a strong regulator on these issues.” Today’s witnesses included Dr. Javier de Luis, Aeronautics and Astronautics Lecturer at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), who lost his sister in the 2019 Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 737 MAX crash; Dr. Tracy Dillinger, Manager for Safety Culture and Human Factors at NASA; and Dr. Najmedin Meshkati, Aviation Safety Professor at University of Southern California. The landmark Aircraft Certification, Safety, and Accountability Act (ACSAA), authored and championed by Sen. Cantwell, required the FAA to convene the independent expert panel comprised of aviation safety experts to review the effectiveness of Boeing and other manufacturers’ safety management systems, their ability to foster a strong safety culture, and whether they make sound organizational and delegation decisions prioritizing aviation safety. About the report: Over the course of a year, the 24-member Expert Review Panel reviewed more than 4,000 pages of Boeing documents, conducted seven surveys, and completed over 250 interviews and meetings with Boeing employees across six company locations. The panel’s final report made 53 recommendations to improve safety deficiencies and found a disconnect within the company’s safety culture between senior management and the workforce and that Boeing’s SMS safety procedures were not structured in a way to ensure all employees understand safety procedures. Sen. Cantwell expressed her concern that employees are unable to have their concerns heard and acted upon, asking the witnesses, “how do we ensure that those who are speaking up about safety measures get listened to?”  “Well, in a properly functioning SMS and a properly functioning safety culture, those questions wouldn’t be asked,” Dr. Javier de Luis responded. “Because people would be empowered, people would have confidence that they wouldn’t be smacked down if they spoke up.” “[O]ne of our recommendations, we recommended that Boeing establish what are called ASAP programs, Aviation Safety Action Programs. They’re very common in airlines, and an ASAP program is a tripartite program. It has the FAA, the labor, and management, and if you initiate an ASAP event, you’re protected. But more importantly than being protected, the event gets visibility at the FAA level, as well as the management level.” Sen. Cantwell also asked Dr. Meshkati how human factors impact safety culture: “The report states that during the development of the 757 and 767, human factors in the flight deck operations “were the gold standard,” in part because “human factors specialists worked closely and collectively in Seattle,” said Sen. Cantwell. “Then the report goes on to say, “the role of human factors and its influence eroded through a series of administration issues, including reorganization, decentralization, downsizing, and relocation of the company's headquarters.” “Human factors works very good when you're very close to engineers and system designers. They exchange information, they've worked together, they work on the design of the system, and then they work on the training and that, and then they solve that problem together,” responded Dr. Meshkati. In a later exchange, Sen. Cantwell asked Dr. Javier de Luis about what steps the FAA, as the safety oversight regulator, should take to improve its own safety system. “We focused a lot about, especially since January 5, on the need to put more FAA boots on the ground in the factory,” Dr. Javier de Luis responded. “I keep going back to something that was said earlier, about the need for the FAA to really step up its own SMS. I think that's critical. If you have that, then you have a chance of being able to appropriately interface with the people you're supposed to regulate.” Transcripts of Sen.

       " 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – \\xa0Today, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, joined a press conference with Senators Ed Markey (D-MA) and Ron Wyden (D-OR), Representative Anna Eshoo (D-CA-16), and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chair Jessica Rosenworcel, in Washington, D.C., on the upcoming FCC rule reclassifying broadband as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Communications Act and reinstating net neutrality protections. The Commission will vote on the final rule at its open meeting on April 25. \"The State of Washington has the fifth-highest share of remote workers in the country and the highest concentration of tech workers, so they rely on safeguarding for small businesses the ability to compete online,\" Sen. Cantwell said. \"We need to protect the growing innovation economy by making sure that we have rules that say you can’t throttle, you can’t slow down, and you can’t charge exorbitant fees just to have preferential treatment.\" “Survey after survey show that 80% of the public support’s the FCC’s Net Neutrality rules and oppose their repeal. So bringing back the FCC’s authority over broadband, and putting back in place Net Neutrality rules is popular,” said FCC Chair Rosenworcel. “It’s also been court tested, and court approved. It’s good for consumers who count on broadband like never before. It’s important for public safety, it’s important for national security, and when the FCC votes next week, we have the opportunity to get this right.”  As Chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Sen. Cantwell has consistently championed legislation to support a free and open internet. In June 2023, Sen. Cantwell chaired the nomination hearing of Anna Gomez for FCC Commissioner, and advanced her nomination a month later. Gomez was confirmed by a Senate vote of 55-43 in September 2023, restoring a Democratic majority on the FCC. In January 2017, Sen. Cantwell voted against Trump’s nominee for Chairman of the FCC, Ajit Pai, due to his opposition to net neutrality rules. After Pai\\'s confirmation, Sen. Cantwell sent several letters to the FCC opposing their vote to weaken net neutrality rules and introduced a bipartisan\\xa0Congressional Review Act (CRA) joint resolution\\xa0to reverse the rollback of net neutrality. Following the FCC\\'s repeal of net neutrality rules, Sen. Cantwell cosponsored the 2019\\xa0Save the Internet Act\\xa0, and the\\xa0Net Neutrality and Broadband Justice Act in 2022. In 2006, Sen. Cantwell cosponsored a bipartisan amendment to the\\xa0COPE Act\\xa0to enshrine net neutrality into federal law. Video of Sen.

       " 'WASHINGTON, D.C. –\\xa0Yesterday, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, joined Senators Todd Young (R-IN), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), in introducing the Future of AI Innovation Act, which lays the foundation to maintain U.S. leadership in the global race to develop artificial intelligence (AI) and other emerging technologies. “Our bill ensures the United States will lead on AI for decades to come. It promotes public-private collaboration to drive innovation and competitiveness. The NIST AI Safety Institute, testbeds at our national labs, and the grand challenge prizes will bring together private sector and government experts to develop standards, create new assessment tools, and overcome existing barriers. It will lay a strong foundation for America’s evolving AI tech economy for years to come,” said Sen. Maria Cantwell.  The legislation promotes strong partnerships between government, business, civil society, and academia to advance AI research. It authorizes the U.S. AI Safety Institute at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to promote the development of voluntary standards and creates testbeds with national labs to accelerate groundbreaking AI innovation for the benefit of future economic growth and national security. As foreign adversaries and competitors invest heavily in AI, it’s critical the U.S. maintains leadership and this bill builds on CHIPS and Science Act investments to support key private sector innovation in AI. This legislation builds upon Sens. Cantwell and Young’s original FUTURE of AI Act, which created the National AI Advisory Committee (NAIAC), a committee of outside experts who make recommendations to the government on AI. Provisions in the Future of AI Innovation Act were drafted based on recommendations from NAIAC reports. The Future of AI Innovation Act: ###',\n",
       " \"WASHINGTON, D.C. –\\xa0This week, the U.S. Senate unanimously passed a bipartisan resolution introduced by U.S. Senators Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Todd Young (R-IN), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) to commemorate and support the goals of World Quantum Day, which is recognized annually on April 14th. The resolution highlights the importance of quantum mechanics to the technologies used in everyday life, such as semiconductors, GPS systems, and MRI imaging. The U.S. has been a pioneer in revolutionary quantum technologies and this resolution recognizes that legacy.\\xa0\\xa0 “Quantum is game-changing technology that can help solve problems faster than ever before, tackling issues from health care to agriculture. It’s important we continue to boost our STEM education programs to train students who will become the next quantum workforce changing the world,”\\xa0said Senator Cantwell. “I stand in full support of the U.S. Senate resolution to officially recognize April 14th as World Quantum Day. This resolution not only celebrates the United States' substantial investment and pioneering leadership in quantum science but also reinforces our commitment to nurturing the diverse talent necessary to harness the transformative power of quantum technologies. Last year's resolution laid a crucial foundation, demonstrating bipartisan acknowledgment of quantum science as a pivotal frontier for innovation. Today, as we look towards the future, it is imperative that we continue to support this momentum. By fostering an inclusive environment for education and development in quantum science, we can ensure the United States remains at the forefront of this groundbreaking field, leading the world in technological advancements that promise to redefine industries, enhance national security, and solve some of our most complex challenges,”\\xa0said U.S. Representative of the World Quantum Day Initiative Spyridon Michalakis. “IBM applauds Senators Young, Hassan, Blackburn, and Cantwell for their unwavering support for World Quantum Day and their continued efforts to champion quantum policy in Congress. As an industry leader in quantum technology, we recognize the vital impact it will have on every sector of our economy and everyday life. It is essential to the growth of science and technology that we promote quantum computing science and technology worldwide,”\\xa0said IBM Fellow and Vice President of IBM Quantum Jay Gambetta. Legislative text of the resolution can be found here. As Chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Sen. Cantwell has consistently championed legislation to advance U.S. leadership in science and technology. Sen. Cantwell was the main architect and key negotiator of the CHIPS & Science Act, one of the largest five-year investments in U.S. history to spur American research and development, manufacturing, and create thousands of jobs and build a highly-trained workforce. The new law authorized a new mission at the NSF focusing on translational science in key areas – including artificial intelligence, quantum technology, advanced manufacturing, composites, energy, and biotech -- with an authorization of $20 billion over five years. Composites and advanced manufacturing are key technologies for the aviation sector. The CHIPS & Science Act additionally authorized $13 billion in STEM education funding at the NSF, representing a tripling of the NSF’s annual STEM education budget. This funding can be used for scholarships, fellowships and traineeships, and for competitive awards to universities to expand STEM education capacity. The law additionally directs the NSF to increase STEM education opportunities for women, minorities, and tribal communities, directing nearly $2 billion to minority-serving institutions and other emerging research institutions around the country with a proven track record of helping grow a diverse workforce. One of the major focuses of the CHIPS & Science Act was enabling smaller institutions to compete for NSF grants, and programs like Growing Research Access for Nationally Transformative Equity and Diversity (GRANTED) assist emerging institutions seeking to work with the NSF. ###\",\n",

WASHINGTON\\xa0– U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) today delivered a speech on the U.S. Senate floor demanding Congress take action to ensure the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) remains affordable, particularly in the wake of flooding across Louisiana last week. “Last week, we saw terrible flooding in parts of Louisiana,”\\xa0said Dr. Cassidy.\\xa0“Now, families in Louisiana are turning to FEMA and the National Flood Insurance Program to help lift them out of the hole that last week’s storms have left them in. Moments like this are why families have flood insurance.” “NFIP\\xa0premiums in Louisiana are expected to go up by 234%, with some zip codes increasing as much as 1,100%. In real terms, some zip codes will see an increase from around 600 dollars to more than eight thousand dollars annually,”\\xa0said Dr. Cassidy.\\xa0“Insurance—just like everything else in this country—has become unaffordable.” Background Last month, Cassidy\\xa0delivered\\xa0a speech on the Senate floor highlighting how important flood insurance is across the United States. He urged Congress to take action to protect the 4.7 million American homes that rely on\\xa0NFIP\\xa0to rebuild after a flood. In January, the U.S. Senate Banking Committee\\xa0held\\xa0a hearing on\\xa0NFIP\\xa0at the request of Cassidy. The hearing\\xa0highlighted\\xa0the urgent need for Congress to act and\\xa0featured\\xa0a Louisiana witness. Last year, Cassidy\\xa0reintroduced his National Flood Insurance Program Reauthorization Act\\xa0to reauthorize the program for five years, providing greater stability for homeowners, small business owners, and the real estate market as the nation continues to struggle with inflationary pressures. The bill would also implement a series of sweeping reforms to reduce costs, make generational investments in communities to reduce flood risk, and establish a fairer claims process for policyholders. He\\xa0participated\\xa0in a roundtable hosted by GNO, Inc. and the Coalition for Sustainable Flood Insurance before introducing the bill to hear from community leaders and advocates on the issue. Cassidy also\\xa0traveled St. Bernard Parish\\xa0last August to talk with residents about their flood insurance premiums, resulting in the second episode of his series\\xa0Bill on the Hill. Last February, Cassidy\\xa0delivered\\xa0a speech on the U.S. Senate floor demanding the Biden administration halt massive hikes to National Flood Insurance Program premiums caused by Risk Rating 2.0. He continues to call out President Biden—who can stop the implementation of Risk Rating 2.0 with the stroke of his pen.

Cassidy’s full speech as prepared for delivery can be found below: Madame President,\\xa0 Last week, we saw terrible flooding in parts of Louisiana. People’s lives were disrupted, just like after any serious flooding. Now, families in Louisiana are turning to FEMA and the National Flood Insurance Program to help lift them out of the hole that last week’s storms have left them in. Moments like this are why families have flood insurance.\\xa0 But what about after we’ve recovered and the sun is shining again? There is an increasing concern amongst Louisianans and Americans that they will not be able to afford to keep their flood insurance for when the next storm hits. A house is the biggest purchase most people make in their lifetime. Unless you are among the wealthiest Americans, you are taking out a mortgage to make that purchase. After you’ve bought your home, imagine if FEMA changes the rules, and your flood insurance now costs more than that mortgage. No American should have to pay more in flood insurance than their mortgage. But that is the story I am hearing more frequently from people in Louisiana. There is a cost-of-living crisis in Louisiana that is being fueled by inflation created by the Biden administration. Inflation is costing Louisiana families 884 dollars more a month compared to 2021. Everywhere they turn, they are frustrated with the fact they’re paying more and getting less. When I speak to families back in my state, they are not only worried about how they are going to put food on their table or pay for gas. They are worried about how they are going to afford to stay in their homes. How can they afford a good education for their children? Congress has the power to do something about it, and I want to focus on making flood insurance affordable.\\xa0 The National Flood Insurance Program was created as a safety net for the most vulnerable Americans. It covers 4.7 million American homes.\\xa0 But those millions of homes are at risk of losing their protection because of skyrocketing premiums caused by FEMA’s new risk assessment system, Risk Rating 2.0. Let’s talk briefly about the history of\\xa0NFIP, Risk Rating 2.0, and how we got here. FEMA introduced Risk Rating 2.0 in October of 2021, and it was slated to take effect in 2022 for new policies and in 2023 for existing policyholders. Since then, Americans who rely on flood insurance have been held in a state of uncertainty. Before they were hit with that first bill, many families didn’t know if their premiums would jump up, how much they would increase, and when the rate hikes would end. FEMA told us that 77 percent of policyholders would see a premium hike, but they refused to tell us how the agency calculates individual policy rates. FEMA is hitting Americans with a bill and won’t tell Congress—the people elected to represent them—how they came up with the price? If I sound frustrated, that’s because I am.\\xa0 You wouldn’t accept if your mechanic stuck you with a crazy bill but wouldn’t tell you what was wrong with your car. Why would we just accept it from a government agency that exists to serve the people? Louisiana is one of the states getting hit the hardest. NFIP\\xa0premiums in Louisiana are expected to go up by 234 percent, with some zip codes increasing as much as 11 hundred percent (1,100%). In real terms, some zip codes will see an increase from around 600 dollars to more than eight thousand dollars annually. Couple that with the homeowner’s insurance crisis in my state, couple that with inflation across the country, couple that with the cost to heat your home and the cost to go to the grocery store, it’s clear to see why Americans feel like they can’t keep their head above water.\\xa0 Insurance—just like everything else in this country—has become unaffordable. And when people can’t afford flood insurance, they begin to drop their coverage, and the pool of policyholders shrinks. It enters what’s called an actuarial death spiral.\\xa0 FEMA itself forecasted that over 20 percent of policyholders would leave the program within 10 years. We are setting the program up for collapse and leaving Americans who need insurance out in the cold. And some groups are being hit even harder than others. While FEMA won’t tell us how they come up with the numbers they expect Americans to pay, we do know that they do not factor in income—or ability to pay. There is no discount or consideration for working-class families who live paycheck to paycheck. Or the elderly couple who are retired and live on a fixed income. Congress has the power to reverse this trend. We need to step up now. If my colleagues and my friends in the other chamber want to honor the people we serve, let’s start with the 4.7 million policyholders being mistreated by the National Flood Insurance program. I urge my colleagues to read our\\xa0NFIP\\xa0Reauthorization and Reform Act—come talk to me about it. We can only move forward by working together.\\xa0 With that, I yield back. ###',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON\\xa0– U.S. Senators Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) and Ed Markey (D-MA) today announced new cosponsors and organizational support for their bipartisan, bicameral\\xa0Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA 2.0).\\xa0 Along with Senators Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and Ted Cruz (R-TX), the Chair and Ranking Member of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, who\\xa0cosponsored COPPA 2.0 in February, the following senators are new cosponsors of the legislation: Senators Laphonza Butler (D-CA), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Angus King (I-ME), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Gary Peters (D-MI), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Peter Welch (D-VT), and Ron Wyden (D-OR). “With COPPA 2.0 introduced in the House and new cosponsors in the Senate, momentum is quickly building for our critical legislation to protect children and teens’ online privacy,”\\xa0said the senators.\\xa0“We must put an end to the pervasive online tracking and targeting of our young people. We thank our colleagues for the support of COPPA 2.0 and are committed to enacting these essential protections into law.” “I am deeply concerned by the way our children are tracked online,”\\xa0said Senator Butler. “If we cannot rely on Big Tech companies to make good on their commitment to prioritize children’s privacy over profits, we need to legislate them into action and make crystal clear the urgent need for reform.” “All individuals, including children, are the rightful owners of their personal information. They should be granted a certain set of privacy rights and the ability to protect those rights. This legislation safeguards the data of America’s kids and prevents targeted ads, protecting our children as they navigate an increasingly digital world,”\\xa0said Senator Crapo.\\xa0 “As the online environment evolves, it’s critical that we update how we protect our children from consuming online content that could be detrimental to their development and safety,”\\xa0said Senator King. “The bipartisan, bicameral Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act will ensure that our children are guarded from pervasive tracking and targeting, often used by companies or bad actors looking to manipulate our young family members. Maine has a strong tradition of supporting digital literacy and learning, and this bill will act as a backstop for the online safety of our children.” “Despite the dangers our kids are exposed to online, it’s been more than 25 years since Congress passed any legislation regulating the Internet,”\\xa0said Senator Klobuchar. “This critical legislation will bring much-needed updates to our data privacy laws, empowering parents and young people to control how their data is collected and used.” “I’m proud to join my colleagues in supporting this legislation that updates the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act to better protect our teens and kids online,”\\xa0said Senator Luján. “Our country has a responsibility to put them in a position for success. That’s why I’m supporting this bipartisan solution that better protects youth by preventing harmful data collection practices while holding tech companies accountable.” “The bipartisan, bicameral Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act is crucial to protecting the safety of our young people online,”\\xa0said Senator Manchin. “We must protect our country’s youth from the dangers of social media and invasive data collection and I’m pleased that support for the bill is growing. I will continue working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to advance this important, commonsense legislation to keep our children and teens safe on the Internet.” “Social media companies are making billions of dollars every year from ads targeted at teens in the United States. So it’s no wonder why they have no appetite to change their business model on their own. It’s working for them – just not for the millions of young kids who are sad and lonely and angry because of it. These kids need help. And because the companies have shown time and again that they won’t step up, Congress must instead,”\\xa0said Senator Schatz.\\xa0 “Our children’s lives are increasingly integrated with the internet, from completing homework to connecting with friends. As our kids and grandkids spend more time online, ensuring they are protected from harm is a shared priority—whether you’re in a red state or blue state. This bill will enact crucial protections to help safeguard children and teens’ online privacy,”\\xa0said Senator Welch.\\xa0 “I’ve said for years that forcing companies to protect the privacy of kids, teens, and all Americans is the single best thing Congress can do to make the internet safer and more trustworthy. For this reason, I strongly support Senator Markey’s COPPA 2.0. It’s beyond time that we limited the data companies can collect on teens. This is the best way to curb companies’ ability to target minors with ads and harmful content,”\\xa0said Senator Wyden. New organizations supporting COPPA 2.0 include the AASA, The School Superintendents Association, American Federation of Teachers, Association of Educational Service Agencies, Association of School Business Officials International (ASBO), Consortium for School Networking, Council of the Great City Schools, National Association for Pupil Transportation, National Education Association, National Rural Education Association, National School Boards Association, Public Interest Privacy Center, and Public Knowledge.\\xa0 “AASA is proud to support COPPA 2.0. We commend Senators Markey and Cassidy for their tireless work on the Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act, and are pleased to see today’s legislation balance two critical priorities: supporting the incorporation of education technology into education to promote learning and success for students and ensuring student data privacy. We look forward to continuing to work with Congress to ensure COPPA 2.0 maintains its enhanced privacy protections for children and teens online, and that these protections do not have unintended consequences for our nation’s schools,”\\xa0said Dr. David R. Schuler, Executive Director of AASA, The School Superintendents Association. “The Public Interest Privacy Center (PIPC) is proud to support the updated version of COPPA 2.0 and its codification of long-standing administrative policy allowing schools to consent to educational technology uses. COPPA 2.0 finds the right balance between protecting child and teen privacy online while allowing schools to provide appropriate, technology-enhanced educational opportunities to all students,”\\xa0said Amelia Vance, President of Public Interest Privacy Center.\\xa0 Last week, Representatives Tim Walberg (R-MI-05) and Kathy Castor (D-FL-14)\\xa0introduced\\xa0the House companion to COPPA 2.0. In July 2023, the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee unanimously\\u202fpassed\\u202fCOPPA 2.0. ###',\n",

Higher reporting and compliance costs are the last thing they need in this economy.” “The SEC’s final climate disclosure rule threatens economic opportunity across the country, and it must be overturned. Over and over again, SEC Chair Gensler has disregarded the real-world impacts of his aggressive regulatory agenda in his dogged pursuit of left-wing political priorities. This rule is no exception. The SEC’s mission is to regulate our capital markets and ensure all Americans can safely share in their economic success – not to force a partisan climate agenda on American businesses. This rule is federal overreach at its worst, and the SEC should stay in its lane,”\\xa0said Senator Scott. Cassidy and Scott were joined by every Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, including U.S. Senators Mike Crapo (R-ID), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Thom Tillis (R-NC), John Kennedy (R-LA), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), J.D.

Background Cassidy has been\\xa0vocal\\xa0in\\xa0pushing back\\xa0against the SEC’s climate disclosure rule. The rule exceeds the SEC’s mission, expertise, and authority and – if finalized in any form – will unnecessarily harm consumers, workers, and the U.S. economy. Under Chair Gary Gensler, the SEC has pursued one of the most aggressive regulatory agendas in the agency’s history – with the agency on track to propose and finalize over 60 rules with limited public comment periods and inadequate cost-benefit analyses. Through rigorous congressional oversight, Senate Republicans have continued to push back on the widespread impact and confusion created by the agency’s proposed rules on our capital markets, American retirement savers, and businesses of all sizes. ###',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON\\xa0– U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) advocated for Louisiana shrimpers and rice producers at a U.S. Senate Finance Committee hearing with U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Ambassador Katherine Tai. He once again asked about progress being made to prevent the “dumping” of shrimp and rice from India. Because the Indian shrimp and rice industries are highly subsidized, Indian producers can sell their products at a much lower rate than American producers, a trade practice known as “dumping.” This practice hurts American shrimp and rice producers, especially in Louisiana, who are unable to compete. Cassidy also highlighted a\\xa0recent whistleblower report on the safety of shrimp imported from India.\\xa0 “My shrimpers are saying, ‘My gosh, if I have to go to court to make this happen, I’m going to be out of business before there’s actually relief.’ So if you were speaking directly to my shrimpers, who are being put out of business by labor abuses and subsidies, how do you reassure them that this issue is going to be taken care of?”\\xa0asked Dr. Cassidy.\\xa0 Ambassador Tai recognized Cassidy’s continued leadership on this issue. “This has been literally one of your highest priorities,”\\xa0responded Ambassador Tai.\\xa0“You did share with me the report on the abuses in this particular industry in India… We can prioritize the addressing of this particular issue.” “There’s also a concern from our rice [producers]. They say that if it were not for Indian subsidies of rice, they would have like roughly $850 million more in exports,”\\xa0added Dr. Cassidy.\\xa0 Ambassador Tai agreed to convene a meeting between USTR, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and Cassidy to find near-term solutions regarding the dumping of non-phytosanitary shrimp and excessive subsidies of certain industries. Cassidy closed by highlighting his\\xa0Foreign Pollution Fee Act\\xa0with U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC)—a trade policy to hold polluters accountable. Last year, the Louisiana Senate and House of Representatives unanimously adopted a\\xa0resolution\\xa0urging Congress to pursue a climate\\xa0and\\xa0trade policy.\\xa0 “We would put a tariff relative to the avoided cost of environmental compliance with international environmental norms, which would principally apply to China but also to other countries,”\\xa0explained Dr. Cassidy.\\xa0 Background Cassidy has worked to protect the Louisiana shrimp industry from unfair and harmful trade practices. Last year, Cassidy\\xa0introduced two bills\\xa0to protect Louisiana shrimp against India’s dumping of cheap shrimp and produce into U.S. markets. The Prioritizing Offensive Agricultural Disputes and Enforcement Act and the India Shrimp Tariff Act will both protect the Louisiana agricultural industry while ensuring that food that appears on U.S. store shelves meets U.S. health standards. Additionally, Cassidy\\xa0successfully pushed\\xa0the International Trade Commission to keep anti-dumping orders for frozen warmwater shrimp from India, China, Thailand, and Vietnam in place last year.\\xa0 In January, Cassidy\\xa0worked to secure\\xa0$27,152,411.00 for Louisiana fisheries, shrimpers, and fishing communities affected by natural disasters between 2017 and 2022.  ###',\n",

While the preferred projects of Republicans and Democrats may differ, the end goal is the same: build projects and create jobs in the U.S., not overseas. To address these issues constructively, Congress must modernize laws and regulations like the Clean Air Act, which is often abused. Bipartisan legislation I introduced with Senator Kyrsten Sinema (I-AZ) updates permitting without compromising public health or the environment. The Modernizing Clean Air Permitting Act ensures that the Environmental Protection Agency accounts for naturally occurring levels of things like ozone and does not require industry to lower levels below that which occurs naturally. It also incentivizes businesses to implement pollution control technology, not hinder it as in the status quo. Right now, if a company wishes to voluntarily reduce their emissions, they must obtain a new permit. That new permit could take years to obtain and cost millions of dollars. This is absurd. Our legislation repeals this backward cycle. Judicial review — the authority of courts to determine the legitimacy of federal actions — is also subject to abuse. This abuse can take the form of frivolous cases increasing the court backlog, venue shopping for an optimal outcome, or courts taking their sweet time to issue a decision. These are all means to the same end: messing with the timeline of projects to throw construction dates and costs out of whack. The Revising and Enhancing Project Authorizations Impacted by Review, or REPAIR, Act, fixes the judicial review process for U.S. energy, manufacturing, and critical infrastructure projects. For an approved permit, the REPAIR Act ensures all laws related to permitting have the same review process, scope of adjudication, standing rules, and statute of limitations. The bill also requires lawsuits to be filed under the specific statute for which the permit was issued. In the case of a judicial remand or other court action, it establishes a mediation process that allows the project developer and the permit-issuing agency to directly address the challenge to allow the project to move forward. In doing so, the judicial review process no longer acts as a delay tactic forcing projects into legal purgatory but serves as the check and balance it was always intended to be. This is the right time to get this right. Laws like the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the CHIPS and Science Act are working with U.S. companies to expand our industrial base. But these laws and investments remain stymied by a permitting and regulatory system that prevents projects from coming to fruition. Without addressing these hurdles, new investments will perpetually face frivolous lawsuits that do nothing but delay or stop projects unnecessarily. Both Democrats and Republicans acknowledge that well-intentioned laws aimed at preserving our environment are being exploited to block projects that could contribute positively to that very purpose. We must get permitting right, for the sake of progress, jobs, and environmental protection.  ###',\n",

       " \"Healthy Kids Act Sets Social Media Age Minimum, Bans Algorithmic Targeting for Users Under 17 WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawai‘i) today announced updates to his bill to protect kids from the harmful impacts of social media. In a speech on the Senate floor, Schatz discussed his Healthy Kids Act\\xa0which would set a minimum age of 13 to use social media platforms and prevent social media companies from algorithmically targeting content to users under the age of 17. The updated legislation follows extensive consultation with advocates and stakeholders, as well as Senate and Commerce Committee leadership, since Schatz first introduced legislation to protect kids online last spring. “Delaying the onset of social media use is a straightforward and common-sense way to protect our youngest kids from the very worst of the internet’s ills,” said Senator Schatz, a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. “And once kids are on social media, at 13 or 14 or whenever, they need protection, particularly from algorithmic targeting. Just last year alone, social media companies made $11 billion from ads targeted at kids under 18 in the United States. So it’s no wonder that they have no appetite to change their business model without a federal law. It’s working great for them, just not for the millions of young kids who are sad and lonely and angry because of it.” Senator Schatz continued, “I’m glad we’re seeing renewed momentum and urgency right now with a number of different proposals on this issue in the Senate. All of them, my bill included, share the same goal of keeping our kids healthy. But at the heart of this effort is the essential question of when kids ought to be on social media. At what age is it appropriate to use? If we’re going to protect these kids online – and act as a counterweight to the rich and powerful tech companies – answering that question and establishing an age minimum is essential. That’s what the Healthy Kids Act does.”  The full text of Senator Schatz’s remarks can be found below. Video is available here. Tens of millions of kids in America are anxious, depressed, angry, lonely, sedentary, sometimes insecure, sometimes suicidal. And just about everybody, whether they're parents or teachers or mental health professionals or even the kids themselves, points the finger at the same culprit: social media.  We do not need more data to tell us what is so painfully obvious in schools and homes across the country. Social media platforms, with their wildly powerful, covert, and addictive algorithms, are driving our kids deeper and deeper into a sea of despair that they can't find their way out of. Kids are being unwittingly sucked into rabbit holes that leave them in a constant state of panic and outrage, ashamed of their own bodies, lacking meaningful friendships and connections.  The idea that a young kid – a kid – can feel so unhappy and so unfulfilled at the tender age of eight or nine, so much so that they seriously contemplate self-harm, is appalling. And it is a uniquely modern crisis created over the past decades by profit-chasing tech companies for whom nothing and no one is off limits. Not even very young kids. The math for them is very simple. Attention means money, and the best way to hold people's attention is to make them upset and keep them upset.  You talk to any parent – whether they're raising a toddler or a teenager, whether they're a voter or a nonvoter, a Democrat or Republican – they are worried and they are frustrated about all the ways that social media is harming kids. But they don't know what to do about it. Or if they can do anything at all. Some might work two jobs and not have the time to monitor what their kids are up to online. Others might lack the technical literacy to operate parental controls and set limits on screen time. All they really want is for their young kids to be off social media altogether.  Because there is no good reason that a nine-year-old should be spending hours every day scrolling through TikTok that's been programed with no concern for whether the content is age appropriate or not. There is no First Amendment right for an 11-year-old to be on Instagram, while an algorithm targets them with content glorifying starvation and fueling insecurities. By the companies’ own admission, social media was never meant to be used by young kids. Yet any parent, or anyone who knows a parent, knows that young kids are on these platforms anyway. And the only way that it will stop is if the federal law finally mandates that companies keep young kids off of their services.  Over the past year, my team and I have worked extensively with a broad range of advocates and stakeholders, as well as the Senate Commerce Committee leadership, to update my bill to protect kids on social media. Our updated bill, called the Healthy Kids Act, would do two simple things. It would prevent kids under 13 from being on social media at all, and it would ban algorithmic targeting on these platforms for kids under 17. Delaying the onset of social media use is a straightforward and commonsense way to protect our youngest kids from the very worst of the internet's ills. To let them have a normal childhood in the real world. Play a sport, learn an instrument, read a book, go to the park, walk around with friends.  And once kids are on social media at 13 or 14 or whenever, they need protection, particularly from the algorithmic targeting. Just last year alone, social media companies made $11 billion from ads targeted at kids under 18 in the United States. $11 billion. So it's no wonder that they have no appetite to change their business model without a federal law. It's working great for them, just not for the millions of young kids who are sad and lonely and angry because of it.  Kids need help, and they need protection. And because the companies have shown time and time again that they will not step up, Congress must. I'm glad that we're seeing renewed momentum and urgency right now with a number of different proposals on this issue in the United States Senate. All of them, my bill included, share the same goal of keeping our kids healthy. But at the heart of this effort is an essential question of when our kids ought to be allowed to be on social media. At what age is it appropriate to use? If we're going to protect these kids online and act as a counterweight to the rich and powerful tech companies, answering that question and establishing an age minimum is essential. And that is what the Healthy Kids Act does.  It is our job here in the Senate to consider any number of difficult challenges facing the country and the world and to debate what to do about them. But what is more fundamental to the role of the federal government than to protect the most vulnerable Americans, especially our children?  If you think what's happening to kids online is unclear, look at the data. The percentage of high school students surveyed who experienced persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness in the past year [rose] from 36% to 57% for females, 21% to 29% in ten years. In ten years. It might be the phones. You can consult the data. You can ask the Surgeon General of the United States. You can ask all of the people who have studied this, and they know it is early use of social media.  Look, we all use social media, and our adult brains are not powerful enough to overcome the negative impacts. You're thirteen, you're nine, you're seven. You are going to be overpowered by these algorithms. We have to protect these kids. And if you don't believe the data, talk to any parent – Democrat or Republican, parent of a two-year-old parent of a 12-year-old. Everybody wants this tool in their tool kit. And the idea that we should pass a federal law mandating that all the social media companies have to do is have a little thing in settings where you can turn the dials on all the different aspects of your social media account is ignorant. It is ignorant. The idea that all we really need to do is precipitate a conversation between a parent and a child about social media use. No. What parents need is to be able to say, “I'm sorry, that's illegal. I'm sorry. You may not use these social media platforms.”  And I think it gets really tricky and really complicated once a kid is 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. I understand that. And we've narrowed the bill to be more precise. Because there is no First Amendment right, there is no public policy upside for a nine-year-old to be on TikTok. Nobody can make that argument with a straight face. And so as we consider our options going forward on tech policy, but specifically protecting children online, the threshold question is at what age is it appropriate for a child to use social media? If I had my druthers, I would have set it at 16, honestly. But certainly we can all agree that there is no advantage to a child's life, a prepubescent child's life, a nine-year-old, a four-year-old, an 11-year-old being on social media.  I am confident we will get this done. I'm confident that if this ever received a Senate floor vote, that it would be a resounding bipartisan majority. And I'm confident that the American people support us in this.  ###\",\n",
       " \"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawai?i), chair of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) this week led a roundtable discussion on the national housing crisis and how “Yes In My Backyard” policies and reforms can address our nation’s housing shortage. “The housing shortage didn’t happen overnight. It’s a product of decades of broken and racist housing policy – particularly zoning laws, restrictive covenants, and land use regulations that were designed to segregate Americans by race and class,” said Senator Schatz. “Fixing the housing shortage starts at an obvious place. To have more housing, we need to make it easier to build it. That means eliminating unnecessary barriers and legalizing the types and amount of housing people want and need. A lot of this work by default will happen at the state and local levels. But the federal government has a role and responsibility to help encourage reform as best we can.” “The YIMBY Act encourages localities to adopt more pro-growth zoning practices and cut through the red tape that hampers construction and increases costs,” said Senator Young. “Our overarching goal is to ensure that every American has access to decent and suitable housing. To achieve this, we must tackle the housing supply shortage that is acutely felt across the nation. This isn’t a red state or blue state issue. It isn’t a rural or urban issue. It is an issue that is affecting Americans of all income levels across the country.” “Communities across the country, including in Oregon, are facing a shortage of homes, which is driving up the cost of housing for many Americans,” said Julie Fahey, Speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives. “By collaborating on the state, local, and national level, we can continue to break down barriers to building housing with smart, equitable policies that create accessible pathways to housing for all.” “I’m gratified that Sen. Schatz and Sen. Young are placing a spotlight on the housing supply problem. Decades of under-building have led to a severe shortage of affordable homes in communities across the country. This roundtable shows how everyone can play a part in addressing the issue, especially when it comes to the availability and use of land,” said Arica Young, Associate Director of the Underserved Mortgage Markets Coalition and Innovations in Manufactured Homes Network at the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy. “I am deeply grateful to participate in Senators Schatz and Young's roundtable to discuss concrete solutions to housing supply, an issue that is a problem for communities of all sizes and types. It is a drag on economic development and influences negative health and education outcomes. This is a chance to talk about solutions!” “Our housing shortage deeply affects working and middle class Americans across the country, with people living in overcrowded, substandard housing far from where they work. Most young adults view home ownership as a pipe dream. That’s why I’m thrilled that we have champions like Senator Schatz fighting for federal policies that ease zoning restrictions and make it easier to build more housing. The Senator represents the next generation of legislators who are saying ‘yes in my backyard’ to new housing and new neighbors. The YIMBY movement is proud to be the grassroots organization fighting for these changes and working arm-in-arm with these legislators,” said Sonja Trauss, Executive Director of YIMBY Law. The discussion included the following panelists: Video of the roundtable discussion is available here. ###\",\n",
       " 'Resolution Designates April as “Preserving and Protecting Local News Month,” Highlights Importance of Local News in Democracy WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawai‘i) led a group of 14 senators in introducing a resolution designating April 2024 as “Preserving and Protecting Local News Month.” The resolution recognizes local news as a public good that serves an essential function in American democracy. “Americans rely on local news to stay informed about their communities and the country,” said Senator Schatz. “As the industry continues to face unprecedented challenges resulting in newsroom closures, layoffs, and budget cuts, it’s critical that we highlight and support the essential public service local news provides.” Overall employment in newspaper, television, radio, and digital newsrooms in the United States fell by 26 percent, or 30,000 jobs, from 2008-2020. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, more than 360 local newsrooms have closed across the country. Schatz’s resolution affirms the significance of local news in increasing civic engagement and strengthening democratic norms and practices, and recognizes the invaluable contributions of local journalists in maintaining healthy and vibrant communities. The resolution is co-sponsored by Senators John Fetterman (D-Pa.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Angus King (I-Vt.), Laphonza Butler (D-Calif.), and Bob Casey (D-Pa.). The resolution has been endorsed by PEN America, Common Cause, Public Knowledge, and Free Press Action. “Throughout our nation’s history, local news has been a bulwark for holding power to account and advancing a pluralistic democracy that represents and includes all, irrespective of their background or status,” said Laura Schroeder, Congressional Affairs Lead at PEN America. “The erosion of local news threatens our system of checks and balances and starves communities of the information required for democratic citizenship. In an election year already ushering in alarming levels of information manipulation, local news is a crucial line of defense worth fortifying. PEN America lauds Senator Schatz’s resolution, which reaffirms local news’ indispensability to our democracy.” Schatz has led efforts in the Senate to strengthen local news, previously introducing the Future of Local News Act, legislation that would create a committee to study the state of local journalism and offer recommendations to Congress on the actions it can take to best support local news organizations.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas), member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on The Constitution, joined Senate Republican colleagues and House impeachment managers for a press conference laying out the evidence of U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas’s lawlessness and calling on Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to follow the Constitution and hold a trial in the Senate. During the press conference, Sen. Cruz said, “We’ve just witnessed history being made. Only 22 times in our nation’s history has the House of Representatives presented and delivered Articles of Impeachment to the Senate. Only twice in our nation’s history has a cabinet member been impeached by the House. The stakes of this impeachment are not some technical violations of law, but rather an enormous and growing threat to the lives and safety of millions of Americans. “Every year under Joe Biden and Alejandro Mayorkas, we have seen millions of illegal aliens crossing into this country. Alejandro Mayorkas is actively aiding and abetting the criminal invasion of this country by criminal drug cartels and illegal aliens. “… Every week, we see another horrific crime committed by criminal illegal aliens that Joe Biden and Alejandro Mayorkas have continued to release. … Joe Biden and Alejandro Mayorkas deliberately defied the law. They apprehended [Laken Riley’s] killer when he came illegally to this country. He was in El Paso. Had Joe Biden and Alejandro Mayorkas simply followed the law, they would have put him on a plane and flown him back to Venezuela and Laken Riley would still be alive. But they didn't. They defied the law. They let him go. And he went to New York City … where he was apprehended again. This time for endangering the safety of a child. If New York City had simply followed the law—if they had put him in jail—Laken Riley would still be alive. But New York City let him go, and this murderer came down to Georgia and beat Laken Riley to death with a brick. “… The House managers who are here … scare the living daylights out of Chuck Schumer and the Democrats. Tomorrow we’re going to see Chuck Schumer throw out 200 years of history and ignore the Constitution. Why? Because he does not want these managers to present the evidence of the people dying because of their policies. “The Senate has a clear obligation under the Constitution and 200 years of precedent: we need to hold a trial. We need to allow the managers to present the evidence. And then every one of us who is following the law should convict and remove Alejandro Mayorkas for aiding and abetting a criminal invasion of the United States of America.” Watch Sen.

Sen.

They care more about political clout than exercising oversight to investigate how Alejandro Mayorkas willfully aided and abetted the criminal invasion of the United States. “I had filed a resolution that allows the Senate to proceed on parallel tracks with the impeachment trial, ensuring the Senate remains constitutionally compliant with precedent. Unsurprisingly, Democrats blocked the effort and revealed their true motives to the American people. Today, I even tried to move the Senate to a closed impeachment session to discuss the constitutionality of the impeachment proceedings. They blocked this because they don’t want a trial and they can’t defend the crisis they caused at our southern border to the American people.” Read the full text of Sen.

       " 'Letter Urges for Extension of Export License Following Investigation into Biden Administration Hostility to Oil and Gas Industry WASHINGTON, D.C.\\xa0– U.S. Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.) sent a letter to the U.S.\\xa0Department of Energy (DOE) urging for an extension of time to Delfin LNG LLC’s approval to export liquefied natural gas (LNG) to European and Asian countries due to inaction on the Delfin project by other federal agencies. The senators’ letter follows the Biden administration’s deference to the radical climate lobby, instituting a pause on all pending non-Free Trade Agreement (FTA) export permit applications. In the letter, the senators wrote, “Delfin has a very strong case that it has met both criteria for an extension per DOE’s policy. Construction of the project has already begun, and there were extenuating circumstances beyond Delfin’s control that caused significant delays in the export date. … Delfin’s project is also critical to the natural gas needs of our allies. Delfin has already secured long-term contracts with five LNG off-takers for a total revenue stream of $19 billion.” Read the full letter here or below. BACKGROUND: Dear Secretary Granholm, We write to request your appropriate and timely consideration of Delfin LNG LLC’s (Delfin) application for an extension of their current approval to export LNG to a non-FTA country (Ref. Docket Nos. 13-129-LNG; 13-147-LNG.). The export authorization under the current Department of Energy (DOE) license is valid until June 1, 2024. According to DOE’s policy statement, “Policy Statement on Export Commencement Deadlines in Authorizations to Export Natural Gas to Non-Free Trade Agreement Countries,” Delfin LNG LLC must file for an extension within 90 days of June 1, 2024. As Deputy Secretary David Turk testified last month before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, DOE does not consider the current moratorium or pause on the issuance of new LNG export licenses to apply to extensions of existing projects. Delfin’s Floating LNG Project is the only LNG export project requiring an extension this year, as well as the only offshore Floating LNG (FLNG) project. Delfin has a very strong case that it has met both criteria for an extension per DOE’s policy. Construction of the project has already begun, and there were extenuating circumstances beyond Delfin’s control that caused significant delays in the export date, including MARAD’s failure to follow the deadlines in the Deepwater Port Act and new NEPA requirements in the Fiscal Responsibility Act. However, should DOE conclude that the start-of-construction criteria has not been met, Delfin requests a conditional extension that allows Delfin nine months to make Final Investment Decision on the project. This conditional extension should alleviate any remaining DOE concerns about the project proving real progress towards actual export capability thereby reducing and helping to eliminate “LNG export authorization overhang.” Delfin’s project is also critical to the natural gas needs of our allies. Delfin has already secured long-term contracts with five LNG off-takers for a total revenue stream of $19 billion. Delfin’s single largest customer is Centrica LNG, whose parent company is the largest energy supplier in the United Kingdom. Over 15 years, Centrica LNG committed to purchase one million tonnes per annum of LNG. By granting this extension and allowing proven and newly deployed technologies the time to fully mature, DOE will both foster innovative FLNG technology and prevent stranded assets.

This rule will play an essential role in safeguarding miners from cancers, silicosis and black lung disease, especially in Appalachia where black lung cases have been rapidly increasing in recent years. For generations, our brave coal miners have risked their lives to power our nation to greatness, and we will continue working together in the Senate to advance commonsense rules like this one to protect the health and welfare of these heroes,” the Senators said. “We're grateful for the Agency's initiative in implementing a rule to tackle the increasing incidence of silica-related lung diseases among both coal and metal non-metal miners. The resurgence of these diseases, particularly affecting younger miners in their 30s and 40s, underscores the urgency of this issue. This measure is vital for safeguarding miners' well-being not only in the short term but throughout their careers. The UMWA’s focus now shifts to ensuring mining companies are held accountable,” said United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) International President Cecil E. Roberts. Last June, the Senators released a statement applauding the proposed rule and calling for its swift implementation. ###\",\n",
       " 'Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Bob Casey (D-PA) and Tim Scott (R-SC) introduced the Antisemitism Awareness Act. The bill will help address antisemitic sentiment and action on college campuses—which has been rising across the Nation for years and spiked in the wake of Hamas’ terrorist attack on October 7, 2023—by requiring the U.S. Department of Education to consider the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism when enforcing federal anti-discrimination laws. “Hamas’ horrific terrorist attack on October 7 led to a dramatic increase in antisemitism on college campuses,” said Senator Casey. “Amidst this appalling increase, we must do everything we can to protect Jewish students on college campuses. This bill will make sure that going forward, the Education Department will take action against all forms of antisemitic discrimination.” “Our nation’s institutions of higher learning have become hotbeds of antisemitism, especially in the wake of the brutal attacks against Israel and innocent civilians by Hamas and Iran,” said Senator Scott. “It’s critical the Department of Education has the tools and resources it needs to investigate antisemitism and root out this vile hatred wherever it rears its ugly head.” The Antisemitism Awareness Act would make permanent the Department of Education’s usage of the IHRA’s definition of antisemitism, which is a vital tool helping to clarify and identify the various manifestations of antisemitism. Since 2018, the Department of Education has used the IHRA definition when investigating violations of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This definition is supported by President Biden’s Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism, was included in President Biden’s National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism, and has been used by the State Department since the Obama Administration.\\xa0 In addition to Senators Casey and Scott, the Antisemitism Awareness Act is cosponsored by U.S. Senators Jacky Rosen (D-NV), James Lankford (R-OK), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Rick Scott (R-FL), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), John Boozman (R-AR), Christopher Coons (D-DE), Susan Collins (R-ME), Kyrsten Sinema (I-AZ), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Kristen Gillibrand (D-NY), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), John Hickenlooper (D-CO),\\xa0Josh Hawley (R-MO), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Katie Britt (R-AL), John Fetterman (D-PA), Pete Ricketts (R-NE), Ben Cardin (D-MD), John Barrasso (R-WY), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), John Cornyn (R-TX), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV). ###',\n",
       " 'At hearing, Casey touted his new Long-Term Care Workforce Support Act Casey heard testimony from long-term care workers about the caregiving crisis and the need for federal support Watch full hearing video here Washington, D.C. - Today, U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging Chairman Bob Casey (D-PA) held a hearing entitled, “The Long-Term Care Workforce: Addressing Shortages and Improving the Profession.” The hearing examined the challenges currently facing American long-term care workers, who are often underpaid and overworked, leading to widespread worker shortages that threaten the availability of care for those who need it. At the hearing, Casey touted his new Long-Term Care Workforce Support Act, which will tackle the caregiving crisis by significantly bolstering the long-term care workforce, providing resources to ensure that caregiving can be a sustainable, lifelong career. “Today’s hearing showed that we have a crisis of caregiving in this country, and it’s a crisis that stems largely from a lack of support for and investment in our caregiving workforce,” said Chairman Casey. “We cannot say we are the greatest country in the world if we do not have the greatest caregiving in the world. My bill will make the investments that these workers, and the recipients of their care, need and deserve.” Chairman Casey invited Nicholas Smith, a Philadelphia resident who has worked in the long-term care industry for more than 25 years, to testify. Smith serves as a direct support professional at SPIN, an organization that provides lifespan services for over 3,000 people with intellectual disabilities and autism in Pennsylvania. Smith testified about the challenges faced by long-term care workers, saying, “I work nearly 65-70 hours a week…due to my work, I have missed family events, nieces’ and nephews’ recitals, and school functions…A lot of people are leaving this field to make more money. The national average for direct service professional wages is only $15.43 in long-term care. We spend time training new hires only to lose them because they cannot make a living wage. Other industries are offering more money, and while people want to stay in this field, they cannot make ends meet. Pennsylvania has a long waitlist for home and community-based services, and this is due to the workforce crisis.” Watch the full hearing here.

Fogel is a United States citizen and teacher who has been subject to an unjust and disproportionate criminal sentence by the Russian government since August 2021. Fogel was detained in the Sheremetyevo Airport for carrying about half an ounce of medical marijuana which was prescribed to him by his doctor in Pennsylvania to treat severe medical conditions. The resolution, which now heads to the full Senate for consideration, urges the Biden Administration to prioritize securing the release of Mr. Fogel—a Butler County native and Allegheny County resident—and all other U.S. citizens and permanent residents who are wrongfully detained by Russia, including Paul Whelan, Evan Gershkovich, Ksenia Khavana, Alsu Kurmasheva, and Vladimir Kara-Murza. “This resolution sends a clear, bipartisan message to Vladimir Putin and dictators like him that the United States won’t stand for the imprisonment of Americans like Marc Fogel,” said Senator Casey. “Marc is a loving father and schoolteacher who’s devoted his life to educating students around the world. The United States must do everything possible to bring Marc home and show our enemies that Americans aren’t to be used in their political games.”\\xa0  Over the last two years, Senator Casey has been pushing the Biden Administration to prioritize Marc Fogel’s case.

       " 'Casey, Baldwin pressed Administration to crack down on Chinese trade cheats, stand up for American workers WATCH: Senators joined United Steelworkers for press conference on American shipbuilding and China’s anti-competitive behavior Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Bob Casey (D-PA) and Tammy Baldwin (D-WI)\\xa0announced they successfully pushed the Biden Administration to investigate unfair trade practices by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) that undercut American shipbuilding, threaten our national security, and hurt American workers. Senators Casey and Baldwin have led their colleagues in support of the United Steelworkers’ (USW) effort to press the Biden Administration to initiate a full investigation into the PRC’s unfair trade practices in the maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors. Today, United States Trade Representative (USTR) Katherine Tai announced they are heeding that call. “Senator Baldwin and I pushed the Biden Administration to investigate the Chinese Communist Party’s shipbuilding industry to protect the American workers and manufacturers who have already paid the price for China’s cheating in this critical sector,”\\xa0said Senator Casey. “I’ll continue pressing the Administration to hold this predatory regime accountable by imposing tariffs. If we do not take on the CCP, American workers will only pay a higher cost.” “China has been cheating the rules and it’s hurting American workers and putting our national security on the line. I am glad to see the Biden Administration heed our calls and launch this investigation to hold China accountable, helping protect America’s shipbuilding industry and American workers,” said Senator Baldwin. “Wisconsin’s manufacturing workers keep our country safe, provide for their families, and keep our economy moving forward – and I won’t let China undermine them and jeopardize that.” Today, Trade Representative Tai announced that USTR accepted USW’s petition and will launch an investigation of China under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. Public comments will be accepted through May 22, 2024, and a public hearing will take place on May 29, 2024. In March, USW filed a petition under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 to call on USTR to initiate a full investigation into the PRC’s unfair trade practices in the maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors. Senators Casey and Baldwin joined USW and other labor leaders in support of the petition for a press conference and also sent a letter to Trade Representative Tai to conduct a full investigation. Over the last 20 years, the United States has lost industrial shipbuilding capacity as a result of China’s increasingly aggressive subsidization of their shipbuilding. Chinese state-owned enterprises and other facilities in China are now capable of producing over 1,000 ocean-going vessels a year, while the United States currently produces fewer than ten. While shipbuilding capacity, suppliers, and shipyards remain vital to the U.S. economy and national security, uncompetitive trade practices have led to 25,000 domestic shipbuilding suppliers leaving the U.S. market over the past 20 years. Senator Casey is a staunch supporter of Buy America standards, as well as legislation to develop American manufacturing capacity. In November, he\\xa0sent\\xa0a letter to President Biden sharing their serious concerns about potential reductions of Section 232 and 301 tariffs previously imposed on China on national security grounds.\\xa0That month, he also voted against a resolution to effectively remove Buy American standards for electric vehicle (EV) chargers and force the United States to continue relying on China for products critical to the next generation of clean vehicle infrastructure. He fought to pass the\\xa0Build America, Buy America Act\\xa0as a part of the\\xa0Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which\\xa0requires that all of the iron, steel, manufactured products, and construction materials used in infrastructure projects are produced in the United States. Casey also fought to pass the\\xa0Inflation Reduction Act, which included tax credits for individuals and companies\\xa0manufacturing or deploying clean energy technologies to help lower costs and secure our energy independence, as well as\\xa0his provision\\xa0to provide a “domestic content” bonus credit for companies that use American steel, iron, and manufactured goods. ###',\n",

Currently, salaried employees at these critical national security facilities are included in higher paying locality pay areas than their hourly employee counterparts. “The [Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee’s] recommended regulation will enhance military readiness during a time of global turmoil and establish fairness for the federal workforce, overcoming years of division that has undermined the sense of fairness and equity between the two major pay systems. We urge you to swiftly accept the recommended regulation,” the Senators wrote. Senators Casey and Collins have continually advocated for the harmonization of locality pay areas for hourly and salaried workers to lift a financial burden that has impacted federal workers for many years. In addition to Senators Casey and Collins, the letter was signed by Senators Jack Reed (D-RI), Katie Britt (R-AL), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Angus King (I-ME), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Ed Markey (D-MA). Full text of the letter can be found below and the signed PDF can be found HERE. April 17, 2024 Dear Director Ahuja, We write to you urging swift action on the regulatory recommendation agreed to by the Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee (FPRAC) at its December 21, 2023, meeting to harmonize locality pay areas for hourly and salaried federal workers. As you know, for over 15 years, FPRAC has grappled with the issue of inconsistent locality boundaries between the Federal Wage System (FWS), which determines the pay of hourly Wage Grade (WG) employees, and the General Schedule (GS) pay scale, which determines the pay of salaried GS employees. We recognize and commend FPRAC’s recent work to align the FWS method of determining local labor market boundaries with the GS method. FPRAC's 9-1 vote, backed by representatives of both federal labor and management, to recommend this updated regulation would resolve an issue that many of us have been pushing OPM to adopt for years.\\xa0 Despite strong support for the proposed regulation, three months have passed and OPM has not yet formally accepted the FPRAC recommendation. We ask that you act swiftly to accept the recommendation and begin to move the proposed regulation through the rulemaking process. Revising 5 CFR § 532.211 will enable the federal government to compete with the private sector for the skilled tradesmen and women serving in critical government functions all across the country. FPRAC’s recommended regulation will enhance military readiness during a time of global turmoil and establish fairness for the federal workforce, overcoming years of division that has undermined the sense of fairness and equity between the two major pay systems. Thank you for your consideration of our concerns, and for OPM’s continued work supporting the federal government’s most valuable resource—its people. ###\\xa0\",\n",

This comprehensive bill would ensure caregiving can be a sustainable, lifelong career by providing substantial new funding to support workers in every part of the long-term care industry, from nursing homes to home-care to assisted living facilities. The bill comes as the Nation faces a caregiving crisis marked by widespread worker shortages due to low pay and long hours across the essential industry. The Long-Term Care Workforce Support Act is supported by a wide swath of organizations working on behalf of care workers, older adults, and people with disabilities who rely on care to live with health and dignity. See below what they are saying about how this legislation will transform the caregiving workforce and the availability and accessibility of high-quality care: Ai-Jen Poo, CEO and President of the National Domestic Workers Alliance: “Our care workers need and deserve good jobs, including better pay, benefits, and access to paid leave. As the foundation of our entire workforce, these essential workers provide life-giving care that enables our families and communities to thrive — but without greater public investment, they remain trapped in cycles of poverty. The Long-Term Care Workforce Support Act is an important step forward in strengthening our long-undervalued and underfunded care workforce. We applaud Senator Bob Casey for his leadership on this issue.” Mary Kay Henry, President of the Service Employees International Union: “Direct care workers form the backbone of the long-term care system, and the growing workforce crisis limits access to crucial services, preventing elders and people with disabilities from receiving\\xa0high quality, person-centered care in the setting that’s best for them and their families. This crisis is exacerbated by low pay, poor\\xa0job quality and a lack of respect for the workforce, which consists largely of women of color. The Long-Term Care Workforce Support Act will make important new investments across the long-term care workforce, raising wages, expanding access to training and opportunities for professional advancement, and helping to ensure that care jobs are good jobs.” Joe Macbeth, CEO and President of the National Alliance for Direct Support Professionals: “For decades, the long-term supports and services system has failed to adequately address its workforce challenges. These issues have been researched, documented and shared with policy makers at the state and federal levels on a regular basis. We know that building a competent and stable workforce is a key lynchpin to the success of the Long-Term Supports and Services and the millions of Americans who rely on it. The National Alliance for Direct Support Professionals thanks Senator Casey for introducing the Long-Term Care Workforce Support Act that takes a bold step to finally invest the financial recourses and worker protections\\xa0into building and strengthening the most important element of long-term care – the direct support workforce.”\\xa0 Edwin S. Jayne, Director of Federal Government Affairs, American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees: “The Long-Term Care Workforce Support Act is a crucial step toward building a more equitable, sustainable and compassionate care economy…This crucial legislation not only underscores the importance of protecting the health and well-being of our nation’s aging population and individuals with disabilities, but also represents a vital step in bolstering the care economy by recognizing the indispensable contributions of direct care workers.” Kenneth Hobby, President, and Maynard Friesz, Vice President of Policy of Cure SMA (Spinal Muscular Dystrophy): “Cure SMA is pleased to support the Long-term Care Workforce Support Act. Your legislation would help address the caregiving crisis faced by individuals with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and other disabilities by investing in public-private strategies to expand caregiving services and strengthen the long-term care workforce…Cure SMA and the entire SMA community appreciate your leadership and efforts to expand caregiving services and strengthen the long-term care workforce for individuals with SMA and other disabilities.” Amy Robins, Senior Director of Policy, PHI National: “This is a historic piece of legislation designed to systematically improve direct care job quality and address the workforce crisis in long-term care.

       " \"Caregivers are widely underpaid, often living in poverty, leading to chronic shortage in nursing homes and assisted living facilities WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) introduced the Long-Term Care Workforce Support Act, a bill to alleviate the long-term care workforce shortages by supporting the workers who perform this critical work. Millions of families with aging loved ones and people with disabilities require skilled care to live, but many caregivers today work long hours for low pay, resulting in some workers being forced to leave their field for higher paying jobs. This instability has resulted in widespread worker shortages for those in need of essential care. The Long-Term Care Workforce Support Act would ensure that caregiving can be a sustainable, lifelong career by improving caregiver compensation, benefits, and support systems. “Having served as my grandmother’s primary caregiver as she aged, I know the hard work that goes into caregiving and the world of difference high-quality care makes for our loved ones,” said Senator Baldwin. “Right now, we're facing a desperate shortage in our long-term care workforce and sadly, it’s no surprise: many caregivers are forced to be on the clock for long hours, get low pay, and work in tough conditions. We owe it to caregivers who devote their lives to helping others to invest in the caregiving workforce, giving these compassionate workers the respect they deserve, attracting fresh talent, and ensuring our loved ones get high-quality care.” Caregivers are widely underpaid, earning a median wage of $15.43 an hour and often living in poverty. The result is caregivers are in short supply—a recent survey revealed 92% of nursing home respondents and nearly 70% of assisted living facilities reported significant or severe workforce shortages. Another recent survey of home and community-based services (HCBS) providers showed all 50 states experiencing home care worker shortages, and 43 states reported that some HCBS providers have closed due to worker shortages.

       " 'Last year, the Biden Administration heeded Baldwin’s calls and expanded the sale of E15 fuel to be sold during the summer months WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) joined her Democratic and Republican colleagues in urging the Biden Administration to permit the summertime sale of E15 fuel. The Senators note that American biofuels are a clean and reliable energy solution that will help drive down fuel costs for consumers. “As your previous temporary waivers have proven, permitting the sale of higher blends of biofuels like E15 through the summer driving season bolsters the domestic fuel supply, lowers consumer costs, and promotes the environmental benefits of American biofuels and modern agriculture,” wrote the Senators. “Providing continued access to a more affordable, lower-carbon fuel, like E15, will not only save drivers money at the pump, but it will also help farmers across the country,” said Harold Wolle, president of the National Corn Growers Association. “Yet, time is of the essence as we quickly approach the summer months. We are deeply appreciative to the bipartisan support we are receiving from our Senate champions on this issue.” Senator Baldwin has long championed increasing the use of biofuels to reduce the price at the pump and support Wisconsin’s farmers, producers, and rural communities. Last year, Senator Baldwin and a bipartisan group of colleagues\\xa0called on the Biden administration\\xa0to permit the year-round sale of E15 fuel in 2023 and introduced legislation\\xa0to allow the year-round, nationwide sale of ethanol blends higher than 10%. Shortly thereafter,\\xa0the Biden administration announced they would allow E15 fuel to be sold during the summer months. In addition to Senator Baldwin, the letter was also signed by U.S. Senators John Thune (R-SD), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Josh Hawley (R-MO), John Hoeven (R-ND), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Gary Peters (D-MI), Pete Ricketts (R-NE), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Tina Smith (D-MN), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), and J.D. Vance (R-OH). A full version of the letter is available here and below. Dear President Biden: We write to request that you again take swift executive action to permit the sale of E15 fuel during the 2024 summer driving season by extending the Reid vapor pressure (RVP) waiver, nationwide, from June 1 through September 15. Enabling the year-round sale of E15, as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) permitted in both 2022 and 2023 through nationwide temporary waivers under Clean Air Act Section 211(c)(4)(C)(ii), helped allow our energy supply chain to “address extreme and unusual fuel supply circumstances caused by the war in Ukraine that are affecting all regions of the nation.” Unfortunately, this underlying justification remains applicable as Russia’s war of aggression continues to weigh on global energy and security. Further, Iran-backed aggression in the Middle East, specifically Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, presents new threats to global energy markets and our energy security. To counter these influences, we must pursue an all-of-the-above energy strategy, which includes leveraging domestic biofuels. As your previous temporary waivers have proven, permitting the sale of higher blends of biofuels like E15 through the summer driving season bolsters the domestic fuel supply, lowers consumer costs, and promotes the environmental benefits of American biofuels and modern agriculture. Furthermore, temporary action is again required in light of the EPA’s announcement to postpone until 2025 the implementation of eight state petitions to sell E15 year-round. As you know, the consideration of state action has led to a historic agreement between liquid fuel stakeholders in support of securing a permanent legislative solution to allow nationwide, year-round E15 sales, while respecting each state’s authority to opt-out of such a program. Taking temporary action now will continue the uninterrupted sale of E15 for what would be the sixth consecutive year, a major win for consumer choice and emissions reductions. Lastly, extending the nationwide sale of E15 could again add billions of gallons of ethanol to the fuel supply at a time domestic inventories of crude oil and petroleum products are at their lowest point since May 2004, below when the EPA issued its 2022 and 2023 waivers. Furthermore, additional decreases in OPEC oil production will only amplify the already robust market for U.S. exports at a time of rising fuel demand.

       " 'In March, Senators Baldwin and Casey joined the Steelworkers to call on the Biden Administration to crack down on Chinese trade cheats, stand up for American workers WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Bob Casey (D-PA) announced they successfully pushed the Biden Administration to investigate unfair trade practices by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) that undercut American shipbuilding, threaten our national security, and hurt American workers. Senators Baldwin and Casey have led their colleagues in support of the United Steelworkers’ (USW) effort to have United States Trade Representative (USTR) Katherine Tai initiate a full investigation into the PRC’s unfair trade practices in the maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors. Today, the USTR announced they were heeding that call and launching an investigation into the PRC. “China has been cheating the rules and it’s hurting American workers and putting our national security on the line. I am glad to see the Biden Administration heed our calls and launch this investigation to hold China accountable, helping protect America’s shipbuilding industry and American workers,” said Senator Baldwin. “Wisconsin’s manufacturing workers keep our country safe, provide for their families, and keep our economy moving forward – and I won’t let China undermine them and jeopardize that.” “Senator Baldwin and I pushed the Biden Administration to investigate the Chinese Communist Party’s shipbuilding industry to protect the American workers and manufacturers who have already paid the price for China’s cheating in this critical sector,” said Senator Casey. “I’ll continue pressing the Administration to hold this predatory regime accountable by imposing tariffs. If we do not take on the CCP, American workers will only pay a higher cost.” Today, the Ambassador Katherine Tai announced that USTR accepted USW’s petition and are launching an investigation of China under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. Public comments will be accepted through May 22, 2024, and a public hearing will take place on May 29, 2024. In March, Senators Baldwin and Casey joined USW and other labor leaders for a press conference in support of the American shipbuilding industry and to call on Trade Representative Tai to conduct a full investigation. Other unions joining the USW in filing the trade petition include the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, and the Maritime Trades Department, AFL-CIO. Earlier this month, U.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Bob Casey (D-PA) announced growing support for their push for the Biden Administration to open an investigation, leading a letter of support with Senators Sherrod Brown (D-OH), John Fetterman (D-PA), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Mazie Hirono (D-HI). Over the last 20 years, the United States has lost industrial shipbuilding capacity while the PRC’s subsidized shipbuilding has only grown. Chinese state-owned enterprises and other facilities in the PRC are now capable of producing over 1,000 ocean-going vessels a year, while the United States currently produces fewer than ten. While shipbuilding capacity, suppliers, and shipyards remain vital to the U.S. economy and national security, the PRC’s uncompetitive trade practices have led to 25,000 domestic shipbuilding suppliers leaving the U.S. market over the past 20 years. Senator Baldwin has long championed Buy America policies to support American businesses and workers. She fought to advance her American Made Navy Act in this year’s annual defense legislation, which would ensure by 2033 any new Navy ship purchased uses 100% domestically produced materials, like propulsion systems, shipboard components, couplings, shafts, support bearings, and more. She also worked to include strong Buy America standards in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. ###',\n",
       " 'Despite over 175 years of Racine workers building farming equipment, jobs now in jeopardy of being shipped to Mexico; Baldwin: “Moving production to Mexico as you are considering would…be a slap in the face to the workers who have given so much”\\r\\n RACINE, WI – Today, U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) called on CNH Industrial to reverse course in laying off hundreds of Wisconsin workers and moving jobs to Mexico despite the company posting record profits, engaging in stock buybacks to enrich shareholders, and paying the CEO nearly 350 times more than the average union worker in Racine. “Agricultural machinery has been made in Racine by your workers for over 175 years—they have made Case-New Holland into the international manufacturing powerhouse it is today,” wrote Senator Baldwin in a letter to Scott Wine, CEO of CNH Industrial. “Moving production to Mexico as you are considering would not only be a slap in the face to the workers who have given so much, it would destroy the institutional knowledge that your workforce has developed over decades of building agricultural equipment.” While CNH Industrial announced that these layoffs are a part of a broader company-wide reorganization, intended to reduce costs by $150 million, the burden of the cost savings is falling almost entirely on the unionized workforce. While claiming they need to save money, in its last financial year the company has earned record profits, compensated its executives handsomely, and engaged in stock buybacks to enrich wealthy insiders. CNH spent $652 million on stock buybacks last year, or four times more than the $150 million the company hopes to save by reducing its workforce. “Despite delivering record profits for your company, your workers in Racine are being told their services are too expensive and are no longer welcome. An average worker at your Racine plant earns $52,000 annually. Last year, you made nearly 350 times that, $18 million. In 2022, you made $22 million and in 2021 you made $44 million,” wrote Senator Baldwin to CNH CEO Scott Wine. “During those three years, you have earned more money than you paid to all of the workers in Racine—the ones you have now told they are too expensive to invest in—combined.” Senator Baldwin also questioned whether CNH Industrial properly notified the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development (DWD) of their workforce reduction, which would unlock critical funding for the agency to help laid off workers file for unemployment, update their resumes, and connect with workforce training programs. When companies like CNH reduce their workforce by more than 25 percent, Wisconsin law requires employers to provide 60 days’ notice to their workers, the DWD, their collective bargaining representatives, and local officials. “Forgoing the notice is not only illegal, but it denies your workers these benefits to which they are entitled,” wrote Senator Baldwin. “To my knowledge, your notification to your workers and their representatives were well short of the 60 days required by law.” The announced layoffs come after over 1,000 CNH Industrial workers in Iowa and Wisconsin went on strike for a better contract for more than 260 days from 2022 to 2023. Senator Baldwin joined workers on the picket line in support of their fight for a fair contract. CNH and its workers reached an agreement in January 2023 and given the fact that layoffs came so shortly after the company signed a new collective bargaining agreement, it raises concerns that these layoffs were made as retribution. “Abandon plans to move production to Mexico and make clear to the workers in Wisconsin that you are committed to manufacturing the best agricultural equipment in the world in the city where it all started—Racine, Wisconsin,” concluded Senator Baldwin.  A full version of this letter is available here and below. Scott W. Wine Chief Executive Officer CNH Industrial 6900 Veterans Blvd. Burr Ridge, IL 60527 Dear Mr. Wine: I am deeply disappointed by your recent decision to lay off over 200 workers at your facility in Racine, Wisconsin. Moreover, I understand that you are threatening further layoffs in Racine, possibly reducing force down to as low as 150 workers. That would be a tragic outcome for your company, which traces its roots in Wisconsin back to 1842—before Wisconsin was even a state. Agricultural machinery has been made in Racine by your workers for over 175 years—they have made Case-New Holland into the international manufacturing powerhouse it is today. Your company has communicated that these layoffs are part of the company-wide reorganization that you announced in November 2023. The fact that this decision comes so shortly after you signed a new collective bargaining agreement with these workers raises concerns that this layoff was made as retribution for the workers daring to go on strike last year to secure the gains in that contract. While your corporate communications claim the pain from the restructuring will be shared with management, a closer look reveals that you merely changed the name of your executive team from Senior Leadership Team to the Global Leadership Team and reduced the number of executives on the team through restructuring rather than layoffs. I suspect that the majority of the burden of the $150 million in cost reduction you have planned will fall almost entirely on the shoulders of your unionized workforce in the United States, particularly in Wisconsin. Moving production to Mexico as you are considering would not only be a slap in the face to the workers who have given so much, it would destroy the institutional knowledge that your workforce has developed over decades of building agricultural equipment. For this reason, I doubt that a move to Mexico will reap the savings you project. It is doubly frustrating that these cost cuts are coming despite your company’s recent strong financial performance. According to your own financial reports, CNH is breaking profit records. This quote is from your annual report, released just a few months ago: “the Company delivered record full year revenue and [Earnings Before Interest and Taxes] margins across both Agriculture and Construction segments, while the Financial Services segment achieved a record receivable portfolio balance and segment net income, bringing the consolidated company to achieve record net income and earnings per share.” Despite delivering record profits for your company, your workers in Racine are being told their services are too expensive and are no longer welcome. An average worker at your Racine plant earns $52,000 annually. Last year, you made nearly 350 times that, $18 million. In 2022, you made $22 million and in 2021 you made $44 million. During those three years, you have earned more money than you paid to all of the workers in Racine—the ones you have now told they are too expensive to invest in—combined. Additionally, CNH spent $652 million on stock buybacks last year, or four times more than the $150 million you hope to save by reducing your workforce. I am also aware that CNH has recently been awarded four contracts by the Defense Logistics Agency at the Department of Defense worth a total of $1 million—a sizable investment in CNH by American taxpayers. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, it is always my expectation that when we spend taxpayer dollars, we should be investing those dollars in American workers. While workers have been laid off, as of this writing, your company has still not filed a layoff notice with the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development (DWD). Wisconsin’s Business Closing and Mass Layoff Law requires employers that make a reduction in force which affects at least 25 percent of its workforce to provide 60 days’ notice to: the workers; the DWD; any collective bargaining unit representative; and, the highest official of the municipality where the employment site is located. Notifying DWD unlocks funding for the agency to deploy to the laid off workers to help them file for unemployment, update their resumes, and connect with workforce training programs. Forgoing the notice is not only illegal, but it denies your workers these benefits to which they are entitled. To my knowledge, your notification to your workers and their representatives were well short of the 60 days required by law. I have shared a copy of this letter with DWD Secretary Amy Pechacek should her Department decide to investigate the matter. While I am disappointed by your recent leadership of CNH, there is still time to reverse course. I encourage you to re-commit to your American workforce, particularly the workers in Racine who have delivered your company its record profits. Abandon plans to move production to Mexico and make clear to the workers in Wisconsin that you are committed to manufacturing the best agricultural equipment in the world in the city where it all started—Racine, Wisconsin. Sincerely, ###',\n",
       " '“This week should have been spent working to pass our bipartisan border compromise – one that would secure our border, curb the flow of fentanyl into the country, and fix parts of our broken immigration system – not playing political games” WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin released a statement following the Senate’s vote to dismiss the articles of impeachment against U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas: “Impeachment is a sacred and solemn duty of Congress that is solely reserved to hold those accountable for high crimes and misdemeanors. This is a responsibility that I do not take lightly. Unfortunately, what we had in front of us today entirely failed to meet that high standard, lacked evidence, and was just an attempt to score cheap political points, while moving us no closer to fixing the real issues we face at our Southern border. Wisconsin communities grappling with fentanyl deaths are no closer to ending this crisis. Our border agents are no closer to getting the support they need and deserve. And, our broken immigration system is no closer to being fixed. “This week should have been spent working to pass our bipartisan border compromise – one that would secure our border, curb the flow of fentanyl into the country, and fix parts of our broken immigration system – not playing partisan political games. I remain committed to doing the hard work with my Democratic and Republican colleagues to secure our border and keep Wisconsin communities safe.” ###',\n",
       " 'Baldwin also leads bipartisan effort to close loophole that’s allowing bad actors to evade scrutiny for small-dollar packages WASHINGTON, D.C – U.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Mike Braun (R-IN) introduced the Ensure Accountability in the De Minimis Act, bipartisan legislation to help stop packages coming into the United States that contain illicit drugs like fentanyl, counterfeit goods, or products made with forced labor. The bill provides clarity for what kind of small-dollar products and packages can enter the country through the expedited process that has minimal customs scrutiny. Currently, small-dollar imports with a value of less than $800 are allowed into the U.S. duty-free and with little customs scrutiny, known as the de minimis channel. However, this channel has been abused by countries like China who are sending hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of products into the U.S. market, undermining U.S. manufacturers and letting illicit substances into our communities. “We have a responsibility to ensure packages that are coming into our country are not harming Americans, but right now we are falling short. Bad actors in China are taking advantage of a trade loophole to traffic counterfeit goods that undermine our businesses and illegal substances like fentanyl that are crushing our communities. We must do more to stop it,” said Senator Baldwin. “I’m proud to work with Republicans and Democrats to give us tools to better identify these counterfeit products and harmful drugs from coming into the country, hold bad actors accountable, and protect American families. I am glad to take this step forward and will keep fighting to close this trade loophole that is allowing fentanyl into the country.” “This bill would increase transparency and accountability for bad actors that take advantage of the de minimis threshold. In recent years, the majority of de minimis shipments have come from China, our top trade competitor. We need to make sure they are not gaming the system,” said Senator Braun. According to U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP), more than 771 million packages came into the U.S. under the de minimis rule that lacks customs scrutiny in Fiscal Year 2021, almost double the amount of packages in Fiscal Year 2018. Of the 771.5 million packages, over half originated in China. The Ensure Accountability in the De Minimis Act requires Treasury and CBP to craft regulations to enhance data collection for de minimis imports to determine if 1) they are made with forced labor; 2) they are counterfeit; or, 3) they are a controlled substance (i.e. fentanyl or precursor chemicals). Additionally, the bill limits which persons are allowed to use the channel, increases coordination between agencies monitoring international trade, and strengthens penalties for repeat offenders who are abusing the channel. Last year, Senators Baldwin and Bill Cassidy (R-LA) introduced the De Minimis Reciprocity Act to close the de minimis loophole by excluding untrustworthy countries like China from using the de minimis channel. The bipartisan legislation would also require more information on every package entering the U.S. and use the revenue proceeds to establish a fund for reshoring industry from China.

       " 'WASHINGTON – Upon learning two IRS whistleblowers have been unsuccessful in securing a sit-down with agency leadership, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) took today’s Senate Finance Committee hearing as an opportunity to urge Commissioner Daniel Werfel to finally accept their meeting requests.\\xa0 \"I know [IRS Supervisory Special Agent Gary Shapley and Special Agent Joseph Ziegler] asked to meet with you. […] I would assume they want to tell you what’s wrong within the handling of certain cases. I would think you, at the top of the IRS, would want to listen to them. “I’m going to do now what I told them I would do: I was going to ask you to meet with the two of them and just listen to them. Whether you take action or not is up to you, but I think you ought to at least listen to them. I think whistleblowers throughout government are some of the most patriotic people I know, and I would ask you to do that.”\\xa0 Grassley then asked about the IRS Whistleblower Program he shepherded through Congress, which, to date, has recouped over $6 billion for the taxpayer. He also pressed Werfel on the steps IRS is taking to better safeguard taxpayers’ sensitive data. Full video is below, followed by subject-specific excerpts from Grassley’s questioning.\\xa0  VIDEO Addressing Whistleblower Program Backlogs: “[...T]he average wait time for people to get their case closed has gotten longer and is now up to 10 years. The long average wait time is in part due to the IRS policy against paying partial awards. Under this policy, the IRS will wait years until all years of a claim are completed to pay anything whatsoever. Effectively, the IRS has created barriers to paying awards on its own that are not in the Whistleblower statute passed by Congress. “You need to examine the unnecessary policy in the IRS Revenue Manual and work to allow partial awards to be paid to whistleblowers as quickly as possible. Could you do that?\" Werfel characterized Grassley’s concern as a “very high priority.” Protecting Taxpayer Information: “How was an activist with plans to steal taxpayer information able to get hired and gain access to taxpayer information? What actions is the IRS taking to ensure an activist employee or contractor is never again able to access and share sensitive taxpayer information?” In response, Werfel recited IRS’ to-do list for bolstering data security. The commissioner added, “All of this is ongoing and put in place to make sure this type of unauthorized access by a contractor or an IRS employee can never happen again. […] Unauthorized access from insider threats, it’s impossible to get rid of completely. But I’m committed to reducing the probability to as small as it can be by putting in the sweat equity to close all those gaps.” -30- nav-mobile-modal search-mobile-modal',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON – Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) today joined Sens. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and Bob Casey (D-Pa.) in introducing a bill to help combat antisemitism on college campuses, which spiked following Hamas’ October 7, 2023 attack on Israel. The bipartisan Antisemitism Awareness Act would instruct the Department of Education to use the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism when enforcing federal anti-discrimination laws on campus.\\xa0 “There have been disturbing reports of Jewish students on American college campuses targeted for harassment in the course of anti-Israel protests. The Education Department is charged with investigating antisemitism at higher-ed institutions, and it should be using the most effective methods to do so. We must be uncompromising in our efforts to call out and condemn antisemitism. Such hateful, discriminatory behavior has no place in our nation,” Grassley said. “Our nation’s institutions of higher learning have become hotbeds of antisemitism, especially in the wake of the brutal attacks against Israel and innocent civilians by Hamas and Iran,” Scott said. “It’s critical the Department of Education has the tools and resources it needs to investigate antisemitism and root out this vile hatred wherever it rears its ugly head.” “Hamas’ horrific terrorist attack on October 7 led to a dramatic increase in antisemitism on college campuses,” Casey said. “Amidst this appalling increase, we must do everything we can to protect Jewish students on college campuses. This bill will make sure that going forward, the Education Department will take action against all forms of anti-Semitic discrimination.” Grassley, Scott and Casey are joined by 27 Senate cosponsors.\\xa0 Download bill text HERE.\\xa0 Background: The IHRA’s definition of antisemitism is a vital tool to clarify and identify manifestations of antisemitism. The Department of Education since 2018 has used the IHRA definition to investigate violations of Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title VI. The Antisemitism Awareness Act would require the agency to permanently adopt that language.\\xa0 Grassley in October called on\\xa0the Education Secretary to ensure universities’ enforcement of federal laws against discrimination on college campuses. He also met with the Executive Director of the Jewish Federation of Greater Des Moines to hear how Iowans are standing with Israel in the wake of Hamas’ attack. \\xa0 Learn more about several Grassley-backed priorities to support Israel HERE.

       " 'WASHINGTON – Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), co-chair of the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control, is leading bipartisan legislation to enhance global precursor chemical destruction efforts. The Destruction Initiative for Stored Precursors Overseas and Safe Enforcement (DISPOSE) Act would facilitate U.S. collaboration with partner countries, including Mexico, Colombia and Peru, to ensure seized precursor chemicals are destroyed. The legislation is cosponsored by Sens. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) and Jim Risch (R-Idaho), senior member and ranking member, respectively, of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “Deadly drugs find their way into our country every day, leaving loved ones and entire communities grieving,” Grassley said. “To stop this tragedy, we need to begin at the source. Our bill would target the first link in the illicit drug supply chain in order to cut off this poisonous pipeline. By working with global partners to root out precursor chemicals, we can help stop the flow of drugs and save lives.” \\xa0 “I’m proud to join Senator Grassley in introducing this bill that would facilitate United States engagement with our partners abroad to destroy seized drugs and prevent them from making it to our borders,” Shaheen said. “This legislation would work to ensure that these dangerous drugs are not diverted back into the illicit drug supply chain and are destroyed in environmentally responsible ways.”\\xa0 “Illicit fentanyl and other synthetic opioids pose an unprecedented threat to American families. Far too many people in America know the heartache associated with the loss of life related to these deadly substances,” Risch said. “Addressing this threat requires effective cooperation with international partners. This legislation will deepen cooperation with Mexico and other countries in the Western Hemisphere to verifiably destroy seized precursor chemicals that would have otherwise been used to manufacture illicit drugs claiming so many American lives.” Background Precursor chemicals form the basis of illicit drugs like fentanyl, cocaine and methamphetamine. Currently, the United States has a limited view of how much – or how little – others nations are doing to destroy seized precursor chemicals. For instance, at a Senate Drug Caucus hearing in October, a Homeland Security Investigations witness testified that the Mexican government does not provide proof to the U.S. that it destroys the precursors they seize. Recent reports also revealed that Mexico altered its data reporting to artificially inflate the number of precursor seizures made by the Mexican government. The DISPOSE Act would increase cooperation with global partners by directing the State Department, in consultation with the Departments of Justice and Defense, to create the Precursor Chemical Destruction Initiative. The program would establish benchmarks and reporting requirements for partner countries to improve and increase rates of precursor seizure and destruction. To ensure successful implementation and transparency across branches of government, the legislation also requires a report to Congress on the results of the program. As Senate Drug Caucus co-chair, Grassley last year released a report cataloguing the U.S. and Mexico’s failed efforts to combat drug trafficking and recommended action to dismantle the critical infrastructure used to manufacture drugs, including precursor chemicals. Grassley also penned a letter with fellow Drug Caucus co-chair Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) demanding China take strong and decisive action to halt the flow of precursor chemicals from China to Mexico.

       " 'WASHINGTON – Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) at today’s Senate Finance Committee hearing advocated for Iowa agriculture, grilling U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Ambassador Katherine Tai on the Biden administration’s “abdication of leadership on trade” and urging her to go to bat for American ethanol in Brazil.\\xa0  VIDEO Iowa is a U.S. agriculture powerhouse. The state is number one in corn, pork and egg production and second in soybean production. Iowa exported over $16.5 billion in agriculture products in 2022. That’s why Grassley is a force behind policies to reduce trade barriers for U.S. products overseas. Under the Biden administration’s watch, U.S. ag exports decreased by over $17 billion in 2023; this year’s ag trade deficit is projected to be $30.5 billion. Excerpts from Grassley’s exchange with Ambassador Tai follow.\\xa0 Boosting U.S. Competitiveness on Digital Trade “There’s been a bipartisan agreement on this committee on critical issues such as free cross-border data flow, data localization, open markets and intellectual property protection. […] Our competitors repeatedly seek to discriminate against U.S. companies and impede access to their markets. Yet, the Biden administration has pulled back from negotiations on digital service trades and rejected long-term, long-held, bipartisan principles against discriminatory practices of our partners.\\xa0 “Why is USTR allowing other countries to set the rules that will put American companies at a disadvantage? This can’t be consistent with USTR’s mission.” Tai affirmed Grassley’s assertion the Biden administration’s USTR has “pulled back” on digital trade, though she failed to provide substantive reasons for doing so. She highlighted Grassley’s work to rein in Big Tech through his American Innovation and Choice Online Act and the Kids Online Safety Act.\\xa0 Restoring Brazilian Market Access for American Ethanol “The last time you appeared before this committee I urged you to negotiate lower tariffs on ethanol with Brazil. While I understand you are currently negotiating this matter, the results have been lackluster. Brazil increased its duties on ethanol this year from 16 to 18 percent and continues to enjoy importing its ethanol tariff-free. This ethanol competes with home grown ethanol in California’s low-carbon fuel standard, but also in sustainable aviation fuel. “What is the administration doing to press Brazil to lower its tariffs? What concrete measures [is] the administration considering in the negotiation?”\\xa0 “[USTR is in coordination with USDA…], actively engaging with our counterparts in Brazil on market access barriers to U.S. ethanol, including those tariffs and regulatory barriers you’re talking about,” Tai confirmed. “Our objective is to ensure U.S. ethanol can, once again, compete on a level playing field with domestically produced ethanol in Brazil.

       " 'Q: How is the IRS measuring up in service to the American taxpayer? A: When Iowans contact my office for help with a federal agency, it often involves a problem they are having with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), from getting questions answered in a timely manner or receiving an expected refund from a tax return, and more. As a taxpayer watchdog, I spearhead efforts to protect taxpayer rights and strengthen taxpayer services at the IRS. Listening to feedback from Iowans informs my work at the federal level, including when I served on the National Bipartisan Commission to Restructure the IRS. After holding a dozen public hearings, including a field hearing in Des Moines, I pushed to implement reforms that were included in landmark legislation enacted in 1998 called the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act. We identified key issues bogging down operations at the IRS, from antiquated computer systems to a dysfunctional culture spoiling the agency’s mission to serve the American taxpayer. More recently, as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee I led the Taxpayer First Act enacted in 2019. This legislation was the culmination of a bipartisan, bicameral effort to modernize the IRS and continue to protect taxpayer rights. Among other achievements, this legislation created a truly independent office of appeals, required the IRS to better assist victims of identity theft, and curtail enforcement abuses that had led to the IRS seizing assets without any underlying criminal activity. As former chairman of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, I’m working to put the brakes on an emerging activist agenda poisoning the waters at the IRS. This mindset weakens confidence in the fair administration of federal tax laws and undermines our system of voluntary compliance. From the inappropriate targeting of certain conservative groups during the Obama administration to unprecedented leaks of sensitive taxpayer information in the Biden administration, I’m pushing to clean up the mess at the IRS. In January, the nonpartisan National Taxpayer Advocate released its annual report mandated by Congress to analyze IRS operations from one year to the next. Among the most serious problems identified in the report: extreme backlogs and processing delays impacting millions of taxpayers; insufficient telephone and in-person service, live assistors answered only 29% of total calls in fiscal year 2023; identity theft, victims of tax-related identity theft waited nearly 19 months in 2023 to have their returns processed and refunds received; inability to hire, recruit and train IRS personnel; and, poor operational efficiency for appeals, resulting in prolonged dispute resolution for taxpayers. Despite enactment of the Taxpayer First Act and other legislation, continuous and diligent oversight of the IRS is necessary to ensure the IRS is carrying out the law as intended. Q: What did you ask the IRS Commissioner at the recent Senate Finance Committee hearing? A: The IRS Commissioner testified the day after Tax Day to answer questions about the IRS budget and tax filing season. Through the first week of April, the IRS processed more than 100 million individual tax returns. Tens of millions of Americans rushed to get their returns filed by April 15, or filed extensions due Oct. 15. As many burned the midnight oil during tax season, I’m reminded both the current and former Taxpayer Advocate have said customer service, rather than enforcement, is the best way to close the tax gap to help Americans file their taxes and pay what they owe. And yet, the Biden administration pushed for $80 billion in new IRS funding, outside of the regular appropriations process, that was included in the partisan, so-called Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 that largely beefed up enforcement measures, and has requested an additional $104 billion in funding, with more than half directed towards more enforcement. I pushed to sharpen congressional oversight teeth to hold the IRS accountable on how it spends the money. Despite claiming IRS audits wouldn’t target taxpayers making less than $400,000 a year, reports show most new audits targeted taxpayers earning below $200,000. Congress later rescinded $21.6 billion as the Biden administration struggled to put its money where its mouth was. I also pressed the IRS Commissioner to do a better job protecting taxpayer information and whistleblowers who come forward. Every American who files their tax return, from the President of the United States to a small business owner in Iowa, ought to have full confidence their sensitive information is protected and secure from snoops and wrongdoers. As a longtime champion for whistleblowers, I urged the IRS Commissioner to fix the backlog that makes whistleblowers wait up to 10 years or more to receive monetary awards they are entitled to for blowing the whistle on tax cheats. Whistleblowers stick out their necks and put their livelihoods on the line to report fraud. The IRS Whistleblower Program I shepherded through Congress has recouped $6 billion and counting. It’s a proven and effective tool to smoke out tax cheats whose underpayments force law-abiding taxpayers to pick up the slack. At a recent Senate Budget Committee hearing, I explained how good tax policy is a better approach to shrink the tax gap. Bad tax policies that increase complexity and undermine competitiveness for American companies do not grow revenue or shrink tax evasion. nav-mobile-modal search-mobile-modal',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON – Senate Judiciary Committee members Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.) introduced bipartisan legislation to strengthen penalties for smuggling contraband in federal prisons. The Lieutenant Osvaldo Albarati Stopping Prison Contraband Act would upgrade the charge for smuggling or possessing a contraband cellphone in federal prison from a misdemeanor to a felony. “Prisoners are increasingly using contraband cellphones to coordinate illegal activity from within correctional facilities. That’s an obvious safety risk to prison staff, other inmates and the public,” Grassley said. “Stemming the flow of contraband by stiffening the penalty for cellphone smuggling will go a long way to improve our federal prison system and keep the public safe.”\\xa0 “My bipartisan investigations of corruption, abuse, and misconduct in the Federal prison system have revealed systemic challenges that allow for the dangerous flow of contraband, which is a threat to safety and security,” Ossoff said. “Senator Grassley and I are introducing this bipartisan bill to strengthen penalties for smuggling contraband into Federal prisons.” “A cell phone in a prison is a deadly weapon. Yet, as our investigative work continues to demonstrate, contraband cell phones have proven to be pervasive inside many federal prisons, a reality that undermines the safety and security of these institutions for BOP staff, inmates, and the public. Lieutenant Albarati was a true hero, selflessly dedicated to making MDC Guaynabo and his community safer by preventing criminal activity inside the facility. I commend Senators Ossoff and Grassley for honoring his memory by sponsoring this public safety reform and for recognizing the severity of this problem,” Department of Justice (DOJ) Inspector General Michael Horowitz said. “By making the introduction of a cell phone into a prison a felony, as numerous states have already done, the Lieutenant Osvaldo Albarati Stopping Prison Contraband Act will allow investigators and prosecutors to more effectively bring to justice those introducing cell phones into prisons, curb the flow of illicit cell phones into prisons, make our communities and prisons safer, and help to save lives.” “Getting contraband cellphones out of prisons is very near and dear to my heart as I lost my husband – and my children lost their father – due to this. My husband was brutally murdered because he confiscated cell phones in a federal prison. And inmates used a contraband cellphone to put out a hit on him. Cell phones allow inmates to engage in and coordinate criminal activities both inside and outside the prison, including drug trafficking, extortion, violence, etc. I believe addressing this is crucial for the safety and security of our communities, and the employees of the Federal Bureau of Prisons,” Mrs. Helen Albarati, widow of Lt. Osvaldo Albarati said. The legislation is endorsed by the Council of Prison Locals and Voices of JOE. Download bill text HERE. Background: The Lieutenant Osvaldo Albarati Stopping Prison Contraband Act builds on the Grassley-Feinstein Cell Phone Contraband Act, which became law in 2010 designating cellphones as contraband in federal prison. Lieutenant Osvaldo Albarati, a Bureau of Prisons (BOP) correctional officer who was murdered in 2013 after completing his shift at the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) Guaynabo in Puerto Rico. Five men who later pleaded guilty to the crime admitted they targeted Albarati as a direct result of continuous seizures of contraband, including cellphones, by Albarati and other correctional officers. The inmate who placed the hit on Albarati did so using a contraband cellphone. A recent DOJ report from Inspector General Horowitz found nearly a third of deaths inBOP custody have occurred as a result of contraband, drugs or weapons. Grassley’s BOP Oversight: Grassley is a fierce advocate for transparency and accountability within the federal prison system. He is a cosponsor of the Federal Prisons Accountability Act to make the role of BOP Director – who’s responsible for overseeing a multi-billion-dollar budget – a Senate-confirmed position. Grassley’s oversight of the BOP has revealed serious allegations of abuse, document falsification and erroneous prisoner releases at Federal Correctional Complex (FCC) Hazelton in West Virginia and United States Penitentiary (USP) Thomson in Illinois. Grassley has personally met with the BOP Director to discuss efforts to root out staff misconduct in the federal prison system. -30- nav-mobile-modal search-mobile-modal',\n",

       " \"WASHINGTON – Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, today released a statement on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) permitting nationwide E15 sales this summer. The EPA's announcement follows a bipartisan push from Grassley and his colleagues. \\xa0 “This summertime waiver is good news and will preserve access to E15 in the immediate term. However, EPA’s tradition of issuing stopgap E15 authorizations must come to an end. There’s no reason to disrupt the industry by withholding year-round, nationwide E15,” Grassley said. “In fact, EPA has approved a petition to allow year-round E15 in Iowa and seven other Midwest states starting next year. But I’m hearing rumors the agency might delay implementation, and that better not be true. Such a delay would be a bait-and-switch by Biden bureaucrats on the drivers, retailers, farmers and refiners who are counting on uninterrupted E15 moving forward,” he continued.\\xa0\\xa0 Background:\\xa0 The EPA in February declared eight Midwestern states, including Iowa, can produce and sell E15 all year beginning in Spring 2025. Grassley has since pushed the agency to expedite the regulation’s implementation. Grassley and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) are spearheading a bill to permanently authorize the year-round, nationwide sale of ethanol blends higher than 10 percent, which would cut regulatory uncertainty out of the equation. Last year, he and Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) urged the Office of Management and Budget to act swiftly within its jurisdiction to lift market restrictions on ethanol. The Iowa lawmakers asserted doing so would strengthen U.S. energy security and reduce vehicle emissions.\\xa0 -30- nav-mobile-modal search-mobile-modal\",\n",

As prepared for delivery: “Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\xa0 Welcome Ambassador Tai. “I read the President’s trade agenda carefully.\\xa0 If we measured wisdom by word count alone, President Biden’s trade policy agenda would be wise.\\xa0 If we measured it in terms of creating meaningful opportunity for Americans, it is profoundly misguided—particularly in terms of its enforcement approach and negotiating ambitions. “This Administration’s enforcement record is the weakest of any Administration in 25 years.\\xa0 Although the Administration highlights regularly using the USMCA Rapid Response Labor Mechanism to help Mexican workers, that mechanism cannot supplant bringing cases to increase market openings for American workers. “Such cases are sorely lacking.\\xa0 USTR has yet to take a single enforcement action against China, period—whether at the WTO, or under section 301, or under the Phase 1 deal.\\xa0 Nothing.\\xa0\\xa0 “When it comes to discriminatory treatment, our trading partners now expect USTR to simply ‘note’ that it is ‘considering all options,’ as it did with Canada’s decision to move forward with discriminatory digital services taxes, and further expect that USTR’s ‘consideration of all options’ is likely to be indefinite.\\xa0 For example, USTR has not advanced our case against Mexico’s discriminatory energy policies for nearly two years now.\\xa0 “Administration plans for negotiations fare no better than they do for enforcement.\\xa0 For the fourth year in a row, the Administration’s trade agenda provides no plan for real negotiations to improve market access.\\xa0 “Instead, the Administration lauds the Inflation Reduction Act, asserting that our workers need to be shielded, subsidized and micromanaged through industrial policy, even if it entails massively expanding our national debt.\\xa0 “That is not only misguided, but as former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Michael Mullen noted, our debt is, in fact, one of the top national security threats to the United States.\\xa0 “What we need is market access.\\xa0 I recently traveled to Asia, the United Kingdom and to other partners. \\xa0Our partners want to make real deals with high standards. \\xa0They want to trade with us rather than China.\\xa0 And, they want to do it now.\\xa0 We should want that, too, because each day we wait is another that Americans fall back further behind our competitors, including China.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 “Make no mistake, tariffs matter, particularly for small businesses like our farmers.\\xa0 Australia and New Zealand each negotiated free trade agreements with Thailand, and, since then, demand for premium U.S. beef fell by 30 percent because our cattlemen face a 50 percent tariff while those two partners face none.\\xa0 “Whether it be Idaho potatoes and dairy, or Iowa soybeans and pork, or South Dakota wheat, or Texas cotton and beef, or Washington State apples—our farmers are the best in the world.\\xa0 This is precisely why a large number of farm groups wrote to you Ambassador Tai on Monday asking for a real trade agenda and advancing dispute settlement reform so we can open markets for them.\\xa0\\xa0 “United States manufacturing, innovation, creative and tech industries are second to none.\\xa0 If the Administration will not negotiate tariffs, it should at least help workers in these industries by negotiating critical rules on technical barriers to trade, intellectual property and key digital trade provisions such as on non-discrimination and free data flows.\\xa0 Thus far, USTR has failed to do so in any of the so-called framework negotiations—and the trade agenda indicates this will continue.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 “This benefits China, which is aggressively participating in international standards-setting bodies, pushing technology transfer and supporting data localization by countries, which could require our companies to store data on servers that are produced by Chinese companies such as Huawei, rather than on ones we host in the United States.\\xa0 “The proposals the Trump Administration crafted in coordination with this committee for USMCA for technical barriers to trade, for intellectual property and for digital trade ensured we could regulate and also rise to China’s challenge.\\xa0 Simply abandoning coordinated and reasoned proposals without consulting Congress—is a profound mistake.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 “I urge my colleagues, to remember when this Administration told us that comprehensive, congressionally approved trade agreements are a 20th century tool.\\xa0 Its vision of the future though is piecemeal frameworks done as executive agreements, devoid of any real enforcement mechanisms.\\xa0 “Ambassador Tai, the members of this Committee know that attempts to bypass Congress are neither new nor groundbreaking.\\xa0 And, they also know that such efforts are not sufficient or truly effective in creating the types of opportunities our citizens deserve.\\xa0 It is well past time this Administration begin working with Congress to meaningfully expand market access opportunities.” ###',\n",
       " 'Washington, D.C.--U.S. Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) delivered the following remarks at a hearing on the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) fiscal year 2025 budget and 2024 filling season with Commissioner Danny Werfel. \\xa0 As prepared for delivery: “Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and welcome again Commissioner Werfel. “The IRS needs to be accountable for the choices it makes, become more efficient, rigorously plan, provide full transparency and timely solicit real feedback from informed stakeholders—like Congress—before acting. “Despite claims that the $80 billion in new funding would ‘transform the IRS into a 21st century agency,’ the President’s budget request indicates otherwise. “While modest progress has been made, there are other areas where the agency continues to miss the mark. “For example, last year, I raised concerns with the IRS’ strategic operating plan, including its vagueness and missing line-item cost projections. “A year later, we are still missing important details, yet this year’s budget asks for even more unprecedented IRS funding—more than $104 billion. “This underscores that the initial windfall was not a cure, the IRS has not transformed, and the President believes the only way to realize that vision is to just spend more. “While I support a transformed IRS, this approach is not a solution. “For $80 billion, one would expect transformational customer service changes and fully modern front- and back-end IT.\\xa0 “Instead, it seems taxpayers have paid for mail to actually be opened and a decline in phone wait times.\\xa0 Meanwhile, several million items of taxpayer correspondence remain unanswered and half a million ID theft cases remain unresolved—on average, years later. “IT modernization funding is also scheduled to run out years before the IRS finishes updating its systems. “I assume this is due, in part, to the bulk of the IRA funding being directed to enforcement. “An emblematic example of the ‘just spend more, no questions asked’ approach is the Direct File program. “Despite there already being multiple free filing programs offered by the IRS, the agency embarked on a redundant government-run tax preparation project, complete with all attendant inefficiencies and conflicts-of-interest. “Just last week, a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report highlighted many ways the supposed pilot program has not followed best practices, including key planning, budgeting and accountability failures. “The report noted that while GAO could not determine how much the program has and will cost to develop and operate—the IRS having not provided sufficient information to do this—the current tab far exceeds $100 million just through FY 2024, all for an ‘option’ that might only serve 100,000 taxpayers this year. “In contrast, the federal government spends less than $5 million a year to have two to three million taxpayers served in one of its free income tax preparation programs. “Were the IRS to use this year’s Direct File spending to pay third-party providers to prepare and file returns instead, literally hundreds of times the number of taxpayers could file for free. “The IRS spending hundreds of millions of its finite funding to simply ‘test’ the utility of doing something that can already be done more efficiently, with better outcomes and without very real conflicts, while simultaneously pleading for more funding calls for more oversight. “Direct File is not my only concern with the IRS’ current path. “Other serious concerns include: continued IRS use of biased data and post-facto metrics to plan and justify its actions; indiscriminate IRS enforcement campaigns that pressure honest taxpayers and waste government resources; and the IRS’ continued—and highly disproportionate—focus on increasing enforcement over improving taxpayer services. “Commissioner Werfel, while I appreciate a handful of positive steps the IRS has taken during your tenure, so much remains undone at the IRS that any victory lap is unwarranted. “I look forward to your testimony, Commissioner Werfel.\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.” ###',\n",

On discriminatory digital services taxes:  Recently, when you were asked about discrimination against U.S. technology companies you said: “how many of these American companies are actually really American companies?” because they are “actually paying taxes there as opposed to paying taxes here…”\\xa0 Actually, those companies pay billions of dollars in taxes here, but they are paying more overseas—because of discriminatory digital services taxes.\\xa0  If you feel it is problematic that U.S. companies are paying more taxes overseas, will you then commit to this Committee that you will actually take action against DSTs rather than just consider it?\\xa0 And, if countries continue to move forward on implementation of their DSTs, will you take action? ###',\n",
       " 'Washington, D.C.--U.S. Senator Mike Crapo’s (R-Idaho) and Joe Manchin’s (D-West Virginia) bipartisan legislation to defund the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Rule designed to phase out of gas-powered cars and trucks in favor of electric vehicles (EV) received a vote in the U.S. Senate.\\xa0  “The EPA’s rule is the most aggressive form of tailpipe emissions standards ever crafted, and imposes a de facto EV mandate on the American people,” said Crapo. “These emissions standards go too far, and will restrict affordable vehicle choices for families, harm U.S. businesses, degrade our energy and national security and hand the keys of our automotive industry over to China--who currently dominates the entire EV supply chain and has no intention of reducing the carbon intensity of its economy any time soon.” To view Senator Crapo’s remarks, click HERE. On March 20, 2024, the EPA finalized its rule titled “Multi-Pollutant Emissions Standards for Model Year 2027 and Later Light-Duty and Medium-Duty Vehicles,” which sets stringent emissions standards for criteria pollutants and greenhouse gasses for these vehicles and is a de facto EV mandate.\\xa0 Under the rule, internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles--which still represent the overwhelming majority of new car sales--can make up no more than 30 percent of new sales by 2032.\\xa0 Last year, EVs made up less than eight percent of new car sales, while hybrids (including plug-ins) accounted for about nine percent of sales. Enactment of the bill, S. 4072, would have ensured that no Fiscal Year 2024 funds can be used to “implement, administer, or enforce” the EPA’s rule, or any substantially similar rule.\\xa0 Unfortunately, this legislation failed by a vote of 52 – 46 because a majority of Senate Democrats voted to allow continued funding for this aggressive mandate that effectively regulates gas-powered vehicles out of the U.S. market. ###',\n",

       " '(As prepared for delivery) \\xa0 Ambassador Tai, welcome back to the Committee. You’re joining us in a time of great progress and potential. 15 million jobs have been created under President Biden, wages continue to rise, and unemployment has been under 4% for the longest span in decades. Our economic success has defied expectations. I saw a headline in the Wall Street Journal that read, and I quote, “Envy of the World—U.S. Economy Expected to Keep Powering Higher.” \\xa0 Putting workers and their families first made this possible. We’re building an economy from the bottom-up and the middle-out, putting weight to the phrase “Made in America”. Through targeted investments, we’ve supercharged domestic manufacturing and improved supply chain resiliency, all while creating millions of jobs. For years to come these successes will continue to unfold, but in the meantime, we can return to our roots as a maritime nation. Bolstering our commercial shipping industry with a comprehensive strategy to expand the sector and grow the workforce is the next frontier for Making it in America, and I look forward to working together on this.  \\xa0 Our investment in combatting climate change, which is the largest in our nation’s history, is already ushering in hundreds of thousands of new, good-paying jobs, and spreading green investment across the country. The success of late has shown just how interconnected workers’ rights, environmental protections, and a growing economy are. Ensuring that our trade policies support our values is critical, and I’m grateful for your leadership in what will be a lasting shift from the trade policy of yesterday to the Biden Administration’s worker-first agenda. \\xa0 \\xa0 As our nation’s lead trade negotiator, you have fought to ensure that America’s workers and businesses have the tools they need to compete in today’s global economy and strengthened our relationships with our allies across the world. Most recently, at the World Trade Organization’s MC13, securing an agreement on the e-commerce moratorium and making welcome progress on fish subsidies.  \\xa0 Robustly enforcing our trade agreement is another way you’ve put workers at the center of our trade policy. With USMCA standing as the beacon for what’s possible, labor and environmental protections are no longer additions on top of an agreement, but now the very foundation of any agreement.  \\xa0 I credit much of this progress to the work and consensus-building of Congress. The collaboration between Congress and the Executive is necessary for the success of trade policy. Only through this collaboration can durable, enforceable agreements be created, and can trade policy live up to its fullest potential. There’s no better recent example than the Taiwan trade legislation signed into law last year. It is on this dais that the Congress expands economic ties and stands up for workers around the world, and together, we will continue using trade as a powerful driver for good-paying jobs and a thriving economy. \\xa0 \\xa0 We are up against strong forces that threaten our progress. Whether it be Putin’s unprovoked war on Ukraine or China’s nonmarket practices, or even the Republican nominee’s interest in purposely weakening the dollar. Amidst these challenges, we’ve seen unparalleled unity with our allies, and I look forward to working together on capitalizing on this momentum to deepen our economic connections, particularly in Africa, the Caribbean, and Europe. \\xa0 We’ve seen what’s possible with values-based trade policy, and when we work together, guided by doing what’s right for the people, we can spread opportunity and prosperity. Ambassador, thank you for joining us today, I yield back the balance of my time. \\xa0 ###',\n",
       " '(As prepared for delivery) \\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. \\xa0 Before I begin, this week, an esteemed member of the Ways and Means Staff will head to the Biden Administration to lead textile negotiations for the United States Trade Representative. Katherine White has been a dedicated and diligent staffer, and her work on the frontlines of negotiating USMCA make her the perfect pick for this role. Katie, you will be greatly missed, and we wish you all the best in this next chapter.  \\xa0 Now turning to today’s markup. Sadly, today is another rushed, partisan markup of do-nothing, unvetted legislation that had there been a real negotiation could’ve been bipartisan.  \\xa0 The Ways and Means Committee has a long tradition of bipartisanship, particularly on trade. When Putin launched his unprovoked war on Ukraine, this Committee quickly worked together to suspend normal trading relations. We’ve worked together on several iterations of legislation to strengthen our relationship with Taiwan. Not only can it be done again, but it should.  \\xa0 To seriously legislate, there must be a real desire for bipartisanship, and putting in the time to send proposals back and forth, seek proper consultation from the many stakeholders, and ultimately, the will to compromise. It always helps to have a pathway into law, which none of these bills have. \\xa0 Many of the issues before us today are ripe for action, and Democrats have a demonstrated interest, but changing text less than 24 hours before this markup and announcing your changes publicly in a hearing isn’t how you win our support.  \\xa0 For anyone who has seen the bill names today, you may be fooled into thinking this slate of bills is tough on China. Let me tell you though, you can’t only talk tough. The Majority affords the ability to legislate tough and today’s legislation falls far short of what the American people need.  \\xa0 The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program was conceived as a bipartisan, developmental trade program, and I’ve long said that I want to reauthorize GSP, but it must be done with the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program. Recently, this committee had a major bipartisan accomplishment on tax, which can be unheard of, but it was possible because we paired what my Republican colleagues wanted for business with what we wanted for workers and families. The same approach could’ve been applied here. Yet this bill is a weak façade for retroactive handouts to corporations with no meaningful consideration given to workers.  \\xa0 Ahead of this markup, I heard from mothers who have lost children to Fentanyl ordered from China and transported by public and private domestic shipping channels right to their homes. And just yesterday, the select China Committee released their report showing that China is actually fueling this crisis. How can the Majority consider their de minimis legislation ready for primetime when it fails to address this? Or what about the influx of gun silencers making their way into Americans’ hands from China?  These are major public safety concerns, and we have the power to do something.  \\xa0 We are also living through a pivotal moment for American workers. As companies continue to notch record profits, our workers are reclaiming their rightful place in our economy. Our unions are strong, wages are up, and workers are fighting for the benefits they deserve.  \\xa0 For years, our workers have been asking us to reauthorize TAA, and I just learned of a few new plants closing in districts of members on this Committee. When all you care about is the success and will of big business, you ignore those voices and realities, and can only muster lip-service to workers.  \\xa0 I am pleased that there seems to be some movement from my colleagues on the Inflation Reduction Act. I believe today marks the first time that instead of repealing the legislation, they are attempting to influence its implementation. It’s hard to argue with over 270,000 jobs and 520 projects across 47 states and Puerto Rico in less than two years. In President Biden’s time in office, we’ve made unprecedented strides in tackling climate change while growing the clean energy economy.  \\xa0 The Inflation Reduction Act turbocharged our EV and critical minerals supply chains, bolstering domestic manufacturing. Treasury’s proposed guidance strikes the proper balance between building out our emerging electric vehicle (EV) market and strengthening our energy security while encouraging diverse and resilient global supply chains. Since President Biden took office, EV sales have more than quadrupled, with over 4.5 million EVs on our roads. \\xa0 Try as they might, shouting China won’t distract the American people from the Majority’s inability to legislate. We are on the precipice of another motion to vacate the Republican Speaker, and today’s slate of legislation is nothing more than a veneer on getting tough on China by a group that actually has the ability to be tough. \\xa0 With that, I yield back the balance of my time.  \\xa0 ###',\n",

We’ve built the strongest economy in the world, and the next step is ensuring American workers and businesses have the tools they need to compete in the global economy. Today’s news that the Biden Administration is launching an investigation into China’s unfair practices in the maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding industries is another proof point that President Biden puts American workers first and even more evidence of the strength of labor in moving these critical conversations forward. \\xa0 “This announcement underlies the importance of creating the national shipbuilding strategy I called for earlier this year, which will help grow our economy and bolster our national security. America’s history as an economic superpower started on the high seas, and President Biden has made it clear that bringing the shipbuilding sector and the good-paying jobs it creates back to our shores is the next step to investing in America.

       " 'Hard-line\\xa0House Republicans\\xa0are coming out in strong opposition to House Speaker\\xa0Mike Johnson‘s (R-LA) four-pronged\\xa0foreign aid\\xa0package, particularly over a stipulation in the\\xa0Ukraine\\xa0aid bill that the loan can be canceled by the president in a few years — a move that some are calling a “joke.” Johnson’s long-awaited four-bill foreign aid package, for which text was\\xa0released\\xa0on Wednesday, includes aid to Ukraine, Israel, and the Indo-Pacific, all in separate bills. As part of the Ukraine bill, nearly $7.9 billion will be provided to Ukraine under the “Economic Support Fund,” and nearly $1.57 billion will be provided for “Assistance for Europe, Eurasia, and Central Asia” to Ukraine and other countries. A breakdown of the package from the speaker’s office and House Appropriations Committee touts Ukraine aid as a “loan” and says the legislation “mandates agreement on repayment for economic support by the government of Ukraine.” However, buried in\\xa0the text\\xa0is a section that stipulates that the president can cancel up to 50% of the loan after Nov. 15, 2024, with congressional review. After Jan. 1, 2026, any remaining debt can be canceled. The bill itself, as well as the loan repayment, angered some House GOP members who believe the United States won’t see any money return. “I think it’s a joke,” Rep. Tim Burchett (R-TN) said to the\\xa0Washington Examiner. “They’re not gonna pay us any money. We’re gonna rebuild that country afterwards, probably, or part of it.” He added that he thinks several House Republicans are going to vote for the Ukraine bill and use the loan to “justify it.” Rep. Scott Perry (R-PA) said in a\\xa0post\\xa0to X that the loan for Ukraine is “all smoke and mirrors” and blasted the president’s ability to cancel 50% of the loan by this November, adding that “no bank would allow this.” The passage of Ukraine aid could cost Johnson his speakership, as Rep.\\xa0Marjorie Taylor Greene\\xa0(R-GA) continues to hold her motion to vacate, which she filed last month, over his head. She previously said how Johnson handled Ukraine aid and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act reauthorization would dictate how she moves forward with the motion to vacate. “Monday was Tax Day. So as Americans were paying their hard-earned tax dollars to this government, the Republican speaker, hinging his entire ability to stay speaker on sending $64 million to Ukraine — I can’t think of a worse betrayal ever to happen in the United States history,” Greene told reporters on Thursday. The decision to include debt cancelation is a sign that House GOP leadership is putting some distance between the foreign aid package and former President Donald Trump’s demands over how to handle Ukraine aid, as it becomes more clear that Johnson needs bipartisan support to push his four-pronged plan over the finish line. Trump, who has shown several times his\\xa0influence stretches over the House GOP, said during a meeting with Johnson last week that Republicans should push for making additional aid to Ukraine “in the form of a loan rather than a gift.” In a post to Truth Social on Thursday, he blasted the United States for its financial involvement in the country’s war against Russia compared to other nations. “Why isn’t Europe giving more money to help Ukraine? Why is it that the United States is over $100 Billion Dollars into the Ukraine War more than Europe, and we have an Ocean between us as separation! Why can’t Europe equalize or match the money put in by the United States of America in order to help a Country in desperate need?” the former president\\xa0said. During a press conference on Wednesday, Johnson said that adding the loan forgiveness provision might be a “very important chip in a game” down the road, such as brokering a peace deal. “That might be an important thing to have, an important option for the president to have, and I think that makes sense to\\xa0Republicans\\xa0and\\xa0Democrats,” Johnson said. “We would want the Commander-in-Chief to make those decisions, and then Congress, of course, has oversight over all of it, so I think it’s a good policy.” President Joe Biden came out in strong support for Johnson’s foreign aid package on Wednesday, calling on the House and Senate to pass the bills and stating he would sign it into law “immediately.” The ability to cancel up to 50% of the economic support loan to Ukraine is a win for Democrats and Biden, who has made loan cancellation for student debt a key component of his presidency and his reelection campaign. Just days after the election in November, Biden would be able to forgive half of the U.S.’s loan to\\xa0Ukraine. Rep. Bob Good (R-VA) also called the loan forgiveness a “joke,” adding “it’s not real.” “First of all, the bill as it’s written gives Biden the ability to waive 50% of it anyway,” Good said to reporters on Wednesday. “This is the guy who wants to waive all\\xa0student loans\\xa0— why wouldn’t he waive Ukraine’s loan? And you know, we got a long list of nations who haven’t paid us back money that was supposedly loaned to them, so.” Some Republicans in the Senate are not too pleased with the framework of Johnson’s Ukraine aid bill, as well. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) told the\\xa0Washington Examiner\\xa0he thought the loan idea was a “little gimmicky.” “And maybe I don’t understand it well enough,” Hawley said. “So, I’ll try to do my homework here, but I don’t know — if they can repay the loan, would they be asking for the money? I mean, they’re not going to repay it.” “You may as well just call it what it is, which is an outlay. I mean, it’s just spending,” the\\xa0Missouri\\xa0senator added. “But, again, maybe I’m missing some profound nuance.” The\\xa0Washington Examiner\\xa0reached out to Trump for comment.',\n",

Click here to watch Kudlow, here for The Lead On the supplemental national security package: What we've done is we've taken the senate supplemental bill, and we've improved the process and the policy, and that's a really important thing. What we've done for example, in the Ukraine piece of this, is we've added the loan instrument concept, we've added the REPO Act - which everybody knows is the seizure of corrupt Russian oligarchs’ assets - to be used to fund the effort in Ukraine. We introduced a lot of new accountabilities and oversight. The Congress has a responsibility to do and the strategy shift as well. We're going to require within 45 days, the White House to deliver to Congress a meaningful plan. What is the endgame here? What's the objective and how are we going to accomplish this and bring this conflict to an end? By the way Larry, on Ukraine, 80% of what we'll spend here goes to America's industrial defense base, and that's a replenishment of our stocks and weapons. And I think that's a really important point. We're also adding sanctions against Russia and Iran and all our adversaries including China, and that's a really important thing as well. So, the House will do its will and have a rigorous amendment process to the underlying legislation. On the urgent need to support U.S. allies: You got to be tough on your adversaries. The problem is you and I both know, Larry, this President is projecting weakness on the world stage and that's why all our nation's enemies are acting so provocatively. On the Israel example, I mean, President Biden and Chuck Schumer had been criticizing Israel and appeasing Iran, that strategy should be exactly the opposite. We should be helping Israel and they've been turning their backs on them. And then of course, this encourages Xi and encourages China, when they see that we're not going to stand strong and we're not going to put the flag in the ground so to speak and hold the line. They're going to act, they're going to move, and we're concerned about what China may do in Taiwan. We talk about it all the time. We're certainly concerned about Iran's open aggression now against Israel, our dear friend and ally. And Russia, of course, is still on the march in Ukraine. We must stand strong. A strong America is good for the entire world. We bring stability and peace – the perception that America is strong is important and has been since World War II and we cannot let down that responsibility. On border security: Some of my colleagues want the Speaker of the House to have a magic wand. If we could close the border ourselves, we would have done it a long time ago. We passed HR 2 over a year ago, it's sitting on Chuck Schumer's desk. That had all the components. It closes the border, changes asylum processes and problems, ends catch and release and in reinstates remain in Mexico. All the things that President Trump had done so effectively, Biden reflexively did the opposite. And that's been the problem. We pass resolutions, we pass the laws, they sit on Chuck Schumer's desk in the Senate because again, the Democrats run the Senate, the Democrats run the White House, and they want an open border. That voter ID, the idea that you would have to prove that you're a US citizen to vote in a US election, a federal election, is critically important. We're going to move that in the days ahead as well. That's what we were talking about at Mar a Lago at the press conference. But the American people demand this, they deserve it. We know the border is a catastrophe. And the reason that we're bringing to the floor this week, the End the Border Catastrophe Act, is because it's aptly named. And it describes what is on the hearts and minds of every single American. It doesn't matter where you live. I've been in 23 states in the last seven or eight weeks Larry traveling around the country. It doesn't matter whether I'm out west, upstate New York, deep south, Midwest, it's all the same. Everybody knows, this is what we must do. If you don't have a secure border, you don't have sovereignty; you don't have security. You don't even really have a nation. And that's what Joe Biden has put at risk. And that's why we had to impeach Mayorkas. On President Biden’s weakness: I think this sets up the next election, the next administration, the next president, and I believe [Trump is] going to win - in a better position. I think that President Trump is strong enough that he could enter the world stage and broker a peace deal in Ukraine, if Russia is still advancing at that time. I mean, I think he has the strong enough hand to be able to do that. And that's why this election is so important. There's a very stark contrast - you know we didn't have all these global conflicts. We didn't have hot wars around the globe when Donald Trump was the president. You know why? Because our adversaries feared him and respected. They don't fear and respect Joseph Biden. And that's a real problem for all of us. On the motion to vacate: I'm not asking the Democrats to get involved in that I believe the house will do as well. Look, I'm trying to govern and lead this institution at a very interesting, unprecedented time. We have challenges right now that no previous generation has faced. Newt Gingrich posted a few days ago on social media. The speaker’s job is effectively impossible. Now he said that I'm doing the hardest job that maybe it has ever been in the history of the U.S. House. Maybe, he said, arguably since the Civil War. Why because we live in a very divided time and very divisive politics in the age of social media. 24-hour news cycle, where everybody can express their opinions every moment of the day but things they’re disgruntled about. It makes a lot of challenges, but we're going to get through this. Listen, we are the greatest nation in the history of the world. Okay, we are going to show that we're going to keep the train on the tracks and not get derailed and get involved in all of this. It's such a dangerous time on the world stage and that look, I don't walk around thinking about the motion to vacate. It's a procedural matter here that I think it's been abused in recent times. Maybe at some point we change. Right now, I’ve got to do my job. And so do all my colleagues. And I'm confident at the end of the day, in spite of all the drama, and all the palace intrigue, I think we're gonna get that done.\",\n",
       " \"WASHINGTON\\xa0—\\xa0On Wednesday, Speaker Johnson announced the House response to the Senate’s national security supplemental legislation. This legislation is comprised of four separate bills and provides resources to Israel, Ukraine, and the Indo-Pacific, as well as measures to counter adversaries in each region. “This legislation also includes enhanced oversight and accountability of U.S. taxpayer resources and includes upgrades to the Senate bill like the REPO Act and transferring portions of Ukraine aid into a loan. What we’ve done is taken the Senate supplemental bill, and we’ve improved the process and the policy, and that’s a really important thing,” Speaker Johnson said. Conservatives, faith leaders, advocacy organizations strongly support the legislation: “AIPAC strongly suppots Speaker Johnson’s work to bring important national security bills to the floor, and we urge every House member to vote for crucial security aid to our ally Israel,” — \\xa0AIPAC. “The Israel Supplemental Appropriations Act provides critical support to a key ally facing our common enemy, Iran. This is especially true now that Iran has attacked Israel directly, not just through proxies. We call upon all Members of Congress to support the rule & the bill,” — Coalition for Jewish Values. “We urge all members to support the rule allowing the foreign aid bill to come to the floor so we can deliver critical emergency military assistance to Israel. Don’t tell us you stand with Israel, show us,” — Christians United for Israel. “In the aftermath of the October 7th Hamas massacre and Iran’s direct attack against Israel’s homeland, these votes are an especially critical test of support for the US-Israel alliance. The time to act is now,” — Republican Jewish Coalition. “We welcome the release of the House of Representatives' security supplemental package, which includes a number of vital measures that AJC has long advocated for, such as security assistance to our allies Israel and Ukraine, and funding for the Nonprofit Security Grant Program to keep Jewish communities in the U.S. safe. We urge its swift passage,” — American Jewish Committee. “It is absolutely critical that Christians in America and around the world stand with Israel, protect Israel's right to defend itself, and work to contain this conflict so that it doesn't threaten global peace. We stand with Israel,” — Family Research Council. “The leadership of Speaker Mike Johnson has been crucial in defending life, religious freedom, fiscal responsibility, and important allies like Israel. He always stands strong and we're proud to stand with him,” — Center for Urban Renewal. “As former Secretary of State and former Vice Chief of Staff of the Army we write at a pivotal moment in our nation’s history to applaud your efforts to secure vital support to America’s allies and to strengthen America’s defenses,” — Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo & Vice Chief of Staff to the Army Jack Keane. “Speaker Mike Johnson is a man of incredible character, who has unequivocally shown his support of protecting the unborn, the family, and standing strong with one of our greatest allies, Israel. In light of Iran’s unprecedented attack against Israel last week, we must ensure that every Republican is supportive of the Speaker’s efforts to bring Israel funding to the finish line as quickly as possible. CWALAC supports Speaker Johnson and his efforts to support Israel,” — Concerned Women for America LAC. “Last week, the ERLC sent a letter to Speaker Johnson & all members of Congress urging them to pass critical support for Ukraine. While there are some political headwinds, I’m grateful Mike Johnson is moving forward to help Ukraine defend itself against Putin’s illegal invasion,” — Brent Leatherwood, Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission President. “This supplemental package includes bills that the CCP, Russia, and the Islamic Republic of Iran all vehemently oppose, it will be devastating to our enemies if this passes,” — POLARIS. “A resilient U.S. DIB and a strong network of U.S. allies and partners form the foundation of U.S. national deterrence in a rapidly evolving strategic environment. On behalf of NDIA’s members, I commend the House leadership for supporting these necessary investments and urge swift passage,” — David Norquist, National Defense Industry Association President. “The bill to force China to divest from TikTok may soon be on the President’s desk. Thank you Speaker Johnson for your leadership,” — Foundation for American Innovation. “FDD Action endorses the supplemental funding package put forward today by Speaker Mike Johnson. We urge members of Congress on both sides of the aisle to support it along with the underlying rule. America’s adversaries are watching. The authoritarian axis of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Russia, and the Chinese Communist Party are challenging U.S. interests like never before. It is imperative that both chambers of the Congress act with urgency to provide critical support to Israel, Taiwan, and Ukraine. These nations are on the front lines of a generation-defining fight for freedom and prosperity, and their success is inextricably linked to our own national security. This legislation paves the way for targeted investments with strong oversight in our allies and partners that will enhance their military capabilities, deter America’s adversaries, and contain the spread of even costlier conflicts,” — Foundation for Defense of Democracies Action. “In supporting U.S. assistance to Ukraine, Israel, and allies in the Indo-Pacific, Speaker Johnson channels President Ronald Reagan. Speaking to Congress in 1985, President Reagan declared, ‘We must stand by all our democratic allies. And we must not break faith with those who are risking their lives,’” — Ronald Reagan Institute. “We should all call our congressmen and urge them to pass aid to stop Putin, to help Israel, to strengthen Taiwan and to close the border. I am especially glad that the REPO act has been included to use Russian money to pay for defeating Putin,” — Former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich. “America is the leader of the free world and I would call on all my old friends in the Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, to rally around Speaker Johnson as he brings legislation to the floor to do America’s part to renew our support for Ukraine, for Israel, for Taiwan, and for freedom in the world,” — Former Vice President Mike Pence.\",\n",
       " \"My first and most important job is serving you. Here are some ways I can help. Congressman Rob Wittman (R-VA), vice chairman of the House Armed Services Committee and chairman of the Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee, held a\\xa0subcommittee hearing\\xa0to review the fiscal year 2025 budget request for the Department of Defense’s fixed-wing tactical and training aircraft programs. “While our focus remains on the National Defense Strategy, which prioritizes China as our primary threat, I'm concerned about the lack of clarity in defining our tactical fighter force structure and capabilities,”\\xa0said Chairman Wittman.\\xa0“The persistent decrease in fighter force structure and the challenge of delivering affordable replacement aircraft are alarming. Additionally, uncertainties persist in aircraft procurement quantities for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps, particularly regarding the F-35 program. Despite the F-35's promise as the most advanced fighter aircraft, we must expedite TR-3 hardware and Block 4 software deployment to address ongoing challenges.” \\n(Watch the full hearing) The hearing addressed the clarity and direction of the U.S. military's currently declining tactical fighter force structure, particularly in light of the National Defense Strategy's emphasis on China as a pacing threat. The subcommittee heard testimony from: Chairman Wittman:\\xa0\\xa0\\n “We understand the need to modernize. The key is, we always go through these transitions where we get rid of existing platforms, regardless of their limitations and capabilities and things that they can and cannot do for the promise of new capability somewhere out in the future. And I tell folks ‘All of our dreams come through outside the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP).’ ... We have got to find a way to get those curves to intersect as far as retiring older capability [and] bringing online newer capability. It always seems like there's a bathtub there we have to swim in for years.\\n “I know we've had a lot of conversations about F-35, TR-3. It was bitterly disappointing to myself, and other committee members, that we had to learn of another shift to the right to Q3, not directly from the contractor, but from an earnings call.\\n “Can you give us your perspective on how you see the path forward? Because the F-35 is it. We are all in on this aircraft. It has to perform. The capabilities that TR-3 brings to the table are necessary and it has to occur at the speed of relevance.\\n “I'm not looking to place blame. I think everybody is part of this. Congress has to be part of this as far as not just understanding what happened, but what the solution is going forward. How do you see things going forward to make sure we get back to where we need to be?”\\n Lt. Gen. Schmidt:\\xa0\\n “Honestly, sir, I am getting tired of over-promising and under-delivering, and I need to change that narrative. All that said, just saying it's going to take longer is not going to be satisfying and all the things we talked about earlier with a true digital infrastructure, being a state-of-the-art program for literally the biggest fighter program in the world. It would be unacceptable to be anything else. But I don't feel like that's where we are today. The discussions from industry are all we can do in the future on future programs. There is no future program that is bigger than this program. And so, getting after the development side is the thing that bothers me the most every single day. And those are the things that we're trying to do about it, but I need some help from industry, sir.”\\xa0\\n Chairman Wittman:\\xa0\\n “I think things are finally starting to move in the right direction. I appreciate your assertion that we have to have the best on your team there at the Joint Program Office. I appreciate the conversation we had a few days ago to give Lockheed credit that they're saying we're going to make sure we bring subject matter experts across the enterprise because there are other aspects of what Lockheed does that use digital twin technology, that use digital design, that use advanced methods to make sure that we develop systems at the speed of relevance to make sure you get information quickly into comparison computer models to make sure we make those software upgrades. Those are things that have to happen.\\xa0\\n “Lockheed has made the commitment to do that … the key now is execution.\\n “I tell folks, ‘We can talk all about the ground that we've already plowed and talk about how we got here. But the key is, what are we going to do on the path forward?...’I do want to ask the next step forward, so as we begin to deliver these TR-3 configured aircraft, are you confident as to when they are delivered as to where they will be operationally? And will there be additional things that need to be done in the interim, actually get them to be combat coded? Because the thought is when they first come in, they may not be a combat coded status. It looks to me, it may take 12-16 months to get them from the early stages of TR-3 to actually being able to fly within that combat configuration.”\\n Lt. Gen. Schmidt:\\xa0\\n “There are certain capabilities that will not be available in the truncated version of the TR-3 software and you're probably right about the 12 to 16 months. We're looking at everything we can to try to figure out what [we can] move left in that, but that is an accurate assessment, sir, that for a couple of the capabilities that our warfighters feel are required to be fully combat capable they will not be there at the truncation, sir.”\\n Chairman Wittman:\\xa0\\n “I think one of the aspects of this also with NGAD is not just understanding what the future threat scenario would be and what the future countermeasures will be by our adversaries to try to overcome whatever technology would bring to the table, but also to look at [options] like CCA. I think CCA holds a lot of promise for the current aircraft and F-35. As we know, it's meant to be in ancillary, not in place of — but give us your perspective. We talk about the current scenario now moving it to the left getting it out there quickly. But as we advance that particular platform, give me your perspective on what it does to the capability of NGAD.”\\n Mr. Hunter:\\xa0\\n “Our collaborative combat aircraft program is part of the NGAD family system, so it's very much envisioned to be a complementary capability that helps NGAD perform its mission. Having said that, we anticipate, or we project, and we are budgeting towards, fielding of collaborative combat aircraft on a faster time frame. So it is not just NGAD that they would be teaming with. Also, other Air Force systems and joint systems like the F-35.”\\n Chairman Wittman:\\xa0\\n “Do you think what we learn by fielding CCA faster will provide more capability and capacity for NGAD?”\\n Mr. Hunter:\\xa0\\n “Absolutely. It's leveraging that same architecture, that same industry-based partner. It allows us to exercise fielding of technology in a way that will definitely be supportive of us doing the same thing with NGAD.”\\n ###\",\n",

       " \"Brooklyn, NY – Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries issued the following statement upon the news of the death of Congressman Donald M. Payne, Jr.:Today is a difficult day as we mourn the loss of a beloved public servant, colleague and dear friend. Over his six terms in Congress, Representative Donald M. Payne, Jr. was a tremendous advocate for the people of New Jersey’s Tenth Congressional District, following in the footsteps of his father, the first African American Member of Congress from the state.Rep. Donald Payne, Jr.’s long and valiant career in public service began when he founded the Newark South Ward Junior Democrats and continued at the Municipal Council of Newark and Essex County Board of Freeholders, always fighting for those he was privileged to represent. Don led this fight with vigorous passion and personal conviction, his own courageous battle with Type 1 Diabetes informing much of his life’s work to make our communities safer and healthier. Don Payne Jr. was a strong supporter of the Affordable Care Act and an outspoken advocate for men’s health, leading efforts to provide accessible screening and treatment options for cancer patients.As Chairman of the Railroad Subcommittee for the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Congressman Payne was instrumental in fighting for critical upgrades to New Jersey’s transit system and in crafting the historic Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that has strengthened our nation. A Member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, Don passed legislation to protect America’s children and to make DHS communication more effective during emergencies.Don leaves behind a legacy of relentless determination in the face of adversity. Our nation is forever indebted to Rep. Payne, Jr. for his service and commitment to his community, to the Congress and to the country. I am grateful to my classmate and friend for the role he played in my own public service journey, through our conversations on train rides to and from Washington and our close partnership as Members from neighboring delegations.\\xa0I join the entire House Democratic Caucus in expressing our sincere condolences to Don’s wife Beatrice, his children Donald III, Jack and Yvonne and the entire Payne family.  ### Subscribe to our e-newsletter that provides updates\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ton important issues, my work in the Congress and what's\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thappening in our district.\",\n",

They’re expected to run for their lives and stay home from class.” \\xa0 WASHINGTON\\xa0—\\xa0Today, Speaker Johnson joined the Hugh Hewitt Show ahead of his meeting with Jewish students at Columbia University to discuss the troubling rise of virulent antisemitism on American college campuses. \\xa0 Click here to listen to the full interview \\xa0 On the Speaker’s visit to Columbia:  \\xa0 What we’re seeing on these college campuses across the country is disgusting and unacceptable. And we have to – every leader in this country, every political official, every citizen of good conscience – has to speak out and say that this is not who we are in America, and we got to have accountability and that’s what my colleagues and I are going to be working on.\\xa0 \\xa0 On the national rise of antisemitism: \\xa0 We have Jewish students who have actually been physically assaulted, they’ve been harassed and been intimidated and threatened. What we need to be doing is, \\xa0I love the clip from Tom Cotton. My friend Tom said before your break, we need to revoke federal funding to these universities that they cannot keep control. We need to revoke these student visas for these violent protesters. You don’t have a right to be here and to do this, but Jewish students have a right to be able to peacefully attend classes. \\xa0 They’re trying to get an education, and this is just madness. And you know, I’ve seen some of these man on the street interviews with some of these kids who are protesting. You and I both know the vast majority of them have no idea what they’re talking about. They don’t know the facts. Some of them are denying that October 7 even happened. I mean, it’s just ridiculous. And we’re calling upon and demanding these university officials to get control. This situation is just completely out of control right now. \\xa0 On Democrats failure to counter antisemitism in their party: \\xa0 I’ll tell you that the real problem we have right now is that we’re not getting strong leadership, obviously from the White House or even some Democrats in Congress. I mean, the White House is caving to the antisemitic, I call it the pro-Hamas wing of the party. Now they backpedaled on their support for Israel. I mean, if you get members of Congress refusing to denounce even the chants of death to America, they just go silent. They won’t call that out and some members, Democratic members of Congress, are even calling these antisemitic mobs peaceful protesters and defending the harassment, intimidation and all the rest. So it’s really become a serious problem. And they’re allowing mob rule to overtake the American ideals of free speech and the free exchange of ideas and in the free exercise of religion. This is not who we are. \\xa0 On the national security supplemental: \\xa0 I know that history is going to judge this well. It was the right thing to do. This is a this is a very dangerous time. We truly do have a new Axis of Evil. You have China, Russia, and Iran, and often North Korea working together in coordination. They’re funding one another’s aggression. And the reason you and I both know, and you highlight this all the time, the reason this is happening is because the current president is projecting weakness on the world stage and our adversaries are acting aggressively and provocatively, and taking advantage of that. \\xa0 So, we had this moment in time, Hugh, this historic question: would America stand by our allies stand by Israel, the beleaguered people of Ukraine in this pivotal moment? Or would we shrink back and, in my view, abdicate our obvious responsibility and role in the world? I don’t believe we need to be the world’s policeman. I don’t believe that is our burden. But I do believe that the perception of a strong America is essential on the world stage. And I think the Congress has acted to make sure that happens. \\xa0 ### \\n\\nTags: \\n Tweet\\n Share\\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tH-232, The Capitol\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWashington, D.C. 20515\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t202-225-4000\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t ©2024 U.S. House of Representatives.

       " 'Today, U.S. Congressman Henry Cuellar, Ph.D. (TX-28) celebrated the Senate passage of his bill renaming the Del Mar Post Office in Laredo after local, fallen military heroes Lance Corporal David Lee Espinoza, Lance Corporal Juan Rodrigo Rodriguez, and Sergeant Roberto Arizola, Jr. The legislation now heads to the President’s Desk, where it will be signed into law. “Lance Corporal David Lee Espinoza, Lance Corporal Juan Rodrigo Rodriguez, and Sergeant Roberto Arizola, Jr. paid the ultimate sacrifice in preserving our freedom, and renaming the Del Mar Post Office here in Laredo will forever commemorate their selfless efforts,” said Dr. Cuellar. “Yesterday, the Senate unanimously voted to memorialize these South Texas heroes and ensure their legacy lives on. Thank you to Texas Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz for working with me to get this legislation through the Senate and the entire Texas Congressional delegation for cosponsoring the bill.” “When my son, David, was killed in Kabul in August 2021, Congressman Cuellar immediately reached out to our family to see how he could help. Not only did we receive his full emotional support, he also helped us get a home where David’s brothers and sister could grow up,” said Elizabeth Holguin, mother of Lance Corporal David Lee Espinoza. “Nothing will ever bring my son back. However, my family and I are honored to have the post office display David’s name in his honor. Thank you, Congressman Cuellar, for passing this bill to honor David\\'s memory.” \"My family and I thank Congressman Cuellar for passing this bill for my brother. It is a great honor knowing his name will forever be remembered as a hero,” said Ricardo Arizola, brother of Sergeant Roberto Arizola, Jr.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 “My son was a selfless human being who lived to serve others and his community. After his military term was up, he wanted to come home and join the local police department,” said Juana Maria Rodriguez, mother of Lance Corporal Juan Rodrigo Rodriguez. “May this post office now embody my son’s values of honor, service, and sense of duty. Thank you, Congressman Cuellar, for helping us pay tribute to Juan’s ultimate sacrifice.” Lance Corporal David Lee Espinoza was born on July 10, 2001, in Laredo, Texas, but lived in nearby Rio Bravo, Texas, all his life. He graduated from Lyndon B. Johnson High School in 2019. Shortly after graduating, he joined the United States Marine Corps. On August 26, 2021, during the withdrawal from Afghanistan, Lance Corporal Espinoza was one of 13 service members killed by a suicide bombing in Kabul, Afghanistan. He was 20 years old. Lance Corporal Juan Rodrigo Rodriguez lived in El Cenizo, a town near Laredo, where he attended United South High School and was involved in Junior ROTC.

       " ' Last week, the Palisades Nuclear Power Plant in Covert received a $1.52 billion conditional loan commitment from the Department of Energy to restart operations in 2025. This is great news! I’ve led the bipartisan charge in Congress behind this historic project because it will bring economic opportunity, lower energy costs, and greater energy security for Southwest Michigan.  Repowering Palisades means bringing 800 megawatts of safe, reliable, carbon-free energy generation for more than 800,000 homes - and hundreds of highly skilled, good-paying jobs right here to Michigan’s Fourth Congressional District.  According to Market Van Buren’s Zach Morris, “we’re getting back $259 million of economic impact in our local economy, regionally.” That’s one of the many reasons I, the federal government, the State of Michigan, local officials, chambers of commerce, labor unions, environmental groups, and many others came together in support of this project.  For our nation, this federal investment marks an important milestone. Palisades could be the first-ever recommissioning of a nuclear power plant – a key step in regaining American energy security and independence. The plant’s owner, Holtec International, is also planning to build two industry-first small modular reactor (SMR) units at the site which have the innovative potential to generate even more reliable carbon-free energy.  Leading up to the announcement, I’ve been advocating to position Southwest Michigan at the forefront of our nation’s lower-cost, safe, and reliable energy future. I’m proud to have led the bipartisan congressional letter for a safe and swift review of the loan application that was approved last week.  I’ve been highly engaged at the federal level on this critical issue by pressing the Biden Administration on restarting Palisades, supporting the power purchase agreement with Wolverine Power Cooperative, and visiting Holtec’s innovative manufacturing and research facility to see work being done for Palisades first-hand.   These steps are in addition to discussing how repowering the plant furthers my mission of making our area an even better place to live, work, and raise a family.

       " ' April 15th is one of the most loathsome days for Americans: Tax Day. Last Congress, the Democrat Majority and President Biden increased funding for the IRS by roughly $72 billion. This included funding to hire over 87,000 IRS agents with a focus on so-called rich Americans. However, when you look past the window dressing, it’s clear the IRS is still targeting middle-class Americans at an alarming pace.  As of last summer, 63% of new audits have targeted individuals making under $200,000, according to a recent report from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. This report also highlights that despite billions in funding, and a hiring goal of 3,700 to go after the so-called wealthy, the IRS has only hired a whopping 34 people during the first six months.  Already, the IRS hasn’t even been able to execute its top-line objectives, which is consistent with analysis from the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation showing that most of the tax revenue raised from these new agents would come from lower- and middle-income earners. This is why I voted to cut funding for the 87,000 IRS agents and claw back the ridiculously bloated IRS budget. You should be able to keep more of your hard-earned money, not send it to Washington so the IRS can then target you.   Remember, last year, the federal government collected $4.4 trillion in revenue. Washington doesn’t have a revenue problem; it has a spending problem. I do not want the Biden Administration’s IRS targeting middle-class families and small businesses across Van Buren and Berrien counties. I am committed to protecting Americans from governmental overreach and I will continue to battle bureaucrats in Washington over the proper size, role, and scope of the federal government.

       " ' Over the weekend, Iran launched a direct assault against Israel. I continue to stand with Israel, and completely condemn the actions of Iran.  Iran remains one of the most heavily sanctioned countries in the world. However, as recent as March 2024, the Biden Administration granted sanction waivers to Iran, potentially giving the regime access to billions of dollars. We cannot provide a financial lifeline to the Iranian regime as it continues to support terrorist organizations around the world and now directly attacks our allies.  My bill, the No U.S. Financing for Iran Act, was one of the first considered in the House to hold Iran accountable as well as limit the Iranian regime’s ability to finance terrorism. I am proud to say that H.R. 5921 passed the House with a bipartisan vote of 294-105.  The No U.S. Financing for Iran Act protects our national security interests in three main ways.  First, it prohibits Treasury from issuing licenses that allow U.S. financial institutions to enable trade with Iran.  Second, it further cuts off financing for Iran from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). While Iran is not currently seeking assistance from the Fund, it certainly could as an IMF member country. My bill makes clear that the United States, as the IMF’s largest shareholder, will oppose any such request. This prohibition would extend to the IMF Special Drawing Rights program, which Iran utilized in 2021 to access approximately $5 billion.  Lastly, it extends an existing prohibition against Export-Import Bank financing for Iran.  My bill is targeted. It tightens our grip on the Ayatollahs while permitting licenses to allow for humanitarian aid to continue flowing to the Iranian people.  When Americans deposit their earnings in a U.S. bank or entrust the government with their tax dollars, they do so assuming that the money will not be used in ways that undermine the security of our nation. These are commonsense but long overdue prohibitions to hold the Iranian regime accountable.

       " \"Eminent policymakers and scholars address today’s law and policy challenges By Cristian Rivera January 29, 2024 By 2050, Latinas are expected to make up 13% of the U.S. population, account for 11% of the labor force, and have a median age 11 years younger than their white counterparts. Yet Latinas comprise only\\xa02.5% of all U.S. lawyers,\\xa0account for less than 1% of all partners in law firms and have never served on the highest court in 44 states. To address this alarming gap in Latina representation and leadership in law and policy, the\\xa0UCLA Latino Policy and Politics Institute,\\xa0the\\xa0Latina Futures, 2050 Lab,\\xa0the\\xa0Latina Lawyers Bar Association,\\xa0and the\\xa0UCLA Chicanx Latinx Law Review\\xa0hosted the inaugural\\xa0Latina Futures: Transforming the Nation Through Law and Policy\\xa0symposium.\\xa0 The sold-out event, which took place Jan. 20 and 21 at UCLA’s Luskin Conference Center, brought together nearly 400 prominent Latina scholars, attorneys, politicians, policy leaders and students from across the country to explore today’s legal and advocacy challenges and opportunities through a Latina lens. “This weekend, we are replacing the status quo with forward-thinking, accurate, and necessary contributions from Latina leaders now and well into the future,” said\\xa0Sonja Diaz,\\xa0founding executive director of the Latino Policy and Politics Institute and co-founder of Latina Futures, 2050 Lab, in her opening remarks.\\xa0\\xa0 The event featured 11 panels and plenary sessions, two fireside chats, a keynote and networking opportunities that touched on a variety of topics, including affirmative action and reproductive justice, the intersectionality of Latina and LGBTQ+ identities, and avenues toward advancing legal and policy reforms that promote equality and inclusion. Participants shared personal and professional experiences that highlighted the need to increase the representation of Latina leaders in decision-making positions. Among the symposium’s 70 speakers was California Chief Justice Patricia Guerrero, the first Latina in this role, who spoke about her journey from the Imperial Valley and the challenges she overcame.\\xa0 In a fireside chat moderated by Margaret Salazar-Porzio, Mary Murguía, chief judge of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and her sister Janet Murguía, CEO and president of the civil rights and advocacy nonprofit UnidosUS, delved into their paths towards leadership and the hope they have for future leaders to unite Latino communities and the nation in an increasingly divided world. U.S. Rep. Nanette Barragán, a UCLA alumna from the class of 2000, California state Sen. María Elena Durazo, New Mexico state Sen. Antoinette Sedillo-Lopez, and Texas state Rep. Maria Luisa Flores shared their perspectives with Laura Gómez, a professor at UCLA School of Law, on the need for a Latina lens in policymaking across all levels of government. In addition, Vilma Martinez, U.S. ambassador to Argentina and former president and general counsel of MALDEF, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, challenged attendees to take ownership of the future and contribute to a more inclusive and equitable society.\\xa0 Reflecting on the\\xa050-year anniversary of\\xa0MALDEF, Martinez told the audience during the program that she felt an initial sense of disappointment because she thought the organization’s work would have been completed by this time. However, she continued, her feelings shifted with her recognition that our nation is built on grand aspirations and ideals — and achieving them is a long and continuous process. Professor\\xa0Veronica Terriquez,\\xa0director of\\xa0UCLA’s Chicano Studies Research Center\\xa0and co-founder of the Latina Futures, 2050 Lab – shared her vision for the future.\\xa0 “Together, we will tackle the most pressing social problems by taking an intersectional approach to our work.\\xa0 We must proceed in ways that are mindful of the diversity of our communities and inclusive of the voices of those often marginalized,” she said. “ We have the potential to inform social, political, and economic changes that benefit the majority of this nation.” Terriquez expressed her hope that the symposium would inspire participants to continue their advocacy and leadership. “I hope you feel energized from this weekend and will continue to fight for our communities,” she told the audience. “This is a long game, and it builds on the work that came before us.”\\xa0 Stay up-to-date on District 44's latest news, updates and more! \\nWashington D.C.

Rep. Nanette Diaz Barragán, who represents California’s 44th Congressional District, helped secure $850,000 for the nonprofit’s project. Congress members, during the 2024 fiscal year, were able to submit funding requests to the U.S. House of Representative’s Appropriations Committee for up to 15 community projects within their districts. “We’re looking forward to seeing how the money can make a difference to women and domestic violence survivors in the Long Beach area,” Barragán said in a Monday, April 22, interview. “Our focus was housing women, women empowerment and, of course, breaking the cycle — so this was an easy project to fund.” Barragán presented WomenShelter Long Beach and its various leaders with the $850,000 check during a Monday ceremony. WomenShelter Long Beach will use the funding to purchase and retrofit an existing house or apartment building, which will serve as a transitional housing facility for the nonprofit’s clients. The organization has provided crucial services for women and children since its establishment in 1977 — and offers a comprehensive suite of services for domestic violence survivors, including safe housing, emergency shelter, a 24-hour crisis hotline, counseling, legal advocacy and more. WomenShelter has yet to select a site for the new facility, according to Lisette Flores, the nonprofit’s board president. The location, when selected, won’t be shared publicly to protect future residents, Flores said in a Monday interview. “It could be in the flavor of a home, like what we have now,” Flores said, referencing WSLB’s existing emergency supportive housing shelter. “Or it could be like an apartment building where everyone has their own personal space.” Ideally, according to WomenShelter’s director of development, Nicholas Maddox, the new facility will have six to eight units — which could house multiple people, such a women and their children, to a single room. There isn’t a precise timeline for buying, retrofitting and opening the new facility, Flores said, though the goal is to have the project finished in the next six months to a year. Once open, clients will be able to live in the transitional housing facility for up to a year and the’ll also have access to case management, therapy and employment services. “I can personally say that the services and the work that our advocates do every single day makes a huge impact in everyone’s lives,” Jennifer Costa, WSLB’s director of outreach and education, said Monday. “Knowing that this continued support will be provided — it’s tremendous.” If you or someone you know is experiencing domestic violence, help is available 24/7 through the National Domestic Violence Hotline.

       " 'Washington, DC—April 23, 2024…Congressmen Steve Womack (R-AR-3) and Sanford D. Bishop, Jr. (D-GA-2) recently introduced H.Con.Res. 103, legislation that would authorize the use of the U.S. Capitol Rotunda for the lying in honor of Colonel Ralph Puckett, Jr., the last living Medal of Honor recipient for acts performed during the Korean War, and would honor those who served in the Armed Forces of the U.S. during the “Forgotten War” from 1950 to 1953. The Senate companion of this legislation—S.Con.Res. 33—was approved last week by both the Senate and the House of Representatives, allowing COL Puckett to officially lie in honor in the Capitol Rotunda on April 29, 2o24. Congressman Womack said, “Honoring Colonel Ralph Puckett, Jr., the last living Medal of Honor recipient from the Korean War, and his fellow Korean War veterans is the very least we can do to display our immense gratitude for his courageous service to our country. Allowing him to lie in honor in the Capitol Rotunda will pay tribute to his remarkable heroism and provide an opportunity for all Americans to express their appreciation and respect for his service. I’m proud to join my friend Congressman Bishop in this bipartisan effort to underscore our collective recognition of Colonel Puckett’s—and all Korean War veterans’—service and sacrifice.” Congressman Bishop said, “Colonel Ralph Puckett, Jr., was a cherished member of the Columbus community. Already a highly decorated officer whose sacrifices in the line of duty helped keep our country safe, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Honor by President Biden in 2021 for his heroism during the Korean War. He remained an integral part of the U.S. Army family, taking an active role in the life of Fort Moore and its soldiers. It is only befitting that Congress bestows this honor on Colonel Puckett. I want to thank U.S. House Speaker Johnson and Senate Majority Leader Schumer for their support as well as Congressman Steve Womack of Arkansas who joins me as the Republican co-lead of this bipartisan legislation.” As a 30-year veteran of the U.S. Army National Guard and the Chairman of the West Point Board of Visitors, Congressman Womack understands the importance of supporting our military and honoring those who answered the call to serve.',\n",
       " 'TAP Into logo JERSEY SHORE- In response to growing concerns from Belmar, NJ residents over Verizon\\'s plans to install twenty 30-foot 5G towers along the local boardwalk, Representative Chris Smith introduced a new piece of legislation aimed at giving local communities more say in such telecommunications projects.\\xa0The bill, HR 8082, seeks to overturn Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations\\xa0that currently streamline the approval process for 5G infrastructure, often sidelining local input. Introduced amid escalating legal disputes involving Verizon and Monmouth County, the legislation targets specific FCC rules established in 2018. These rules include \"shot clocks\" that limit the time town and county governments have to review and approve 5G projects, which Rep. Smith argues unfairly benefit the telecommunications industry at the expense of local governance. \"The heart of my legislation is to restore the critical voice of local residents in decisions that affect the health, safety, and aesthetics of their communities,\" Rep. Smith stated. He emphasized that the advancement of technology should not trample the concerns and values of local citizens. Last year, in a letter to Verizon, Rep. Smith urged the company to reconsider its installation plans and engage more transparently with the community. His legislative action reflects broader tensions between technological expansion and community rights, emphasizing a need for balance and respect for local jurisdictions. Rep. Smith\\'s proposal resonates with broader national concerns about the pace and nature of 5G rollout across the United States, highlighting a pivotal moment in the intersection of technology, regulation, and community rights.\\n Chris has three offices dedicated to constituent services.

       " 'Jersey Shore Online-MicroMedia Publications logo \\xa0 “The Township received a $6,000,000 Congressional District Spending Grant for the Completion of the Railroad Avenue Extension from Musket to South Street and From Lacey Road south to connect into Station Drive,” said Mayor Peggy Sue Juliano. “This includes the completion of the trail.” \\xa0 Money awarded for the special federal grant can only be used for the cited projects and cannot be redirected to anything else.\\n\\r\\n\\xa0 While expressing her gratitude to Congressman Chris Smith (R-4th) for securing funds, the mayor also highlighted the project’s special significance for Lacey. She credited her husband, the late Mayor Nick Juliano, Committeeman Mark Dykoff, and now Ocean County Commissioner Gary Quinn for initiating the discussions to free up traffic on Route 9. \\xa0 The project encompasses the construction of a new two-lane limited access road running parallel to Route 9, stretching from Lacey Road South to Station Drive and from Musket Drive North to South Street. Additionally, the extension will incorporate a multi-use path known as the Barnegat Branch Rail Trail, creating a vital link in the Ocean County Barnegat Bay Trail. \\xa0 Two phases of the Railroad Avenue extension were completed in 2017 at a cost of $3 million. Authorities could not move on to further completion because of a lack of money. The start of the project reportedly freed up traffic north of Lacey Road. Sunrise Beach residents also experienced an easier means of getting in and out of their development when the road was first extended. \\xa0 Nevertheless, the fact remains that congestion is a very real concern on Route 9. \\xa0 “During peak travel time, the Route 9 corridor in Lacey Township develops heavily, leaving no alternative paths to travel to other parts of the town or its neighboring communities,” said Rep. Smith, who is said to have to have personally secured the funds for the project as one of his congressional earmarks that were signed into law as part of a negotiated budget. \\xa0 “The extension of Railroad Avenue will not only ease the flow of traffic within Lacey Township but will also improve safety conditions for drivers, passengers, and pedestrians alike,” Smith said. \\xa0 Drainage issues in the area will also be addressed as part of the overall project estimated at $6,119,345. New construction plans include drainage swales, stormwater piping, and an infiltration basin. These improvements aim to alleviate flooding during storms and enhance overall safety and efficiency for travel on Route 9 during inclement weather. \\xa0 Township Administrator Veronica Laureigh said that she spoke with Chris Smith’s office about the fact that no one was addressing the traffic on Route 9 and learned of the opportunity for congressional spending and its projected use. She encouraged members of the governing body to apply for funding. \\xa0 The end result should be completion of a road similar to McKinley Boulevard in Manahawkin that runs parallel to Route 72. The speed limit on Railroad Avenue will remain at 30 mph as required by the initial permit approving the project. \\xa0 Unlike other municipalities along the Barnegat Branch Rail Trail, Lacey owns the railroad right-of-way. The township acquired rights to the property by way of a tax foreclosure sale in 1994. Ocean County owns the land in other local towns and has used it to develop the Barnegat Rail Trail. Lacey has not turned over its portion to the County but has made an agreement as far as an access easement. \\xa0 Authorities are waiting for further information concerning when the funds will be made available and will then establish a timeline for the work.\\xa0 Chris has three offices dedicated to constituent services.

       " 'WASHINGTON – U.S. Representatives Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and Scott Peters (D-Calif.) and U.S. Senators Chris Murphy (D-Conn.)\\xa0and\\xa0Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)\\xa0on Tuesday led 14\\xa0of their Senate and House colleagues in sending a letter to Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chair Lina Khan urging the FTC to finalize a proposed rule to ban non-compete agreements as soon as possible. In their letter, the members illustrated the myriad harmful effects of non-compete agreements on both workers and the economy and highlighted the anticipated benefits of the FTC’s rule. U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and U.S. Representatives Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), Dwight Evans (D-Pa.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), Greg Casar (D-Texas),\\xa0Lizzie Fletcher (D-Texas), Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.), Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) and Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.)\\xa0also signed the letter. “The negative effects of non-compete agreements are widespread and pervasive across all sectors of the economy,”\\xa0the members wrote.\\xa0“While some special interests would have one believe non-compete agreements are essential tools for protecting sensitive business information and only affect a small handful of well-placed boardroom executives, the evidence paints a different picture. A staggering 30 million workers in the United States are bound by non-competes – a figure that represents roughly 20 percent of the American workforce. In many instances, non-competes are applied to low-wage workers even though, according to a GAO report, businesses admit these workers do not have access to confidential business information. Studies have shown that among workplaces that pay their employees an average of $13, nearly 30% of them apply non-compete agreements to their workers. For employers who are worried about their sensitive business information, other options exist. Non-disclosure agreements, for example, could be used to prevent employees from disclosing business information to their new employer.” The members continued:\\xa0“To make matters worse, workers from historically marginalized communities are often the most impacted by non-compete agreements. Research suggests that non-compete clauses lower earnings for female and nonwhite workers and that workers with less education experience greater wage loss from non-competes. Non-compete agreements have also been shown to slow innovation and hamper economic dynamism. In the last 40 years, startup growth in the United States has slowed. Research has shown that non-compete agreements reduce firm entry and spinout rates, and that firms founded in states where these agreements are in effect, are more likely to fail than those in states where non-competes are banned.” The members concluded, voicing their support for the FTC’s rule and calling for its swift finalization:\\xa0“We are pleased that the FTC is taking this much-needed step to protect workers across the country. The proposed Non-competes Clause Rule will help ensure American workers enjoy the freedom to change jobs when they want and remain free from the interference and intimidation that often comes with a non-compete agreement. In addition, the proposed rule would give employers the freedom to compete for talent, which is an essential component of a vibrant and robust job marketplace. Our economy and our country do best when wages increase, and workers can compete for better jobs and better wages. The FTC’s rule on non-compete agreements will bring a welcome change for workers across the country, and we encourage you to finalize it as soon as possible.” Read the full letter\\xa0HERE. \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIssues: Jobs, Labor, & the Economy  \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWashington, DC Office\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t2346 Rayburn House Office Building\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWashington.

       " 'FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE |\\xa0Contact: Olivia Porcaro 202-225-6165 On April 10th, I was ratified by the House Republican Conference as the new Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee - but not only did I just become the new Chairman, I also became the first Native American to ever Chair this Committee.  As an enrolled member of the Chickasaw Nation of Oklahoma, my tribal heritage is something I am very proud of, and I was very fortunate to witness this culture firsthand while growing up. My great, great grandfather served as the clerk for the Chickasaw Nation Supreme Court, my great grandfather was the Treasurer of Chickasaw Nation, my great aunt, Te Ata Fisher, was a famous actress and storyteller who performed Native American stories all over the world, and my late mother and inspiration, Helen Cole, was the first Native American woman elected to the Oklahoma State Senate.  My family members truly made it a priority of theirs to preserve tribal culture, and, as one of only five Native Americans and Alaska Natives in Congress and the first Native American House Appropriations Committee Chair, it is a top priority of mine to protect our tribes as well.   It is important to remember that Native Americans are the First Americans. They are sovereign nations who governed themselves long before settlers arrived, and they continue to do so today. Through legally binding agreements, such as the federal trust responsibility, the United States is obligated to provide services and federal resources to tribes — a responsibility I have been and will continue to work to ensure is met.   It is critical tribes and the federal government have mutual respect. States and the federal government must work with Native Americans to maintain the integrity of their heritage, culture, and rights. At the same time, the federal government must uphold its constitutional oath to tribes to provide basic resources such as healthcare, education, infrastructure, and law enforcement, among many others, in Indian Country. Tribes do not receive state assistance and cannot tax their own citizens, which is why expanding and promoting economic development within tribal communities and committing these federal resources is so important.   This is why, during my tenure as Chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development, I fought to secure historic gains for traditionally underfunded Native American housing and transportation programs. Specifically, I was able to obtain $1.34 billion for Native American housing programs and $150 million in discretionary appropriations for Tribal Transportation programs in the Fiscal Year 2024 appropriations package. Over the years, I have also fought to secure advanced appropriations funding for the Indian Health Service, ensuring that tribal communities are never at risk of losing healthcare access in the case of a government shutdown.   I have long been, and always will be, an advocate for expanding self-governance wherever possible and ensuring tribes receive the resources they need to take care of their communities because, at the end of the day, tribes are the best at taking care of their people. As Chairman of the full House Appropriations Committee, I will continue to work to set these increases as the standard for this necessary funding in the future.   Lastly, it is important that my fellow members of Congress are informed about the very unique issues concerning Native Americans, the sovereign rights of tribes, and their relationship with the federal government. As the Republican Co-Chair of the bipartisan Congressional Native American Caucus, this is exactly what I strive to do. Tribal issues span to every single House Committee, so it is important to keep Native American issues top of mind as members take up legislation.   In conclusion, tribes have played a very important role in American history. They have greatly influenced this nation and the land on which we live, even before the United States truly came to be. As the longest serving Native American in the House of Representatives, I know that it is an honor and a privilege to be a voice for tribes in Congress, and will continue to ensure that we, as a body, are protecting their autonomy and culture.

       " 'April 19, 2024 For Immediate Release Contact: Taylor Haulsee \\xa0 \\xa0 Speaker Johnson joined the Ben Shapiro Show to discuss the national security supplemental \\xa0 WASHINGTON\\xa0—\\xa0Today, Speaker Johnson joined the Ben Shapiro Show to discuss President Biden’s failed foreign policy, the House national security supplemental legislation, and the importance of America projecting strength on the world stage. \\xa0 Click here to listen to the full interview \\xa0 On American strength:  \\xa0 I believe in peace through strength. I believe in what Ronald Reagan said, it does not mean that we’re the world’s policemen. It does not mean that American troops should have boots on the ground everywhere. That’s not what we’re for. But to your point, Ben, and you’ve said it well; a strong America is good for stability around the globe. What does that mean? It means the perception of a strong America we’re the last great superpower. We, you know, we’re the greatest nation in the history of the world. It’s not even close. We’re the most free, most benevolent the strongest, the most powerful. And if we don’t act like it, then terrorists and tyrants take over. \\xa0 The reason that Iran and China and North Korea and Russia right now are acting so provocatively is because we’re projecting weakness on the world stage. Joe Biden’s foreign policy has been an absolute disaster. And that’s what’s got us in this situation. And if we do this little bit of investment here, we can stem the tide, hold them off, hopefully until we get a new president. And that day cannot happen soon enough. \\xa0 On the House’s leverage with the national security supplemental legislation: \\xa0 The House is fixing the Senate supplemental bill, the foreign aid bill that was sent to us a few months ago with better policy and better process. And so what we’ve done is we’ve taken, for example, the Ukraine funding elements that are, that are controversial, of course, on our side, we’ve added a loan instrument. We have added the, the REPO Act, which is the use of corrupt Russian oligarchs’ seized assets to support the effort there. We’ve added oversight, accountability, and a strategy shift to force the White House to give us the information and the end game and all the rest. We have an amendment process, so we can address each of these measures on their own merit in four separate bills instead of having them sandwiched together. And everybody can vote their own will and their own conscience and their own constituents. That’s the way this place is supposed to work. And we included tough measures on Russia, China, and Iran, including sanctions and some other innovation. So a very important change in both the process and the policy, and if we had not done this Ben, and this is very important, we would have had to eat the Senate supplemental if, if we had not taken this step, there would’ve been a discharge petition. And that means that a handful of Republicans would’ve crossed over and gotten on board with the Democrats to force it out of my hands and make us take the Senate supplemental as is. That was not an acceptable outcome, and this is the best possible outcome that we can achieve. \\xa0 On the vital importance of deterring Vladimir Putin: \\xa0 Look on the Ukraine piece, this is really important to point out. You know, there’s a lot of angst about, you know, quote unquote sending more money to Ukraine, but 80% of the funds that are in this package for Ukraine are literally to replenish American weapons and stocks and facilities. This is America’s defense and industrial base. This is building weapons here at home and refilling our stockpiles really, really important thing for us to do. Ukraine is in a position where they very likely would, would fall. And so this is going to allow them to, to at least hold the line. And I believe then that President Donald Trump is gonna have another term and in, in early next year if this is continuing to that point, I think he’s the one that has the strength to go in and negotiate a peace in this. But not if Russia rolls through the country, I mean, this is really important. As I said in a, in a press gaggle here the other day, to be blunt, I would rather send bullets to Ukraine than boys. You know American soldiers, we don’t want boots on the ground. We’re not the world’s policemen. If we can invest this small amount right now and achieve the desired outcome that is better for us in the long run, and it saves us a lot of money and of course, blood and toil. \\xa0 \\xa0 ### \\n\\nTags: \\n Tweet\\n Share\\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tH-232, The Capitol\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWashington, D.C. 20515\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t202-225-4000\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t ©2024 U.S. House of Representatives.

This legislation is comprised of four separate bills and provides resources to Israel, Ukraine, and the Indo-Pacific, as well as measures to counter adversaries in each region. \\xa0 “This legislation also includes enhanced oversight and accountability of U.S. taxpayer resources and includes upgrades to the Senate bill like the REPO Act and transferring portions of Ukraine aid into a loan. What we’ve done is taken the Senate supplemental bill, and we’ve improved the process and the policy, and that’s a really important thing,” Speaker Johnson said. \\xa0 Conservatives, faith leaders, advocacy organizations strongly support the legislation: \\xa0 “AIPAC strongly supports Speaker Johnson’s work to bring important national security bills to the floor, and we urge every House member to vote for crucial security aid to our ally Israel,” — \\xa0AIPAC. \\xa0 “The Israel Supplemental Appropriations Act provides critical support to a key ally facing our common enemy, Iran. This is especially true now that Iran has attacked Israel directly, not just through proxies. We call upon all Members of Congress to support the rule & the bill,” — Coalition for Jewish Values. \\xa0 “We urge all members to support the rule allowing the foreign aid bill to come to the floor so we can deliver critical emergency military assistance to Israel. Don’t tell us you stand with Israel, show us,” — Christians United for Israel. \\xa0 “In the aftermath of the October 7th Hamas massacre and Iran’s direct attack against Israel’s homeland, these votes are an especially critical test of support for the US-Israel alliance. The time to act is now,” — Republican Jewish Coalition. \\xa0 “We welcome the release of the House of Representatives’ security supplemental package, which includes a number of vital measures that AJC has long advocated for, such as security assistance to our allies Israel and Ukraine, and funding for the Nonprofit Security Grant Program to keep Jewish communities in the U.S. safe. We urge its swift passage,” — American Jewish Committee. \\xa0 “It is absolutely critical that Christians in America and around the world stand with Israel, protect Israel’s right to defend itself, and work to contain this conflict so that it doesn’t threaten global peace. We stand with Israel,” — Family Research Council. \\xa0 “The leadership of Speaker Mike Johnson has been crucial in defending life, religious freedom, fiscal responsibility, and important allies like Israel. He always stands strong and we’re proud to stand with him,” — Center for Urban Renewal. \\xa0 “As former Secretary of State and former Vice Chief of Staff of the Army we write at a pivotal moment in our nation’s history to applaud your efforts to secure vital support to America’s allies and to strengthen America’s defenses,” — Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo & Vice Chief of Staff to the Army Jack Keane. \\xa0 “Speaker Mike Johnson is a man of incredible character, who has unequivocally shown his support of protecting the unborn, the family, and standing strong with one of our greatest allies, Israel. In light of Iran’s unprecedented attack against Israel last week, we must ensure that every Republican is supportive of the Speaker’s efforts to bring Israel funding to the finish line as quickly as possible. CWALAC supports Speaker Johnson and his efforts to support Israel,” — Concerned Women for America LAC. \\xa0 “Last week, the ERLC sent a letter to Speaker Johnson & all members of Congress urging them to pass critical support for Ukraine. While there are some political headwinds, I’m grateful Mike Johnson is moving forward to help Ukraine defend itself against Putin’s illegal invasion,” — Brent Leatherwood, Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission President.  \\xa0 “This supplemental package includes bills that the CCP, Russia, and the Islamic Republic of Iran all vehemently oppose, it will be devastating to our enemies if this passes,” — POLARIS. \\xa0 “A resilient U.S. DIB and a strong network of U.S. allies and partners form the foundation of U.S. national deterrence in a rapidly evolving strategic environment. On behalf of NDIA’s members, I commend the House leadership for supporting these necessary investments and urge swift passage,” — David Norquist, National Defense Industry Association President. \\xa0 “The bill to force China to divest from TikTok may soon be on the President’s desk. Thank you Speaker Johnson for your leadership,” — Foundation for American Innovation. \\xa0 “FDD Action endorses the supplemental funding package put forward today by Speaker Mike Johnson. We urge members of Congress on both sides of the aisle to support it along with the underlying rule. America’s adversaries are watching. The authoritarian axis of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Russia, and the Chinese Communist Party are challenging U.S. interests like never before. It is imperative that both chambers of the Congress act with urgency to provide critical support to Israel, Taiwan, and Ukraine. These nations are on the front lines of a generation-defining fight for freedom and prosperity, and their success is inextricably linked to our own national security. This legislation paves the way for targeted investments with strong oversight in our allies and partners that will enhance their military capabilities, deter America’s adversaries, and contain the spread of even costlier conflicts,” — Foundation for Defense of Democracies Action. \\xa0 “In supporting U.S. assistance to Ukraine, Israel, and allies in the Indo-Pacific, Speaker Johnson channels President Ronald Reagan. Speaking to Congress in 1985, President Reagan declared, ‘We must stand by all our democratic allies. And we must not break faith with those who are risking their lives,’” — Ronald Reagan Institute. \\xa0 “We should all call our congressmen and urge them to pass aid to stop Putin, to help Israel, to strengthen Taiwan and to close the border. I am especially glad that the REPO act has been included to use Russian money to pay for defeating Putin,” — Former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich. \\xa0 “America is the leader of the free world and I would call on all my old friends in the Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, to rally around Speaker Johnson as he brings legislation to the floor to do America’s part to renew our support for Ukraine, for Israel, for Taiwan, and for freedom in the world,” — Former Vice President Mike Pence. \\xa0 ### \\n\\nTags: \\n Tweet\\n Share\\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tH-232, The Capitol\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWashington, D.C. 20515\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t202-225-4000\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t ©2024 U.S. House of Representatives.

       " 'April 19, 2024 For Immediate Release Contact: Taylor Haulsee \\xa0 Speaker delivers remarks following House vote on rule \\xa0 WASHINGTON\\xa0—\\xa0Following a 316-94 vote on the procedural rule to allow amendments and debate on the House national security supplemental, Speaker Johnson delivered brief remarks to press off the House floor: \\xa0 “The Senate sent us effectively a blank check for foreign aid, and that was not going to work for the policy or the process in the House. It is a better process to break the bills up into four separate measures for consideration and that is what we will have tomorrow. Everyone can vote their will and their constituents desires on Israel aid, the Ukrainian aid, the Indo-Pacific, and our fourth national security package that has all of the innovations in it. \\xa0 “Because we did this process, we got a better outcome. There are a lot of innovations that the Senate didn’t consider. We include the REPO Act, which as you know is the use of corrupt Russian oligarchs’ assets to help fund the resistance in Ukraine. We introduced the loan concept for the governmental assistance part to be provided a loan, instead of a gift. We also included some really important sanctions on Russia and China and Iran, which I believe is the new axis of evil, and many of us do. They are the ones who are the aggressors in this situation. \\xa0 “The reality here is that if the House did not do this better policy and process, allowing for amendments on the floor in the process tomorrow, we would have had to eat the Senate supplemental bill. And that is because we were very close, given the timeline of both Israel and Ukraine, to a discharge petition being brought. And a discharge petition, in layman’s terms, is when a number of members or a majority of members get together, they can override the Speaker and bring something straight to the floor. That would have happened imminently on the Senate supplemental. \\xa0 “So, by doing this, even though it’s not the perfect legislation, it’s not the legislation that we would write if Republicans were in charge of both the House, the Senate, and the White House, this is the best possible product that we can get under these circumstances to take care of these really important obligations. And so, we look forward to the vote tomorrow. We look forward to every member voting their conscience and their desire. And that is exactly how this process is supposed to work and how the House is supposed to operate. We’re happy to provide that and we’ll give you more comment tomorrow.” \\xa0 ### \\n\\nTags: \\n Tweet\\n Share\\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tH-232, The Capitol\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWashington, D.C. 20515\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t202-225-4000\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t ©2024 U.S. House of Representatives.

       " 'April 20, 2024 For Immediate Release Contact: Taylor Haulsee \\xa0 “We gave our members a voice. We gave them a better process and ultimately a much better policy.” \\xa0 WASHINGTON\\xa0—\\xa0Today, following House passage of the national security supplemental, Speaker Johnson delivered remarks to press off the House floor. \\xa0 Watch Speaker Johnson’s full remarks here \\xa0 Read below for the full transcript of Speaker Johnson’s remarks: \\xa0 The House has worked its will. These are not normal times here in the House or around the world as we all know, and we saw the disturbance here on the House floor just a bit ago. I just want to say simply what I think most people around the country understand and agree, we should only wave one flag on the House floor. And I think we know which flag that is. \\xa0 I said these are not normal times, they’re not, the world is destabilized and it’s a tinderbox. It’s a dangerous time. Three of our primary adversaries, Russia, Iran, and China are working together, and they’re being aggressors around the globe. And they’re a global threat to our prosperity and our security. Their advance threatens the free world, and it demands American leadership. If we turn our backs right now the consequences could be devastating. \\xa0 So, this afternoon, the House acted and we sent over to the Senate – it will be transmitted shortly – our supplemental national security legislation and make no mistake, this is not a blank check like the Senate supplemental bill was. This is very different. Instead of taking the path of least resistance and bringing up the Senate supplemental on the House floor, or just allowing a discharge petition to come forward – which would have had the same outcome – we gave our members a voice. We gave them a chance. We gave them a better process, and ultimately a much better policy. \\xa0 Unlike the Senate’s blank check, the House legislation has a number of very important features. It provides for greater accountability over Ukraine aid.\\xa0 It forces an end-game strategy for the Ukraine war. It includes a loan instrument of this foreign aid to Ukraine and the REPO act to ensure that Russian assets pay for part of the bill. And unlike the Senate’s bill, the loan system itself is a House innovation, and allows for much needed insight. And remember that 80% of the Ukraine funding will go to the replenishment of American weapons and stocks and our facilities and our operations. \\xa0 It also includes tough measures and sanctions on Iran and Russia and China, which most of the American people understand is a necessity and a very important thing. Our process in the end ensured that each member was able to consider the individual supplemental elements on their own merits, which is exactly how the House is supposed to work. \\xa0 I know there are critics of the legislation, I understand that it is not a perfect piece of legislation. We’re not insured that in a time of divided government and at a time where there are lots of different opinions, but there is no question whatsoever that the House has made many strong improvements to the Senate bill. And the product that we’ve sent over there is much better. This package, I will note because it’s very important, also includes national security priorities and many of them, but it is the only way that we could have gotten Democrats to support aid to Israel. And that’s a fact. \\xa0 There is a lot of misinformation out there about the bill. And I just want to make one point about one issue that has drawn a lot of attention and that is could any of this funding go to Hamas or to terrorist organizations or what have you. And we put safeguards in the legislation to ensure that UNRWA is not funded, the UN agency that included terrorists who participated in the October 7th attack on Israel. We’ve also had language that prevents it from going in either funding going to Hamas, or any other bad actors. That’s a very important element of oversight. Congress takes the oversight very seriously. And we will continue to keep an eye on every dollar that we’re using and investing at this time. \\xa0 I’ve said it very simply. I’ll say it once again. It’s an old military adage, but we would rather send bullets to the conflict overseas than our own boys, our troops. And I think this is an important moment and important opportunity to make that decision. We allowed the House to do that. And I expect the Senate will make the same decision. \\xa0 Background: \\xa0 ### \\n\\nTags: \\n Tweet\\n Share\\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tH-232, The Capitol\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWashington, D.C. 20515\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t202-225-4000\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t ©2024 U.S. House of Representatives.

       " 'April 20, 2024 For Immediate Release Contact: Taylor Haulsee \\xa0 WASHINGTON\\xa0—\\xa0Read the RealClearPolitics profile of Speaker Mike Johnson, “A Beleaguered Gentleman: Speaker Mike Johnson,” out today at RealClearPolitics.com. \\xa0 “You assume risk when you take this job. We don’t back away from risk. I’m going to do the right thing,” Johnson says as storm clouds – literal ones, not just the political variety – roll in… After all, the speaker continues, “what is popular isn’t always right; what’s right isn’t always popular.” \\xa0 A Beleaguered Gentleman: Speaker Mike Johnson RealClearPolitics Philip Wegmann April 20, 2024 \\xa0 The sky is cloudless and blue on a warm April afternoon as a cheerful Mike Johnson, seated on a beige couch next to an unlit fireplace in an office still new to him, contemplates his demise, taking solace in Providence and repeating the words of John Quincy Adams – an illustration of his circumstances almost as much as a reluctant acceptance of fate: \\xa0 “Duty is ours. Results are God’s.” \\xa0 The future of the 56th speaker of the House of Representatives also belongs to the Almighty, if not a small cadre of his fellow Republicans. Johnson admits as much in an interview with RealClearPolitics on Monday when asked if he’s prepared to risk his speakership over sending war aid to Ukraine. \\xa0 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has warned that his country will lose to Russia unless the United States approves more military aid. Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, meanwhile, has promised the speaker that he will lose his job if Congress does exactly that. \\xa0 “You assume risk when you take this job. We don’t back away from risk. I’m going to do the right thing,” Johnson says as storm clouds – literal ones, not just the political variety – roll in. Financing a land war wasn’t “some minor measure on tax policy,” he adds. It instead has “implications for the entire world.” Afterall, the speaker continues, “what is popular isn’t always right; what’s right isn’t always popular.” \\xa0 Johnson pauses at that, smiling sheepishly at the “bumper sticker slogan” he’s uttered. Thunder and rain follow the interview, and the storm now follows the speaker as he struggles to survive. He has a possible coup on his hands, and the party leader whom barely anyone really knows could soon be toppled. \\xa0 The Louisiana Republican’s path to the speakership was the product of chaos after Kevin McCarthy was ousted last October through a motion to vacate, a parliamentary rule that allows a single member to force a vote to remove the speaker. After a unanimous Democratic Party House conference joined forces with eight conservative GOP renegades, McCarthy was out and the ad hoc effort to find his replacement began. More seasoned Republicans volunteered for the job. Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana. Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan of Ohio. Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota. All fell short, one by one. \\xa0 The fourth nominee was different. “We were finally just so sick of it,” recalls Texas Rep. Michael McCaul, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, “that we all threw our hands up, and said we don’t have anything against this guy. Let’s just go with him.” Three weeks of infighting ended when the conservative and centrist wings of the GOP made peace. Congress elected Johnson, the vice chair of the GOP caucus, the lowest man on the leadership totem pole, by a party-line vote of\\xa0 220-209. “I never aspired to it,” he says of the position. His family hadn’t planned on it either. Johnson’s wife, Kelly, couldn’t catch a flight to D.C. in time to see her husband sworn in. \\xa0 The New York Times described him as “conservative hard-liner beloved by the far right” who was little-known other than his record as a lawyer and legislator, punctuated by gently articulated opposition to abortion, homosexuality, and gay marriage. His election, the paper reported in a breaking news bulletin, “further cemented the Republican Party’s lurch to the right.” \\xa0 Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters he had never met Johnson. White House aides scrambled to Google the man just elected second-in-line to the presidency. The conservatives who knew of him were ecstatic. \\xa0 Johnson introduced himself by telling Congress that they had cast the votes, but the decision had come from above. Leaning on Scripture, the new speaker said in his acceptance speech “that God has ordained and allowed each one of us to be brought here for this specific moment in time.” The House assented with polite, if not occasionally bemused, applause. “It’s not like his value set is hidden,” says Tony Perkins, the president of the conservative Family Research Council, who hired Johnson out of law school as an aide in the Louisiana\\xa0 legislature. “You don’t need a decoder ring. Want to know his positions? Read the Bible.” \\xa0 And Johnson does look, and he often sounds, like a Sunday school teacher. In dozens of interviews with colleagues, friends, and contemporaries, none could recall the bookish lawyer ever raising his voice in anger. “He has the decorum of a Southern gentleman in the DNA,” insists Rep. Clay Higgins, a Louisiana Republican and Freedom Caucus member who calls the speaker “my brother.” He is also a creature of the right, best known before politics as a litigator who filed an amicus brief to the Supreme Court in defense of “traditional marriage” on behalf of the conservative analogue of the ACLU, a group called Alliance Defending Freedom. \\xa0 “I don’t know how Rayburn felt about IVF,” jokes South Dakota Rep. Dusty Johnson, who chairs the Main Street Caucus, a group of more moderate Republicans in Congress, “but I think it’s safe to say that Mike Johnson is the most conservative speaker in modern political history.” \\xa0 A Leadership Newcomer \\xa0 He can offer more than devotions and hallway homilies, however. A constitutional law attorney, Johnson ingrained himself in the Republican Study Committee when he came to Congress in 2017 and was later elected chairman of the group that churns out white papers as the GOP’s in-house conservative think tank. “He possesses tremendous intellectual firepower,” says Alabama Rep. Gary Palmer, the fifth ranking Republican in the House. Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana describes Johnson in a way the speaker himself never would: “He pisses excellence.” \\xa0 But an impressive resume is no guarantee of success. Johnson had little leadership experience, other than scheduling the one-minute floor speeches members make in the morning to an empty House chamber. He certainly hadn’t negotiated anything of consequence. On his first full day in the job, the rookie speaker sat across the table in the White House Situation Room with President Biden, a man who first ran for the U.S. Senate the year Johnson was born. They’d never previously met. \\xa0 “That’s a pretty tall order, especially when you’re brand new as a speaker,” recalls McCaul, who accompanied Johnson to negotiations at the White House three months later. The speaker, still green but growing, held forth to demand Biden defend not just Ukrainian territory but America’s own border. “It was almost like the newly elected junior speaker was growing into the position by educating the president,” McCaul says of Johnson’s lecture to Biden about executive actions that could be taken, sans Congress, to slow the surge of illegal crossings. \\xa0 “We understand that there’s concern about the safety, security and sovereignty of Ukraine,” Johnson told reporters after the meeting wrapped, “but the American people have those same concerns about our own domestic sovereignty and our safety and our security.” \\xa0 The lesson did not stick. Biden has not taken executive action on the border. Congress has not approved more aid Ukraine either. Conservative hopes of forcing Democrats to swallow beefed up border security in exchange for more war funding dimmed and now seem out of reach. \\xa0 “Mike Johnson has constantly been calling me ‘a friend,’” Greene complains. “I don’t even know Mike Johnson!” She has haunted the speaker for months, promising to topple him with the same motion to vacate that ended McCarthy’s tenure if Johnson moves more Ukraine aid. “He’s not a friend of mine.” MTG, as Greene is often referred to, details during an interview with RealClearPolitics the alleged sins of the speaker against MAGA. They are many. \\xa0 MTG isn’t just angry about efforts to underwrite the land war in Europe. She is furious about the spending bills that Johnson helped muscle through with Democratic support to avoid a government shutdown, legislative behemoths that ballooned the deficit, and worst of all in her mind, funded the Department of Justice that’s bringing charges against the former president. \\xa0 “Johnson funded that,” she fumes. “They want to kill Trump,” she said of the myriad of indictments brought by the DOJ. “They want him to die in jail!” \\xa0 “MAGA, Christian, conservative,” Greene continues, rattling off the resume Johnson presented to the conference. “He has completely betrayed all three of those identities.” \\xa0 Johnson is barely six months into the job. His colleagues report that the Southern Baptist doesn’t drink, smoke, or cuss. But hardliners like Greene complain that he doesn’t fight either. \\xa0 “Well,” Johnson replies, back in his office, “that’s just not accurate.” With Trump’s blessing, he helped smother a bipartisan border deal deemed insufficiently conservative. The House also impeached Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas over his handling of the border. But on spending, the past isn’t dead, he says in so many words. It isn’t even past, as Faulkner might add. Instead, Johnson says he was bequeathed a cursed dowry from McCarthy. \\xa0 “I inherited a budget deal made by my predecessor that was unchangeable,” he explains. With one half of one third of government barely under his control, the speaker reports running into a brick wall while negotiating with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jefferies and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Republican minority leader, wasn’t any help either. \\xa0 “I was reminded very quickly by the other three of the four corners that ‘No, the deal was made,’” Johnson says in recapping weeks of negotiations. \\xa0 “It doesn’t apply to me,” he shot back. \\xa0 “‘Oh, yes, it does. It’s the House’s deal,’” they replied. “So, we did the best we could within that to fight for our policy priorities,” Johnson sighs, “and we got many of them.” But his right flank isn’t satisfied by wins on the margin, despite one of the slimmest majority margins in U.S history. \\xa0 Walking a Narrow Path \\xa0 Enter coalition government, where the byword is compromise, a liability for Johnson when conservatives consider bipartisanship a bitter poison. \\xa0 The speaker holds the majority, yes, but only by a margin of 218 to 213. More than a quarter of his caucus, 55 Republicans, a recent Wall Street Journal analysis found, consistently vote against major government spending bills. To get around his right flank’s objections, and to keep the government from shutting down, Johnson has resorted to a maneuver called suspension of the rules, which requires a two-thirds supermajority of votes. A majority of Democrats, not Republicans, have supplied needed votes. Of course, Johnson could have thrown a Hail Mary. He could have threatened a shutdown to try and force the White House and Senate to his will. \\xa0 “The people who are the most frustrated about the spending process wanted us to shut the government down,” Johnson explains. “They fail to acknowledge the reality that a government shutdown would not behoove the country or our chances to prevail in November.” If he had cast his lot with the hardliners and the government went dark, Johnson insists, it would have “backfired” and given “the White House all the cards.” \\xa0 This pains the speaker. He sees himself as a conservative, and not so long ago he regularly broke bread with the Freedom Caucus. “They are some of my best friends,” he said years ago when running for RSC chairman, describing “the tremendous amount of respect” he had for how those hardliners thwarted then-Speaker Paul Ryan’s plans to pass a watered-down version of Obamacare repeal. He was right there with them trying to jam the speaker. He hated the parliamentary tricks leadership played, especially the thousand-page bills dropped overnight on the rank-and-file. “I didn’t sign up to do legislation that way,” Johnson complained. He was an insurgent – though a polite one. \\xa0 Barely finished with his freshman year, Johnson was accustomed to “the arm-wrestling routine.” In the newsroom of the conservative Washington Examiner, the lawmaker nobody knew praised a robust back-and-forth. “We never compromise our core principles,” he said then of how conservatives ought to legislate, “but you have to compromise your preferences sometimes.” Almost as an afterthought, he added, “otherwise, the system breaks down.” \\xa0 It was the summer of 2018. With unified government, Republicans could afford to squabble a bit,\\xa0 up until the point they lost the House and then the White House and Senate. One thing Johnson vowed never to change: a promise to his family. “When I go home,” he explained, “I want to look my kids in the eye and tell them that daddy acted like a gentleman.” \\xa0 This past March, Johnson felt he owed Biden an apology. Seated just over the president’s shoulder during the State of the Union address, the speaker couldn’t mask his expressions of exhaustion and exasperation as Biden laid into Republicans. The two next met on Capitol Hill for the Friends of Ireland luncheon where Johnson toasted Biden as “America’s most famous Irishman.” On loan from the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, his pint glass was the same one Reagan used during a 1984 visit to Ireland. The Guinness the Southern Baptist speaker drank was non-alcoholic. \\xa0 Johnson pulled Biden aside to “apologize for the eye-roll memes that went around the world.” The president laughed, then told the speaker he was glad Johnson was better behaved than Nancy Pelosi had been during the speeches of his predecessor: “I’m just grateful you didn’t rip my speech up.” The speaker replied, “Well, Mr. President, don’t think my friends back home didn’t want me to light it on fire.” \\xa0 It may have been a missed opportunity. A little arson might have endeared him to the bomb throwers in his caucus. Former Speaker Newt Gingrich recently commiserated that the current speaker was leading “the most complicated House since the Civil War,” a sentiment Johnson doesn’t dispute. “It is an extraordinary time of challenge,” he says as members of his own party plot against him. \\xa0 “We’re going through a valley right now,” Johnson insists, “but I’m very bullish on the November election cycle, and I believe we’re going to be in a much better place on the other side of this.” He himself may not make it. The life spans of Republican speakers are shrinking. Predecessors John Boehner, Ryan, and McCarthy were run out of town due to rebellions, exhaustion, or a mix of both. \\xa0 Democrats don’t seem to have the same problem, a fact not lost on Johnson. On the other side of the aisle, he sees a party that “thinks like a union, they really do. They think as collectivists, as a body, and it’s easier to move them as social animals.” The Party of Lincoln, on the other hand, is made up of “rugged individualists by nature. We are deeply principled, and we just don’t yield as easily.” This is “a great blessing” Johnson says, “but it’s also a great challenge when you have a single-vote margin in a legislative body where you need everybody to work and move in the same direction.” When combined with a 24-hour news cycle and compounded by social media, he continues, “there are challenges right now that no previous speaker has had to contend with.” \\xa0 Greene filed her motion to vacate with the House clerk right before Congress left for Easter recess. She chose not to privilege the resolution, which would have triggered an immediate floor vote, referring to the motion instead as “more of a warning than a pink slip.” What has followed, according to one senior GOP aide, is an exercise in “Nixon-era Mad Men theory.” The question is not if, but when, a challenge will come. \\xa0 “If we vacate the chair a second time, there is no one who could successfully lead this conference. No one. That person does not exist, not only in the House. They don’t exist in this country,” Dusty Johnson, the moderate Republican, groaned. He added, “If we are so broken that we are going to perform this Greek tragedy a second time, then what a clown show.” \\xa0 “I consider Marjorie Taylor Greene to be my friend. She’s still my friend,” Higgins said in a video cut straight to social media shortly after the motion to vacate was filed, “but she just made a big mistake.” A member of the Freedom Caucus, Higgins split with GOP brass on both spending packages and opposes more funding for Ukraine. He still backs the speaker, however. “Brotherhood is the respect that you extend to your brother to fight his fight,” Higgins says of the withering criticism Johnson now faces. “He’s never been attacked the way that he is suffering now that he’s the speaker, which is almost an impossible job in the best of circumstances.” \\xa0 “People get pissed off up here, brother, and they say shit they don’t mean,” Higgins says of Greene’s assertion that the speaker betrayed his Christian identity. “Character,” he added, “really emerges when you do not smash somebody who has given you cause to smash them.” \\xa0 Johnson has not retaliated against members of his party for defying his leadership, and there was a feeling that Greene’s revolt might be a mutiny of one. Then Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican and perennial thorn in the side of each speaker he has served with, co-sponsored the motion to vacate and called on Johnson to resign. Asked what the final straw was, foreign aid or a recent bill renewing FISA, Massie responded on Twitter “all of the above.” The libertarian added, “This camel has a pallet of bricks.” \\xa0 ‘Code of Faith’ \\xa0 His sudden elevation brought with it an evolution for Johnson. As a member of the Judiciary Committee, he once railed against what he saw as abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Then Johnson walked into a sensitive compartmented information facility. \\xa0 “We got so spun up and so frustrated by it, at one point, we thought about getting rid of the statute,” he recalls of his initial frustrations with FISA as a rank-and-file member. “And then I went to the skiff,” says the man now second in line to the presidency, “and heard classified briefings and how critically important it is to national security.” It was conversations with the likes of former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former House Intel Chair Devin Nunes that changed his mind. “They said, ‘We’ve gotta have it; this is why we haven’t had another 9/11 on our shores.’” With their counsel, Johnson explains, “I became a champion of that. I don’t want innocent Americans to die.” \\xa0 And prior to picking up the gavel, Johnson never supported aid for Ukraine either. \\xa0 “I really do believe the intel and in the briefings that we’ve gotten,” Johnson told reporters ahead of the vote on a foreign assistance plan now seemingly tied to his own fate. “I believe Xi and Vladimir Putin and Iran really are an axis of evil,” he said, warning that Moscow could potentially move further into Europe if not stopped in Ukraine. “To put it bluntly, I would rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys.” \\xa0 After a bruising fight with his own party to renew FISA, but before bringing Ukraine funding to the floor for a vote, the speaker decamped for Mar-a-Lago. The meeting with former President Donald Trump had been on the books for weeks, he says. Unlike the rest of Washington, Trump already knows Johnson well. \\xa0 Like most Republicans, Johnson has a favorite Trump story. Before becoming speaker, he did a pretty decent Trump impression. They first spoke when the congressman was himself jamming GOP leadership, refusing to vote for an Obamacare repeal package that didn’t go far enough in his estimation. The call came one morning as Johnson was finishing his devotions in his office (where he lived). The president wanted him to vote yes on the bill. The congressman stubbornly explained why he had to vote no. \\xa0 His Bible was open to the Book of Daniel at the time, Johnson was once fond of telling friends, specifically the passage where Daniel interprets the dreams of Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar. And the congressman felt compelled to tell Trump that, once their call ended, he would pray for the president. The line went quiet. Trump broke the silence: “Tell God, I say hi.” \\xa0 Johnson still lives in his office when he’s in Washington, although he has since dropped the impression. And either incidentally or by design, the former president offered the speaker a lifeline. “He’s doing a really good job under very tough circumstances, and I appreciate that he came to Mar-a-Lago,” Trump said of Johnson at a press conference. But what about his most faithful disciple in Congress? Trump reiterated that Johnson was doing “about as good as you’re going to do,” adding that “I’m sure Marjorie understands that.” \\xa0 For the speaker, the press conference couldn’t have gone any better. “We delivered the message we needed to deliver,” he says. The trip was important, he adds, because it demonstrated “a unified front for our party,” showing “that our soon-to-be nominee for president and the House leadership here, and the speaker, are 100% in line on our agenda.” \\xa0 Trump and Johnson – whom the former president once dubbed “MAGA Mike” – couldn’t be more different in temperament. Trump, for instance, once remarked that his greatest contribution to the GOP might just be that he taught Republicans to fight. Johnson, for his part, likely wishes they’d stop fighting one another. \\xa0 In March, at the sprawling Greenbriar Resort in the mountains of West Virginia, Emmer sought a pragmatic peace. “We don’t have to like each other; we have to respect one another,” he told Republicans gathered for the GOP policy retreat. \\xa0 “I have to differ with the whip,” Johnson told the conference, “the Bible teaches us to love one another even if we don’t like each other.” \\xa0 “I can’t imagine John Boehner saying something like that without everyone laughing,” McCaul said of the former speaker famous for smoking Camels and swirling Merlot while in Congress and later lobbying for weed industry once out of it. “But everyone knows Mike is sincere.” \\xa0 It wasn’t his first sermon. At another retreat, this one in Miami the month before, an exasperated GOP member anonymously griped to Politico about the speaker’s scriptural references: “I’m not at church.” The press was far less charitable. There isn’t much dirt on Johnson. But there was plenty of gawking at the strange Southern gentleman who makes no secret of his faith. \\xa0 Slate asserted that his covenant marriage, an arrangement not uncommon among evangelicals that sets a higher bar for divorce, reflected a “radical marital strategy.” The New Republic mistook a passing remark about prayer during his acceptance speech as “a gross gaffe.” Rolling Stone implied that Johnson and his son’s use of software to filter out explicit material online was somehow meant to do the opposite. \\xa0 The speaker isn’t angry at such clueless coverage. He is just disappointed. What he is espousing in his personal life, without mandating it for anyone else, Johnson believes, isn’t all that different than what was normal in previous generations, or just a few decades ago. Namely, the expectation that lawmakers have “a moral center,” he says, adding, “Washington doesn’t know what to do with a person who actually lives by a code of faith and doesn’t just talk about it.” \\xa0 But the more extreme MAGA apologists see things differently. “If we’re gonna be biblical,” Greene says in her office, “we can say we’re supposed to judge them by the fruit they bear, right?” The congresswoman, who recently pointed to an earthquake and the solar eclipse as signs of coming divine judgement, is no less religious in her own way. “God isn’t afraid of battle or conflict,” she notes, citing the story of Jesus driving the money changers out of the temple. “Anger,” she concludes, “can be righteous.” \\xa0 A Way Forward? \\xa0 But anger doesn’t counter arithmetic erosion. The GOP majority has been evaporating as members retire early rather than serve out their full terms, and Johnson can now only lose one vote on legislation. The defining story of his speakership, explains Dusty Johnson, is just “what a lousy hand of cards he was dealt.” \\xa0 “If this was a movie,” the South Dakota congressman says, there would be a moment where the speaker would walk onto the House floor and deliver a speech so perfect that “through sheer force of oratory, he would bend the will of the United States government. That is not the way real progress happens in democratic republic.” \\xa0 A final tragedy or early triumph for Johnson may be imminent. His far right wing is in open rebellion over a foreign aid package that does not include border security reforms. Challengers are reportedly lining up support to replace him. Leadership elections, and the chaos that follows, loom. Would he remove the sword that dangles above his head? \\xa0 “Having a single motion, I don’t think anyone in the building believes that’s a good idea because it creates a real hindrance to the process itself,” Johnson says in his office this past Monday. It shouldn’t be just erased in the next Congress, he continues: “There should be a motion, but the threshold should be higher. And I think 99% of the people here probably agree.” \\xa0 Another avenue of temporary salvation exists. An ironic one. Some on the left have vowed publicly that they would ride to the rescue of the most socially conservative speaker in recent memory. Does he have any faith in those promises? \\xa0 “I have lots of friends in the building,” the speaker says, and “I’ve had a handful of Democrats approach me on the floor and say, ‘Hey, don’t worry about the motion to vacate.’” He doesn’t entertain those conversations, Johnson insists. \\xa0 The speaker was swept into office in an instant, and he could leave just as quickly. There was hope that Johnson could lead Republicans out of the wilderness, that he could hold together a fractured caucus long enough not just to maintain but grow the GOP majority. He still might. The speaker came into leadership trusting in Providence, and he now trusts his fate to the same. \\xa0 “We are actually called to bless even those who persecute us and return good for evil,” he says, citing biblical admonishment when asked about the attacks on his character. “And I get a lot of practice in all of that every day now, more than I aspire to.” \\xa0 “I don’t hold grudges,” he says. “I easily forgive, and that’s required a lot these days.” This, the speaker says as his fate remains uncertain, “is a liberating way to live.” \\xa0 ### \\n\\nTags: \\n Tweet\\n Share\\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tH-232, The Capitol\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWashington, D.C. 20515\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t202-225-4000\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t ©2024 U.S. House of Representatives.

The funding will help BECMA’s efforts to support small Black-owned businesses and Black entrepreneurs through technical assistance and other tools and services. “For generations, Black families have been systematically denied the opportunity to build wealth, and this precise, intentional federal investment in our Black small business owners and entrepreneurs will help us close the glaring racial wealth gap right here in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts” said Rep. Pressley. “As representative for one of the most unequal districts in this country, I am proud to have secured this robust funding alongside my colleague Senator Warren to help our communities thrive.” “BECMA’s work to help address the Black wealth gap in the Commonwealth is powerfully important, and this federal funding that Rep. Ayanna Pressley, Senator Markey and I helped secure is one of the best ways we can continue to support BECMA’s crucial mission of supporting Black-owned businesses,” said Sen. Warren. “I was delighted to celebrate this funding today and I’m going to keep fighting for federal investments and efforts to help close the Black wealth gap.” Congresswoman Pressley and Senator Warren were joined at the roundtable by BECMA President Nicole Obi and Black small business owners supported by BECMA’s Back Office Support Services (BOSS) program. “The Black Economic Council of Massachusetts is thankful for Congresswoman Pressley and Senator Warren’s leadership in securing BECMA $1 million in federal funding to help us continue our work to build and sustain Black wealth across the Commonwealth,” said Nicole Obi, President and CEO at the Black Economic Council of Massachusetts. “This critical funding supports BECMA’s Back Office Support Services (BOSS) program, which provides our members with access to working capital grants, digital tools, and professional services to help them launch and scale their firms.” “We are so grateful to Congresswoman Pressley and Senator Warren for prioritizing support for small, diverse businesses like ours,” said Denise O’Marde, Owner of Cafe Juice Up in Mattapan. “We are also deeply appreciative to our BECMA family for providing us access to the critical resources and services that help us stabilize our operations and thrive.” “Thank you to Congresswoman Pressley and Senator Warren for advocating for organizations like BECMA that support Black-owned businesses,” said Shana Bryant, Founder and CEO of Shana Bryant Consulting. “BECMA has provided invaluable\\xa0support to my firm that expanded our HR infrastructure and capacity, including a $10,000 BOSS grant that helped to cover the interest for a financing loan.” “Thank you to BECMA for providing support for my business at a critical time and to Rep. Pressley and Senator Warren for their leadership,” said Abdllahi “Mash” Abdirahman, Founder and Owner of Butterfly Falafel. “I encourage them to continue to prioritize diversity, equity, and inclusion in their work and to ensure that federal funding reaches Black businesses and communities directly.” Footage from the roundtable and press conference can be found here, and photos are here. Rep. Pressley\\xa0secured the federal funding\\xa0for the program in the Fiscal Year 2023 government spending package that passed Congress and was signed into law by President Biden in December 2022.

       " 'Today, Congressman Henry Cuellar, Ph.D. (TX-28) announced $3,120,000 in federal funds for schoolyard forestry in Laredo. The funds, awarded by the Texas A&M Forestry Service, were made possible by the Inflation Reduction Act, which Dr. Cuellar helped pass in 2022. “Quality campus amenities encourage a positive learning environment for our students. The funds announced today for the Adelante con Arboles project will deliver a unique urban forestry solution for Laredo students as they learn more about the natural wonders of our world,” said Dr. Cuellar. “I applaud the Texas A&M Forest Service for utilizing federal dollars made available through the Inflation Reduction Act to invest in South Texas. Thank you to Dr. Sylvia Guerra Rios, Superintendent of LISD, and Tricia Cortez, Executive Director of RGISC, for working with me to secure these funds for Laredo students.” “Beyond beautifying our schools, these trees will play an important role in making our campuses feel more welcoming and attractive,” stated LISD Superintendent of Schools Dr. Sylvia G. Rios. “Our students will watch these trees grow and connect them to their fond memories of their educational experience at LISD.” “More importantly, these trees will also serve as useful tools to teach our students about the world around them and the importance as well as responsibility we all share in nurturing our environment,” Dr. Rios exclaimed. “We are so grateful to be the recipients of such a generous grant, and as such, we are committed to working alongside our community partners to positively impact the world in which we live,” reiterated Dr. Rios. “This is a special day for such an announcement; not only is it taking place on Earth Day, but it represents a new step forward for our South Texas border city. This Laredo project was one of only five selected from across Texas, and it speaks to the commitment of our community to increase native tree canopy at Laredo ISD, provide outdoor learning opportunities for students, and begin to address climate change and severe urban heat island in the inner city,” said Tricia Cortez, Executive Director of RGISC. This award will help the Laredo Independent School District (LISD) and Rio Grande International Study Center (RGISC) implement their Adelante con Arboles project to plant trees and increase tree canopy coverage by 30% across eight Laredo schools: The project will provide students with greater opportunities for outdoor education, raise environmental awareness, create special outdoor areas for children with autism, and address the shortage of certified arborists in Laredo. This year, the Texas A&M Forestry Service announced a historic $15.4 million in grant funding through its Forestry Grant Program. The goal of the program is to build healthier urban and community forests throughout the state which are essential for the economic, environmental, physical and mental well-being of all Texans. Funding for the program significantly increased from $100,000 in 2022 to $16.65 million in 2023 as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act. ### Hoy, el congresista Henry Cuellar, Ph.D. (TX-28) anunció $3,120,000 en fondos federales para la silvicultura en los patios escolares de Laredo. Los fondos, otorgados por el Servicio Forestal de Texas A&M, fueron posibles gracias a la Ley de Reducción de la Inflación, que el Dr. Cuellar ayudó a aprobar en 2022. “Las comodidades de calidad del campus fomentan un ambiente de aprendizaje positivo para nuestros estudiantes. Los fondos anunciados hoy para el proyecto Adelante con Árboles brindarán una solución forestal urbana única para los estudiantes de Laredo a medida que aprenden más sobre las maravillas naturales de nuestro mundo,” dijo el Dr. Cuellar. “Aplaudo al Servicio Forestal de Texas A&M por utilizar dólares federales disponibles a través de la Ley de Reducción de la Inflación para invertir en el sur de Texas. Gracias a la Dra. Sylvia Guerra Ríos, Superintendente de LISD, y a Tricia Cortez, directora ejecutiva de RGISC, por trabajar conmigo para asegurar estos fondos para los estudiantes de Laredo.” “Más allá de embellecer nuestras escuelas, estos árboles desempeñarán un papel importante para hacer que nuestros campus se sientan más acogedores y atractivos,” afirmó la Superintendente de Escuelas de LISD, Dra. Sylvia G. Ríos. “Nuestros estudiantes verán crecer estos árboles y los conectarán con los gratos recuerdos de su experiencia educativa en LISD.” “Más importante aún, estos árboles también servirán como herramientas útiles para enseñar a nuestros estudiantes sobre el mundo que los rodea y la importancia y la responsabilidad que todos compartimos en el cuidado de nuestro medio ambiente,” exclamó Dr. Ríos. “Estamos muy agradecidos de recibir una subvención tan generosa y, como tal, estamos comprometidos a trabajar junto con nuestros socios comunitarios para impactar positivamente el mundo en el que vivimos,” reiteró Dr. Ríos. “Este es un día especial para tal anuncio; no sólo se llevará a cabo en el Día de la Tierra, sino que representa un nuevo paso adelante para nuestra ciudad fronteriza del sur de Texas. Este proyecto de Laredo fue uno de los cinco seleccionados en todo Texas y habla del compromiso de nuestra comunidad de aumentar la copa de los árboles nativos en Laredo ISD, brindar oportunidades de aprendizaje al aire libre para los estudiantes y comenzar a abordar el cambio climático y la isla de calor urbano severo en el centro de la ciudad,” dijo Tricia Cortez, directora ejecutiva de RGISC. Este premio ayudará al Distrito Escolar Independiente de Laredo (LISD) y al Centro de Estudios Internacionales Rio Grande (RGISC) a implementar su proyecto Adelante con Árboles para plantar árboles y aumentar la cobertura de copas de árboles en un 30% en ocho escuelas de Laredo: El proyecto brindará a los estudiantes mayores oportunidades de educación al aire libre, creará conciencia ambiental, creará áreas especiales al aire libre para niños con autismo y abordará la escasez de arbolistas certificados en Laredo. Este año, el Servicio Forestal de Texas A&M anunció una histórica donación de $15,4 millones en subvenciones a través de su Programa de Subvenciones Forestales. El objetivo del programa es construir bosques urbanos y comunitarios más saludables en todo el estado, que son esenciales para el bienestar económico, ambiental, físico y mental de todos los tejanos. La financiación del programa aumentó significativamente de $100,000 en 2022 a $16,65 millones en 2023 como resultado de la Ley de Reducción de la Inflación. ###',\n",
       " 'U.S. Congressman Washington, D.C. -\\xa0Congressman Michael C. Burgess, M.D. (R-TX), Chairman of the House Rules Committee, joined the Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee in questioning Secretary Xavier Becerra of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on the Fiscal Year 2025 Department of HHS Budget.\\n\\r\\nChairman Burgess highlighted the Biden Administration\\'s failed attempts of enhancing the wellbeing of Americans and questioned Secretary Becerra on what the Administration is doing to curb health care consolidation, preserve independent practices and small providers, and address high health care costs.\\xa0 Click\\xa0HERE\\xa0for Video. \\nOn the importance of preserving independent practice and addressing provider consolidation:\\n “Would you agree that provider consolidation is a problem that needs to be addressed?,”\\xa0asked Chairman Burgess.\\xa0\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s something we\\'ve had forever, there\\'s no reason why consolidation should mean that there shouldn\\'t be independent practice,\"\\xa0said Secretary Becerra.\\xa0\\n \"I’m glad you feel that way. I think that the presence of independent physicians is an invaluable counterweight to the rise of consolidation in our health care marketplace. What is this Administration doing to help preserve independent practice as an option for physicians and patients?”\\xa0asked Chairman Burgess.\\n \"We continue to work within the industry to make sure that no consolidation is occurring for monopolistic purposes. We work with the Department of Justice on that. We try to keep prices competitive. I would probably agree with you if you were to ask me if removing those independent practitioners is going to lead to higher prices and I would probably tell you it absolutely does,\"\\xa0said Secretary Becerra. \"It\\'s going to lead the worst patient care and\\xa0that\\'s really what we should be concerned about. I mean it\\'s one thing to spend a lot of money, it\\'s another thing to spend a lot of money and not deliver the care that people really need,\"\\xa0said Chairman Burgess.\\n \\xa0 On requesting commitment from the Biden administration to address the current disruptive payment rules, preserve independent practice, reduce health care consolidation, and lower costs for American patients:\\n \"Would you consider modifying the upcoming Physician Fee Schedule so that it does not involve the large budget neutrality adjustment and offers facility physicians stability, in cost contrast to many decades of disruptive payment rules?\"\\xa0asked Chairman Burgess.\\n\\n\"That\\'s a dance we have to engage with together. Congress set the rules, the new budget neutrality rules we have to follow. More than willing to work with you because again, if it doesn\\'t really deal with the reality of what the practitioner on the ground has to face, we all should take a closer look.\"\\xa0said Secretary Becerra.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\"Well\\xa0here\\'s the problem. We need to ensure that this year\\'s physician fee schedule doesn\\'t continue the cycle of large budget neutrality adjustments that drive conversion factors down for providers,\"\\xa0said Chairman Burgess.\\n\\n\"So look, we got a problem. The Affordable\\xa0Care Act to CMMI was also going to save money, it doesn\\'t. Poorly constructed models favoring large health organizations, consistent, disruptive payment rules, driving consolidation. What we just heard this week about the change health care problems driving consolidation.\\xa0It seems intuitively obvious to the casual observer that this Administration prefers larger health care systems and neglect smaller providers. For example, why hasn\\'t this Administration embraced ideas, such as site neutral payment reform to lower costs for the patients and reduced consolidation, something that has been included in President\\'s budget\\'s for over a decade?\"\\xa0asked Chairman Burgess.\\n \"I\\'d be more than willing to discuss with you the ways that we have continued to try to sustain the smaller providers because the smaller providers are typically the ones that are in rural America. They\\'re typically the ones that are in lower income America, and we desperately need to keep them in place. We have promulgated a number of policies that support smaller providers. We want to avoid them being gobbled up by the big guys,\"\\xa0said Secretary Becerra. \"Here\\'s a pro tip. Site neutrality can replace budget neutrality. We can afford this. We have the dollars within the system, we can afford to do this, it is just the will to deliver on that,\"\\xa0said Chairman Burgess.\\xa0\\n\\n\"What is the cost per enrollee in the Affordable Care Act?\"\\xa0asked Chairman Burgess.\\n \"That would depend on the plan that they purchase, what their income level is, what the level of subsidy would be.\"\\xa0said Secretary Becerra. \"You say that the cost of care is basically cost plus to Americans but it\\'s not. Americans are paying this bill, and now they\\'re paying highest interest rates on the money they\\'re having to borrow for what you\\'re giving away,\"\\xa0said Chairman Burgess.\\n\\n\\n\\n ### Get the most up to date news from me on Twitter.',\n",

       " 'Roughly six months after the brutal attacks by the Iranian-backed Hamas terrorists, the world watched as Iran launched its own direct and unprecedented attack on Israel. As our closest ally in the Middle East faces more threats to their very existence, it’s important now more than ever that Congress stands up to authoritarian aggression to support Israel.  While I’m sure words of well wishes for our ally are appreciated, it’s sound and expeditious policy that will make an impact in Israel’s fight to defend itself. That’s why House Republicans acted swiftly this week to bring a slate of bills, including several I cosponsored, to stand with Israel and respond to Iran’s heinous attacks. It’s known that Iran is one of the world’s foremost sponsors of terrorism. Yet, in 2008, the Obama Administration set an unruly precedent of appeasing Iran, which Biden has compounded since he took office.  Most recently, as the Iranian-backed Hamas terrorists were planning their attacks, the Biden Administration waived sanctions to allow $6 billion in Iranian funds to be transferred to banks in Qatar and later reissued a waiver that gave Iran access to more than $10 billion. The Iranian regime is highly skilled in evasion, cutting corners, and blurring lines to hide the true use of these funds, and the Biden Administration is compliant and complicit in these efforts. Any funding given to Iran, even if nominally in a restricted account, frees up funds for them to use on malign activities. Iran is too potent a threat for these waivers to exist any longer, so the House voted to pass a bill I cosponsored, H.R. 5947, to eliminate any waivers and licenses related to Iran that would allow Biden to take such actions again. I will not stand by while the Biden Administration continues to show weakness on the world stage. I will continue working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to advance comprehensive policies to prioritize the security of the U.S. and our allies.',\n",

       " \"Washington, D.C. – Today, Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries spoke on the House Floor against pro-Putin extremists who have obstructed our national security and in support of the urgent bipartisan national security package to stand with our allies and protect the American people. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the legislative package that is before the Congress.\\xa0For months, the national security priorities of the American people have been obstructed by pro-Putin extremists determined to let Russia win. A bipartisan coalition of Democrats and Republicans has risen up to work together and ensure that we are getting the national security legislation important to the American people over the finish line. House Democrats have risen to the occasion. President Joe Biden has risen to the occasion. Traditional conservatives led by Speaker Mike Johnson have risen to the occasion. We have a responsibility, not as Democrats or Republicans but as Americans, to do what is necessary to defend democracy wherever it is at risk in the best interest of the free world.\\xa0That is what this legislation represents. We have a responsibility to push back against tyranny. We have a responsibility to push back against totalitarianism. We have a responsibility to push back against terror. And we have a responsibility to stand with our democratic allies throughout the world. Israel is a democratic ally. Ukraine is a democratic ally. South Korea is a democratic ally. Taiwan is a democratic ally. Japan is a democratic ally.\\xa0We have a responsibility to stand with our democratic allies throughout the world. We also have a responsibility to push back against our adversaries.\\xa0Russia is not our friend. The Chinese Communist Party is not our friend. Iran is not our friend. We have a special relationship that exists between the United States and Israel. It’s a relationship that is anchored in shared values and shared interests. Our commitment to Israel’s security is ironclad. Israel has a right to exist as a Jewish and democratic state and safe haven for the Jewish people, who have faced centuries of persecution throughout the years.\\xa0The events of October 7 make clear that Hamas must be decisively defeated for the good of Israel, for the good of the Palestinian people, for the good of peace in the Middle East, for the good of the free world.\\xa0Hamas must be decisively defeated. At the same time, there are other urgent priorities.\\xa0We must do everything possible to make sure that we are freeing the hostages so they can safely return to their families and do everything possible to surge humanitarian assistance into Gaza so we can help out Palestinian civilians who are in harm’s way through no fault of their own.\\xa0We must surge in food, surge in medicine, surge in humanitarian assistance. That is what this package will help accomplish with more than $9 billion in humanitarian assistance. The events of October 7 and the suffering of Palestinian civilians in a theater of war a heartbreaking.\\xa0 Any person of goodwill should come to the conclusion that we have to find a way to achieve a just and lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinian people. And the only way for that to happen is for us to truly commit to a two-state solution when the moment presents itself with a safe and secure Israel living side by side in peace and prosperity with a demilitarized Palestinian state that provides dignity and self-determination for the Palestinian people. Let us recommit to accomplishing that objective.\\xa0The humanitarian assistance in this legislative package will also allow the United States to be there to support people who are suffering all across the world, including millions in Haiti and millions in the Sudan dealing with famine and starvation in a war-torn environment.\\xa0This legislation, of course, will allow us to stand with our allies in the Indo-Pacific in the face of continued aggression from the Chinese Communist Party\\xa0to make sure that freedom and democracy and these values all across the world will continue to be triumphant. This legislation will allow us to support the bravery and the courage of the Ukrainian people, who, against all odds, continue to stand for what we as Americans believe in. In February of 2022, we were told that Ukraine would likely fall in a week and that Russian troops would be in Kiev in a week. But the bravery, the courage, the resilience of the Ukrainian people in the face of the most powerful military in Europe has proven to be consequential in partnership with American support and that of our NATO allies. But\\xa0the Ukrainian people have taught us something, that in the face of an incredible military apparatus that they were confronting, against all odds, that when a people believe in freedom or liberty or democracy, that can overcome even the mightiest of militaries.\\xa0And so we’ve seen them, despite the prediction that they would fall in a week, inflict more than 300,000 casualties on the Russian military, significant portions of the Russian navy wiped out in the Black Sea, more than half the territory that had initially been seized by the Russian military recaptured by Ukraine against all odds. But\\xa0the pro-Putin obstruction that has stopped this national security legislation from advancing to the floor until this point risks all of the progress that has been made, which is why it’s so essential for us to do what is necessary to stand with the Ukrainian people.

       " 'April 19, 2024  Dear Friend,  This week, the dysfunctional Republican leadership finally produced bills for aid to Israel and Ukraine and scheduled a vote for Saturday. The support for Ukraine is long overdue, and I will vote in favor of it, in addition to aid to Israel and for the civilian population of Gaza. I also met in my Washington office with the President of the University of Tennessee and the Chancellor of Rutgers University-Camden, planned to attend next week’s grand opening of the Orange Mound Library in the former Melrose High School, condemned the current Turkish government for human rights abuses, welcomed the Senate’s quick dismissal of the spurious impeachment charges against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, offered some guidance on President Biden’s most recent effort to reduce student loan debt, and offered a health tip tied to warming temperatures. Keep reading and follow me on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to see what I am doing as it happens.  Expecting to Vote for Aid to Support Israel and Ukraine Meeting with University President and Chancellor Looking Forward to the Grand Opening of the Orange Mound Library Condemning Turkey’s Political Oppression Welcoming Dismissal of Mayorkas Impeachment Hoax Offering Guidance on Student Loan Forgiveness Weekly Health Tip Quote of the Week Expecting to Vote for Aid to Support Israel and Ukraine  The dysfunctional Republican leadership of the House has finally scheduled votes on aid to Israel and to Ukraine for Saturday, and I will vote for both measures. The delay in offering support to Ukraine has resulted in reversals on the battlefield and additional loss of life from both military and civilian populations, so providing this assistance is crucial. The measures will also provide military aid to Israel and humanitarian aid to the starving civilian population of Gaza, as well as assistance to Taiwan. Iran’s shooting 300 drones, rockets and missiles at Israel brought this issue to the fore with the need to replenish Israel’s weapons supply. Depending on the outcome Saturday, Speaker Mike Johnson could be seen as a profile in courage for risking his political career for a noble cause. I commend him for scheduling these votes and will support him if there is a motion, as threatened, to vacate the speakership.  Meeting with University President and Chancellor  Chancellor Tillis, Congressman Cohen and President Boyd On Wednesday, University of Tennessee President Randy Boyd and Rutgers University-Camden Chancellor Antonio Tillis visited my Washington office to discuss their education priorities. With President Boyd, we discussed the Tennessee Lottery I passed as a state Senator that provides so many scholarships to U.T. students and others. With Chancellor Tillis, I commended him on his commitment to attracting talented students from Memphis to his prestigious New Jersey university, particularly the “pipeline” he has created between Rutgers and Hamilton High School.  Condemning Turkey’s Political Oppression  My late Congressional colleague Tom Lantos was a champion of human rights, and I am proud to be a member of the commission created in his name. The Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission held a hearing on Tuesday with expert witnesses on the ongoing oppression in Turkey. Among the hearing witnesses was Enes Kanter Freedom, a human rights activist and former NBA basketball player who was punished by the NBA for expressing his political views about the lack of human rights in China. See my questioning of witnesses here.\\xa0  Looking Forward to Orange Mound Library Grand Opening Next Friday, April 26, I plan to attend the grand opening of the Orange Mound Library at the former Melrose High School for which I secured $3 million in community project funding. The transformation of the school is an inspiring example of what happens when federal funding is invested in our community.  Welcoming Dismissal of Mayorkas Impeachment Hoax  The U.S. Senate made fast work of the meritless impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Wednesday, dismissing both baseless charges in less than three hours. I voted against the impeachment hoax and was pleased to see the Senate toss it aside without debate. Sadly, many in the press wondered if this kind of spectacle means the Senate is becoming like the House – a political, not a policy-based chamber.  Offering Guidance on Student Loan Forgiveness President Biden’s latest action to erase student loan debt is projected to extend relief to more than 30 million Americans. This is benefiting people of all ages — from young people who are new to the job market to moms and dads who have been paying off old loans with sky-high interest rates for years.\\xa0The new plan will cancel runaway interest for millions; it will automatically cancel debt for borrowers who are eligible for programs like SAVE and PSLF but just haven’t applied; it will cancel debt for borrowers who entered repayment decades ago and for people who enrolled in programs with low –financial value programs; and it will provide debt relief for people who are experiencing serious financial hardship. The Biden Administration has already helped four million people save $146 billion on student loan debt, and this is another big step in the right direction.\\xa0  Weekly Health Tip  Besides the cicadas we anticipate seeing as temperatures rise, the heat also brings mosquito season to our region.

       " \"502 Cannon HOB, Washington, DC 20515Email Me(202) 225-6435 On April 13, Israel endured an unprecedented attack of more than 300 long-range missiles and drones from Iran. The Islamic Republic of Iran has been a sworn enemy of Israel since the 1979 Iranian revolution and is the primary state sponsor of terrorist groups such as Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthi movement in Yemen. However, Iranian forces had never launched a direct barrage against Israel from its own territory prior to last week. Miraculously, 99 percent of the projectiles were intercepted by Israel’s Iron Dome and David’s Sling defense systems and a coalition including American, British, French, Jordanian, and Saudi forces. This demonstrated the vital need for such defense systems and the hard-won success of U.S.-led cooperation with regional partners to promote security. It’s an understatement to say Israel is in a dangerous neighborhood; Iran and its proxies have sworn to eliminate the state. Without the historic Abraham Accords negotiated by the Trump administration in 2020 and the subsequent intelligence coordination with Arab countries, thwarting Iran’s bombardment to such a degree may not have been possible. In the face of Iran's attack, our ally Israel deserves our full support. Tensions between the two Middle East nations have run high for decades, and the sheer scale of Iran’s attack is a blatant escalation which must be met with solidarity and strength. This week, the House considered a resolution I cosponsored condemning this attack and affirming Israel’s right to self-defense. It passed by a vote of 404-14. I am also a cosponsor of the No U.S. Financing for Iran Act (H.R.5921) and the Standing Against Houthi Aggression Act (H.R.6046). Both passed the House this week with my support. The Biden administration has made the mistakes of relaxing economic sanctions on Iran and weakening terrorist designations for the Houthis who have been committing acts of terror in the Red Sea, disrupting one of the world’s busiest shipping routes, since the October 7 attacks by Hamas. While President Biden sought to make $6 billion available to Iran in an August 2023 appeasement deal, H.R. 5921 would increase financial pressure on the government of Iran. H.R. 6046 would fully reinstate Houthi terrorist designations removed by the administration in 2021. Since the devastating and tragic October 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas, the terrorist group continues to hold hostages, including American citizens. Very troublingly, it cannot account for the number of hostages they once were thought to have. Hamas must ensure the safe release of all hostages. Israel certainly has the right to respond to the attacks they have suffered, and they are still responding. It is important for us to stand behind Israel and our friends around the world who seek to do the right thing. Israel will need to replenish critical munitions and its defense systems following the onslaught by Iran. We should likewise do what we can to share the resources they need to stand for the cause of freedom. ###\",\n",
       " 'April 20, 2024 WASHINGTON\\xa0– Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) issued the following statement on her votes today on the House’s votes on foreign military aid packages for Israel, Ukraine..\\xa0 Yesterday, Rep. Pressley filed a pair of amendments to increase funding to global humanitarian assistance and place a one-year moratorium on the transfer of offensive weapons to the Israeli military. The amendments were not adopted in the final legislation.\\xa0 “In this moment of growing global conflict, I have consistently advocated for policies and budgets that save lives, promote de-escalation, and work toward peace across the globe. “It is unconscionable that Congress would consider sending more offensive weapons and funding to the Israeli military, which for months has operated with callous disregard for human life in Gaza and perpetrated significant human rights violations. Over 34,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces, millions of civilians in Gaza are on the brink of famine, and over 100 hostages are still held captive by Hamas. While I support Israel’s right to defend itself—especially following the horrific October 7th attack and I grieve deeply for those impacted—we cannot bomb our way to peace and become complicit as the Netaynahu government continues to massacre the Palestinian people. I voted NO on H.R. 8034 and continue to call for the United States to facilitate a lasting, bilateral ceasefire to save lives, return all hostages, deliver meaningful humanitarian aid to Gaza, and negotiate a long-term diplomatic solution that results in a just and lasting peace for Israelis and Palestinians alike.” “I also believe Congress should provide long-overdue assistance to help the Ukrainian people defend themselves against Vladimir Putin’s unjust and illegal invasion. This conflict has claimed the lives of tens of thousands of innocent people and displaced millions of others, and my heart breaks for the Ukrainian and Russian civilians who have had to deal with this unspeakable trauma. While I never take a vote on military aid lightly and believe diplomacy and humanitarian aid should be the priority, we have an obligation to stop Putin’s unjust invasion. I voted YES on H.R. 8035. “I am encouraged that Democrats were able to secure some global humanitarian aid in these bills, which will help mitigate these worsening crises. However, I am deeply disappointed that the Republican majority did not consider my amendment to drastically surge humanitarian aid to address the crises in Gaza and Ukraine, as well as in Haiti, Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan, and others. We must continue to prioritize global humanitarian assistance, including restoring critical funding for UNWRA. “As a parent, woman of faith, and caregiver, I pray that we can build a world where all of our children can thrive and know peace, whether they’re in Massachusetts, Gaza, Ukraine, Israel, or Haiti.”\\xa0 Since the horrific October 7th attack, Congresswoman Pressley has consistently and stridently called for a ceasefire to save lives, return all hostages, and surge humanitarian aid to Gaza. This week, Rep. Pressley\\xa0delivered a floor speech\\xa0in which she called or urgent de-escalation in the Middle East and renewed her calls for a ceasefire in Gaza to prevent a broader regional war. As Co-Chair of the House Haiti Caucus, Rep. Pressley has also led calls for\\xa0extending Temporary Protected Status\\xa0for Haiti, a\\xa0halt to deportations, a Haitian-led democratic transition, the\\xa0delivery of humanitarian, economic and security assistance\\xa0to the island, and more. Throughout the Israel and Hamas conflict, Rep. Pressley has been a vocal and consistent advocate of diplomacy, de-escalation, and saving lives. ### Washington DC Office 402 Cannon HOB\\r\\nWashington, DC 20515 Phone (202) 225-5111\\r\\nFax (202) 225-9322 District Office 1295 River Street\\r\\nHyde Park, MA 02136 Phone (617) 850-0040\\r\\nFax (202) 225-9322',\n",

Today is, in many ways, Congress’ first official vote where we can weigh in on the direction of this war.\\xa0If Congress votes to continue to supply offensive military aid, we make ourselves complicit in this tragedy.\\xa0 “Our votes against H.R. 8034 are votes against supplying more offensive weapons that could result in more killings of civilians in Rafah and elsewhere. We believe strongly in Israel’s right to self-defense and have joined colleagues previously in affirming our shared commitment. “All of us support strengthening the Iron Dome and other defense systems and we are committed to a sovereign, safe, and secure future for Israel. To protect that future, we believe the United States must help achieve a ceasefire that allows hostages to be freed, humanitarian aid to be delivered, and peace talks to begin. “Benjamin Netanyahu appears willing to sacrifice the hostages while inflicting extraordinary suffering on the people of Gaza. He is willing to expand this conflict to preserve his power at the expense of Israel’s safety. In recent weeks, reports have indicated that Netanyahu is moving closer to a full-scale invasion of the southern Gaza town of Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians have taken shelter. When faced with the question of whether to provide offensive aid to further this conflict, we believe there is a moral imperative to find another path. “Most Americans do not want our government to write a blank check to further Prime Minister Netanyahu’s war in Gaza. The United States needs to help Israel find a path to win the peace.”\\xa0 ###\\xa0 \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIssues: Foreign Affairs & National Security  \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWashington, DC Office\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t2346 Rayburn House Office Building\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWashington.

Kathy Castor (FL-14) released the below statement on House passage of the bipartisan  national security package: “Democracy and freedom won today as a bipartisan majority – 210 Democrats and 101 Republicans – voted to provide emergency security and humanitarian aid to Ukraine. Despite months of delay at the hands of MAGA Republicans, I’m confident that America and our allies will be better equipped to stand strong and united against authoritarians like Vladimir Putin. “The security package provides support for the people of Ukraine and Israel while also providing much-needed humanitarian assistance to civilians affected by conflicts – including millions of Palestinians who continue to face an urgent humanitarian crisis as water and food supplies dwindle. “This package will help Israel defend itself from Hamas and Iran by replenishing the Iron Dome missile defense system that has protected the people of Israel and was pivotal in minimizing the impact of Iran’s recent attack. “The package also provides crucial resources for U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), headquartered at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, and the operations in the Middle East area of responsibility so that our military can respond to attacks on American interests by Iranian proxies. “Strategic investments in the Indo-Pacific will deter aggression from China and help maintain peace and stability throughout the region.\\xa0 “I am thankful Speaker Johnson finally scheduled the vote, but the harm inflicted on civilians, our allies, our global standing and our national security at the hands of MAGA Republicans’ delay tactics will not be forgotten.

       " 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Representative Virginia Foxx (R-NC) issued the following statement after the House passed the National Security Supplemental that provides resources for Israel, the Indo-Pacific, Ukraine, as well as additional measures to counter foreign aggression in each region: “By allowing for a transparent and constructive process, the People’s House has created a stronger outcome of fulfilling our obligations to our allies in their time of need. The first step in quashing the possibility of a foreign war is enacting impactful deterrence measures. Without question, this is an axis versus allies moment, and deterrence is the optimal way to stop Iran, China, North Korea, and Russia in their tracks. If we were to have accepted the Senate’s blank check for foreign aid without reservation, this process would have never yielded a strong, ironclad product.  “That said, I was proud to support separate amendments during this process, specifically relating to Ukraine, with the sole intention of keeping aid targeted and narrow in scope. These amendments involved eliminating all non-military funding to Ukraine as well as to block an increase in the President’s drawdown authority and foreign military financing. Europe must also step up to the plate and ensure that Ukraine remains on a direct path to self-reliance so that this caliber of assistance is not necessary in the future. In the end, there remained a clear imperative of providing necessary assistance – and we rose to meet the moment.”',\n",
       " 'Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H. R. 4639, the Fourth Amendment Is Not For Sale Act.  As Ranking Member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, my priority is our national security and to protect Americans from foreign threats. Our Intelligence Community agencies at times purchase what is known as “commercially available information” from data brokerage companies to gather information on foreign spies and bad actors, and to protect America from malign foreign influence. When they purchase this data, they cannot be certain that it is entirely free of any U.S. citizen’s information. In order to protect citizens, agencies are already required to take steps to ensure that this incidentally obtained data is removed.  However, these data brokerage companies collect the personal information of Americans through their social media profiles, public records, and other commercial sources. They then sell this information to companies, organizations, or any entity with an interest in collecting data on American citizens – including foreign adversaries like China, Russia, or even cartels. H.R. 4639 would do nothing to keep any of these other entities from exploiting and sharing American’s data.   Instead of prohibiting our own intelligence agencies from accessing commercially available information to obtain foreign intelligence, we must take steps to address the broader vulnerability of Americans’ data. Congress needs to take steps to protect Americans, not undermine our Intelligence agencies and put the United States at a deep disadvantage against our adversaries.  Thank you, and I yield back.

       " 'FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE April 16, 2024 Congressman Trone Calls for Increased Funding for Job Training and Health Care, Improved Outcomes for the Bureau of Prisons in Hearing with AG Garland Congressman David Trone questions Attorney General Garland during the Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations Subcommittee hearing.\\xa0 WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Congressman David Trone (D-MD) questioned Attorney General Garland during a Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations Subcommittee hearing. During the hearing, Trone asked questions about the Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) staffing shortages, ID cards, telemedicine, solitary confinement, de-escalation training, clean slate laws, and the antitrust division.\\xa0 CONGRESSMAN DAVID TRONE:\\xa0Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Cartwright, and thank you, Attorney General Garland for appearing here today, and thank you for your patience as you deal with this committee.\\xa0 I’m a co-chair of the Bipartisan Second Chance Task Force, and we’re concerned about staffing shortages at the BOP. The BOP is funded at 93%.\\xa0 But we’re only staffed at 86%. What’s happening is education, wraparound services for mental health, etc, which could improve our outcomes, job training, get left behind. So we’re all in agreement on that. We’d like to figure out how to implement the bipartisan First Step Act successfully. And to do that, we’ve got to have the staffing. Could you talk a minute about what this does to lead to lousy outcomes? Where we can’t cut our prison budget because we don’t give folks a second chance to win and succeed.\\xa0\\xa0 ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND:\\xa0I do think that the money we have to provide more incentives for people to stay on the job in the Bureau of Prisons means that the chances of reducing recidivism will increase.\\xa0 CONGRESSMAN DAVID TRONE:\\xa0That sounds like a smart investment to me. Second quick question, 75 percent of BOP inmates do not have a photo ID when they leave prison. They can’t secure housing, apply for jobs, open a bank account, federal benefit programs, etc. The Bureau is addressing this by providing IDs to U. S. citizens now. We have a bipartisan bill, the\\xa0BOP Release Card Act,\\xa0that supports this effort at the BOP by ensuring new IDs fulfill all the requirements and directs BOP to work with the states to have a one-on-one exchange so we can work right with the states to move these folks into getting their new ID card and then successfully be able to exchange that for state ID cards. So we would appreciate your help in moving this bill forward. Does that make sense to you? ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND:\\xa0Yeah, we would be happy to give technical assistance. I think we may, our staff may have already, our staffs may have already consulted on this, but of course, we’d be happy to give technical assistance. The BOP has implemented its own release ID program in October of 2023 and they’re on track for implementation by this spring. CONGRESSMAN DAVID TRONE:\\xa0Excellent. Thank you. The DEA has extended current telemedicine flexibilities for prescribing controlled medications through December 31, ‘24.\\xa0 But, there’s not a revised proposed rule and many patients are at risk of losing access to prescriptions needed for mental health and substance use disorder. Last year, my colleagues and I expressed concerns about the proposed DEA rule that would have limited patient access to buprenorphine and encourage an evidence-based approach to make permanent the use of audio-only or audio-visual telehealth technology for buprenorphine prescribing. This is crucial to reach these patient populations, including unhoused, rural, and tribal. So as a follow-up to that letter, we introduced the TREATS Act, which allows medication for opioid use disorder to be prescribed via telemedicine. What’s DOJ’s position on the continued use of telehealth flexibilities to ensure access to these medically necessary substance use disorder treatments? And how is this supported in your budget request?\\xa0 ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND:\\xa0So as you noted the DEA and HHS have extended the current telemedicine flexibilities until December 31st of this year. DEA has issued a proposed rule, which would allow authorized providers to prescribe medicines for opioid use disorder via telemedicine.\\xa0 They are working to promulgate a final year by the — I’m sorry a final rule — by the fall of this year.\\xa0\\xa0 CONGRESSMAN DAVID TRONE:\\xa0Okay, excellent. Thank you very much. Just quickly, restrictive housing, otherwise known as solitary confinement, outdated, inhumane practice often used way too far too often. We believe the BOP has been dragging its feet in reforming this area of restrictive housing. In the past 10 years, DOJ has conducted studies and task forces to improve restrictive housing, yet we fail to make any progress. What steps can DOJ and BOP take together so we can make this more effective and improve restrictive housing policies?\\xa0 ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND:\\xa0Well, the new BOP director is very much committed to what you’re talking about. BOP recently published a proposed rule on discipline designed to reduce the use of restrictive housing for disciplinary segregation. BOP is trying to hire more psychologists and provide de-escalation training which would help reduce the need for restrictive housing.\\xa0 CONGRESSMAN DAVID TRONE:\\xa0Excellent. Thank you very much. I yield back.\\xa0\\xa0 SECOND ROUND OF QUESTIONING CONGRESSMAN DAVID TRONE:\\xa0Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Last year we helped pass the bipartisan Law Enforcement De-escalation Training Act, which provides 124 million in grant funding over four years for de-escalation training for police officers. This is going to save lives, improve police-community relations. Although this program is new, could you talk briefly about its implementation and more broadly how DOJ’s budget prioritizes mental health and crisis stabilization?\\xa0 ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND:\\xa0Yeah, I don’t have the specifics with respect to that program, but as a general matter, our COPS office and our Office of Justice Programs provide de-escalation, money for de-escalation training, it is an important way to protect the lives of officers and first respondents as well as the people who are calling for help. You are also right in the implication of your questions that many of these calls involve people who are mentally ill or have a mental impairment, and that the sensitivity of respondents to that possibility is an important element of the need for de-escalation.\\xa0\\xa0 CONGRESSMAN DAVID TRONE:\\xa0Thank you for your efforts there. 70 to 100 million Americans have criminal records that appear on routine background checks, often preventing them from getting jobs. Over the last seven years, my company has hired about 1,400 returning citizens, which is good for business and cuts down recidivism. Automatic clearing records are costly and have been a barrier to widespread adoption. What resources does the DOJ need to help support these clean slate laws?\\xa0\\xa0 ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND:\\xa0Well, I don’t think I’m, I’m gonna be able to, to talk to you specifically about the Clean Slate laws you know, in the area of criminal justice reform in the implementation of the Second Chance Act, which involves reentry programs, we’re asking for $125 million for those reentry programs. In addition, there is a new program called the Accelerating Justice System Reform Grants, which is a $300 million request for FY25 and $15 billion over 10 years. I’m not sure exactly whether the clean slate would fall within those, but I’ll ask my staff to get back to you on which of the grant programs go to the program here. CONGRESSMAN DAVID TRONE:\\xa0Yeah, we’d love to keep working with you. Last quick question to build on represent — Ranking Member DeLauro on the antitrust division. Should this committee take another look at the language that eliminates — stops you from having full access to the merger filing fees and locks you into that $233 million?\\xa0 ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND:\\xa0Well, I’m gonna leave it to the Members of Congress to resolve this question. The Justice Department is in favor of the antitrust division getting full access to the fees. But you know, in the end, the Congress makes those determinations.\\xa0 CONGRESSMAN DAVID TRONE:\\xa0Seems like a good idea. Thank you.\\xa0 ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND:\\xa0It does seem like a good idea. Yes.\\xa0 Congressman David Trone was elected to the House of Representatives in November 2018 to serve the 6th District of Maryland, which includes all or part of Montgomery, Frederick, Washington, Allegany, and Garrett Counties.

       " 'FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE April 19, 2024 Trone, Cárdenas Lead Introduction of Resolution Declaring April 2024 as Second Chance Month WASHINGTON, D.C.– Today, U.S. Representatives David Trone (D-MD-6), Tony Cárdenas (D-CA-29), Bruce Westerman (R-AR-4) and Don Bacon (R-NE-2) alongside U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Kevin Cramer (R-ND) reintroduced the bicameral Second Chance Month Resolution. The bicameral, bipartisan effort to designate April 2024 as Second Chance Month serves as reminder of the significant legal and societal barriers for the thousands returning from incarceration each year. In a nation that was founded on new possibilities, this resolution affirms that those who are returning home from jail or prison should have access to rehabilitation, redemption, and the chance to contribute positively to their communities. “Second Chance Month is an opportunity to recognize the importance of providing justice-impacted individuals with a real second chance at rebuilding their lives,”\\xa0said Congressman David Trone, cofounder, and co-chair of the Second Chance Task Force. “After decades of overcriminalization, our country must make progress toward putting compassion over confinement. This month — and every month — we recommit ourselves to delivering on this promise.” \\xa0“Having witnessed firsthand the injustices that countless individuals in my community have faced upon reentry, I’ve made it a priority throughout my years as an elected official to advocate for the resources to make second chances possible,”\\xa0said Congressman Tony Cárdenas. “In America every person deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, and we must continue to do everything in our power to ensure that people who were formerly incarcerated have access to reentry services and opportunities for a better tomorrow.” “Second Chance Month is an important platform to raise awareness of the challenges that formerly incarcerated individuals, who have paid their debt to society, experience in re-entering their communities,”\\xa0said Congressman Bruce Westerman. “Opportunity after incarceration is critical to breaking the cycle of crime and reducing recidivism. I’m proud to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in this effort to acknowledge that second chances are paramount in fostering safer communities.” “Sadly, many formerly incarcerated individuals return to the prison system because they haven’t been given the opportunity to benefit from rehabilitation, given a chance at a job or training, and have faced scorn from their fellow man,”\\xa0said Congressman Don Bacon. “The Second Chance Month Resolution highlights the need to focus on opening doors for those who are reentering society, instead of slamming them shut.” “We praise the Senate and House sponsors of the Second Chance Month resolution, which echoes the values shared by Prison Fellowship and the more than 800 churches and partners who believe that Americans with a criminal record can rise from their past, make amends, and reach their God-given potential,”\\xa0said Heather Rice-Minus, CEO and President of Prison Fellowship. “We support the passing of this resolution and the lawmakers who strive to remove unfair and unnecessary barriers to work, housing, education, and other fundamentals for citizens who have paid their debt to society so they can live lives of productivity and purpose.” Congressman David Trone was elected to the House of Representatives in November 2018 to serve the 6th District of Maryland, which includes all or part of Montgomery, Frederick, Washington, Allegany, and Garrett Counties.

       " \"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan (both R-Alaska) and Representative Mary Sattler Peltola (D-Alaska) today slammed President Biden and his administration for making two more major adversarial decisions—on top of dozens of others over the past three years—that will prevent responsible resource development in Alaska. Earlier today, the Department of the Interior (DOI) released a Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) for the Ambler Access Project (AAP), selecting the “no action” alternative to deny the project’s re-approval. Federal law provides for the AAP—which was previously approved in 2020—to provide access to the Ambler Mining District, state-owned lands with significant deposits of copper, cobalt, gallium, germanium, and other critical minerals that are crucial to the U.S. economy and national security. DOI also finalized its “Proposed Rule for Management and Protection of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska (NPR-A).” The final rule prohibits leasing and infrastructure development on millions of acres of the petroleum reserve and threatens access to millions more. This is again contrary to federal law, which requires an expeditious program of leasing and development.\\xa0 “The Biden administration may be focused on short-term political gains, but at the expense of Alaska’s long-term future, limiting jobs for Alaskans, revenues for our state, and the future energy and mineral security of our nation,” Senator Murkowski said. “Once again, the President and his team are making unjustifiable decisions that hurt us while allowing some of the worst regimes in the world—in nations like Iran and Russia—to stay in power, enrich themselves from resource production, and then use those revenues to finance terror and war. At this point, the Biden administration is undermining the rule of law, ignoring the voices of Alaska Natives, and punishing Alaska despite our strong environmental record. I will work with Dan and Mary to overturn these decisions any way we can—whether in Congress, the courts, or the next administration.” “The Biden administration sanctions Alaskans, while terrorists in Iran and communists in China get off scot-free and are strengthened. It's no wonder, with such anti-American policies, that authoritarian regimes in Russia, China and Iran are on the march,” said Senator Sullivan. “The Biden administration is deliberately undertaking policies to punish Americans and undermine our strengths while continuing to help our adversaries. Shutting down two of the world's most important energy and critical mineral developments in our country sends this message to the dictators in Iran, China and Russia: We won't use our resources to strengthen America, but we’ll become more dependent on yours. In their statements, both President Biden and Interior Secretary Haaland say they’re taking such actions after extensive consultation and to ‘[safeguard] the way of life’ for Alaska Natives. These statements are flat out lies. This decision goes against the strong opposition of the elected Alaska Native leaders from the North Slope Borough region—whose voices throughout this process have been canceled. In fact, the elected Indigenous leaders from the North Slope of Alaska have flown 4,000 miles to D.C. eight times, requesting a meeting with Interior Secretary Haaland to express their vehement opposition to the administration’s new NPR-A rule. Each time, they were denied a meeting. The truth of what’s going on here is that Joe Biden is listening to and taking direction from far-left Lower 48 eco-colonialists who don’t give a damn about the Indigenous people of the North Slope of Alaska and who Joe Biden believes he needs for his reelection. Like the dictators in Moscow, Tehran and Beijing, these eco-colonialists are overjoyed about this decision, while the Alaska Native people who’ve lived in the North Slope region for thousands of years are despondent, discouraged and deeply offended.” “Closing off NPR-A is a huge step back for Alaska, failing to strike a balance between the need for gap oil and natural gas and legitimate environmental concerns, and steamrolling the voices of many Alaska Natives in the decision-making process,” said Representative Peltola. “The Ambler Road decision is premature, as real conversations among stakeholders in the region are ongoing. Alaska has a wealth of natural resources that can be responsibly developed to help boost domestic manufacturing and innovation—in the end, it should be up to Alaskans to decide what they want developed in their regions.” Background: Ambler Access Project: The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) of 1980 guarantees a right-of-way (ROW) across federal lands to provide road access to the Ambler Mining District. Federal permitting for the AAP began in 2015—during the Obama administration—and included a rigorous environmental and economic analysis (EEA). After holding 18 public meetings and considering over 3,000 unique public comments, in July 2020, the Secretaries of the Interior and Transportation signed a joint Record of Decision (ROD) selecting the Northern Alignment as the approved route for the road. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the National Park Service later issued a 50-year ROW permit for the AAP. In February 2022, DOI sought a voluntary court remand to conduct an SEIS for the AAP. The very same day, President Biden held a roundtable on “Securing Critical Minerals for a Future Made in America”—failing to recognize the Ambler Mining District is one of the nation’s best options to produce them, but foreshadowing his administration’s incoherence on this issue. The court agreed to DOI’s narrow remand request in May 2022, but placed conditions on it to ensure it would move forward expeditiously. The Alaska Delegation has repeatedly urged DOI to re-approve the AAP, including through a letter sent in December 2023. As explained in that letter, the AAP would provide access known deposits of copper, cobalt, gallium, germanium, and other needed minerals. Alaska’s Petroleum Reserve: Congress set the NPR-A aside in 1923 for oil and gas development. In 1980, Congress amended the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act to direct the Secretary of the Interior to “conduct an expeditious program of competitive leasing” in the area. During the Obama-Biden administration, companies were encouraged to develop in the petroleum reserve, as opposed to other parts of Alaska. On September 8, 2023, DOI proposed to cut off access to millions of acres within the NPR-A, by suddenly and dramatically reinterpreting the law so that it can treat 13.1 million acres of Special Areas in the NPR-A as de facto federal wilderness. In October 2023, the Alaska Delegation requested an 80-day extension to the comment deadline for BLM’s proposed rule, citing DOI’s lack of meaningful consultation with communities and stakeholders on the North Slope. The Delegation sent another letter shortly thereafter, outlining deficiencies in the SEIS, and another in April 2024, again urging DOI to withdraw its misguided and unlawful rule. While taking dramatic steps to limit resource development in Alaska, the Biden administration has relaxed sanctions on Iran and Venezuela and failed to enforce an international price cap on Russian oil—allowing all three regimes to enrich themselves. The Indigenous elected leaders of Alaska’s North Slope published statements today expressing their outrage at the Biden administration’s decision to advance its September 2023 Proposed NPR-A Rule. # # #\",\n",

This funding will be used to purchase two light comparison microscopes and one 3D virtual comparison microscope for the laboratory Firearm Section. Klobuchar and Smith requested the funding along with U.S. Representative Dean Phillips (D-MN).  “Ensuring Hennepin County has access to the equipment and resources they need to keep Minnesotans safe is a top priority,” said Klobuchar. “We secured these federal grants so\\xa0 Hennepin County can purchase much-needed tools for the Sheriff’s forensic lab and make important upgrades to emergency shelters.”  “Improving public safety infrastructure is critical to ensuring the safety of our communities,” said Smith. “This new Emergency Shelter System and Forensic Science Lab will streamline and improve processes in Hennepin County, directly benefiting constituents.”  Klobuchar and Smith have successfully secured: Hennepin County will use the $750,000 to build a new emergency shelter that will better serve guests in a safer sleeping layout. The Sheriff’s Office will use the $450,000 to purchase two light comparison microscopes and one 3D virtual comparison microscope for the laboratory Firearm Section.  Klobuchar and Smith have been actively involved in securing this federal funding for projects benefiting communities across the state through a process called “Congressionally Directed Spending” (CDS).

As happened with Section 230, and what happened when they just acted like these companies were things in a garage, and now they\\'re humongous monopolies, and now we are all challenged and trying to get these bills forward. Whether it\\'s on fentanyl, whether it is on child pornography, whether it is on competition policy. We have to move these.\\xa0  The fake robocall. I hadn\\'t actually heard it myself, so thank you for that. And it is just impossible to tell that that\\'s not Joe Biden as it was impossible to tell one video that ran during the Republican primary that wasn\\'t accurate involving Donald Trump. That also wasn\\'t accurate. Or we had an Elizabeth Warren video in which she says “Republicans shouldn\\'t vote,” that wasn\\'t her, but you couldn\\'t tell. We had in Minnesota, and this is not AI, but it just shows how devastating this can be. We had a photo the day after the heroes, the two police officers in Burnsville, Minnesota, were killed after rescuing seven kids, and then the paramedic was killed who was performing CPR. A photo of an actual rally picture from 2022 that I was kind of in the background on started going around. At the same time, there\\'s some kind of Russian photo going around saying that I fund Nazis in Ukraine. That\\'s been going around for three years. This photo had a red circle around me in the background, and then they put “defund the police\" signs in the hands of the people at the rally that were never there. So they were literally using, the people who did this, I personally think it was foreign interests, took a photo and put those “defund the police” signs, after these officers have been killed. And to their credit, X and Meta, put “altered content” with the big sign, but it took us about, you know, a day to get all this down. It was going all around the internet. That is actually not AI. That\\'s a real photo that they doctored, and people thought it was real. It looked real. And so this kind of thing is just going to keep happening and keep happening unless we take immediate, immediate action.\\xa0  Eleven states, including my own, have enacted laws to address these threats to our elections, and that\\'s great, but it doesn\\'t cover federal. Some of these states are–they\\'re not all blue states, purple states, people are taking action as seen by the bipartisan nature of our legislation. And we also need disclaimers on other ads that aren\\'t deepfakes, and that\\'s a bill that we will also be marking up in the Rules Committee. So I want to thank my colleagues for doing this. I want to thank them for their willingness to stand up on this issue, and [I] look forward to hearing the testimony of the witnesses. Thank you.  …  Senator Klobuchar: Right now, I\\'m going to focus on elections, but I will say those were startling numbers, Mr. Colman, and I think it is just what we\\'re seeing both real people and AI-created people, it\\'s one of the reasons that we got the SHIELD Act through here, which is not the liability issue that I also support, that Senator Hawley was mentioning, but also getting the information to law enforcement and the like, to be able to make it easier to go after these perpetrators. And we can just sit here and do nothing, we can pass resolutions, but unless we empower people to go after these cases and then equally make liability, it\\'s just gonna get worse and worse, and at some point, the public will have had it. I don\\'t know if that\\'s what–this year–but it\\'s going to happen. And so, I keep telling my colleagues this. So let\\'s go to a few things here, the bill that I mentioned that Senator Hawley and Coons and Collins and Bennet, Ricketts, others [and] I have. Could you tell me, Mr. Colman, how AI has this potential to turbocharge election-related disinformation and why we can\\'t just rely on the disclaimers and watermarks? I think you can do that for a set of it. I don\\'t think you should do it for all uses of AI, and we have a labeling bill that I think differentiates that, but for this really bad stuff that Secretary of State Scanlon was referring to, tell us why it\\'s not enough. This is softball but to run the whole thing and have a little label underneath when they think it\\'s the actual candidate, but it\\'s not.\\xa0  Ben Colman: We agree on that. I think that to paint the larger picture, what we saw during the primaries was a single static deepfake, pre-recorded, kind of a one-to-many attack. It didn\\'t change. It wasn\\'t even live. Imagine a world where that was a one-to-one attack where instead of it being pre-recorded, it was actually live, and instead of being from one-to-many, it was one-to-one where it\\'s coming from your husband, your wife, your boss, saying “Hey, Ben, we need you in the office of 6 am, I know it\\'s a voting day” or to an election official “Hey, we\\'re moving your precinct, we need you to be across town three hours away.” And that\\'s where this is gonna go. It\\'s not going to be a single pre-recorded, you know, arguably medium-level deepfake. It\\'s going to be a real-time custom deepfake in conversational language. Have people do all kinds of things at all levels of the election system.\\xa0  So, on our side, we see this as a massive issue, not just in the U.S. but globally, and what\\'s great here is on the dais we have different technologies, all solving very much the same issue. It\\'s all possible now. We have large companies. We work with large banks, large government groups, large media organizations that are thinking long-term and already solving for this. We have banks scanning incoming phone calls, every single phone call. We don\\'t have anyone protecting average consumers, my parents, my grandparents, they just don\\'t stand a chance. With other technologies, whether it\\'s CSAM or, for example, a computer virus, they don\\'t have to be experts. They don\\'t have to tell ransomware or an APT, they just know that their email provider will actually block it for them.\\xa0  We\\'re looking for the bare minimum there, which is just letting us know that maybe something might be fake and then allowing us to decide maybe we don\\'t want to see it, maybe it won\\'t go viral. But right now, the things that are most extreme go the most viral, and platforms that do think about this are already solving that using technology like ours.  Klobuchar:\\xa0 Right. Very good. And I do want to note that drafting this bill, the deepfake bill wasn\\'t easy. We had to look at allowing satire, right? And all these kinds of things within the framework of the Constitution, and having Democratic and Republican lawyers look at this, to figure out what gave us a chance. I just think if the platform can point to something, as opposed to laws that aren\\'t quite on point, which eleven states have done for states, but not for federal and say, “we\\'ve got to take this down.” We\\'re going to be in a much better place than we are with a little label that they may not even notice. Also the labels, you know, I think it\\'s important for some of this, but I don\\'t think it can be the only answer. Mr. Scanlan, you know, birthplace of democracy, no kidding, I spent a little time in your state there. I know you cherish democracy very much. Could you talk about what other federal support will be helpful in taking this on in addition to stronger laws?  David Scanlan: Secretaries of State, for a good decade now, have been dealing with misinformation and disinformation generally, and that takes on many different forms. And there\\'s no question that today, voters receive their news in different formats than they did twenty years ago, and a lot of that news is electronic. It\\'s on your cell phone. Many voters believe exactly what they see on that tech, on that format, on that media without question. So, in addition to whatever might be appropriate to help states recognize and put brakes on malicious technology in terms of deepfakes, I think we have to spend a real strong effort on the fundamentals of transparency, and helping voters, and educating voters on the election systems, and how they run, and what the checks and balances are that are protecting them in the polling place.  Klobuchar: I\\'ve always found it interesting, like those Baltic states on the border with Russia, they were putting up misinformation, lying, things, and they, over time, because of education, they kind of have seen through some of it. It is possible, but it can’t be our only answer because of what everyone\\'s being exposed to, but I think it\\'s a good point, and we have the election assistant, of course, commission, but I did want to say appreciate as a Republican Secretary of State how seriously you and the Attorney General and others in New Hampshire took this egregious breach with the guy that did an interview afterward. Maybe they should have hired a mime instead of a magician. But in the end, I just think that we\\'ve got to make clear there\\'s consequences when this happens as well.\\xa0  I have other questions. I don\\'t want to go over my colleagues\\' time, I already have–I’ll ask you on the record, Mr. Ahmed and Mr. Gupta, thank you so much for being witnesses today. But I just..we have to be as sophisticated as the people that are messing around with our democracy and our laws, and that\\'s why we’ve got to get these bills done. Thank you.\\xa0  Klobuchar, Chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration with oversight over federal elections, has led efforts to address the threat of misleading AI-generated content and to increase transparency in our elections.  In September 2023, Klobuchar and Senators Josh Hawley (R-MO), Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law; Chris Coons (D-DE), Chair of the Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Intellectual Property; and Collins, introduced the Protect Elections from Deceptive AI Act, bipartisan legislation to ban the use of AI to generate materially deceptive content falsely depicting federal candidates to influence federal elections. This legislation has also been cosponsored by Senators Michael Bennet (D-CO) and Pete Ricketts (R-NE). Klobuchar also held a Senate Rules Committee hearing in September 2023 titled “AI and the Future of Elections,” highlighting the need to address the risks posed by AI to our democracy.  In March, Klobuchar and Senator Susan Collins (R-ME), Vice Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, introduced the bipartisan Preparing Election Administrators for AI Act to require the Election Assistance Commission (EAC), in consultation with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, to develop voluntary guidelines for election offices. These guidelines will address the use and risks of artificial intelligence (AI) in election administration, cybersecurity, information sharing about elections, and the spread of election-related disinformation.  In March, Klobuchar and Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) introduced the bipartisan AI Transparency in Elections Act to require disclaimers on political ads with images, audio, or video that are substantially generated by artificial intelligence (AI). The bill also requires the Federal Election Commission to address violations of the legislation quickly.  In February, the EAC voted unanimously to assist state and local election officials in combating the spread of AI-generated disinformation about our elections by allowing election officials to use federal election funds to counter disinformation in our elections caused by artificial intelligence. This decision came after Klobuchar and Collins’ letter calling on the EAC to take action to address AI-generated disinformation in elections following the fake AI-generated robocalls using the president’s voice to tell people not to vote in New Hampshire.    ### Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2024/4/at-senate-judiciary-subcommittee-hearing-klobuchar-urges-action-to-address-deepfakes-in-elections',\n",

That’s why I voted against H.Res.883. “This resolution is a cynical ploy by House Republicans to distract from the real issues facing our communities. It dangerously conflates a slogan with antisemitism, undermining genuine efforts to combat hatred. Even more concerning, this resolution accomplishes nothing to combat antisemitism. Instead, it’s a thinly-veiled attempt by House Republicans to deflect responsibility for their inaction on this urgent issue. “We cannot play politics with the safety of our communities, and the recent spike in antisemitism across the nation presents a grave threat that requires every single one of us to band together against all forms of hatred. We cannot play politics with the safety of our communities. We have a moral responsibility to protect them from hate and fear, and it’s shameful to trivialize the alarming rise in antisemitism. Throughout my career, I have tirelessly worked to fight against antisemitism and all forms of hate. H.Res.883 trivializes the alarming rise in antisemitism.

Chris Smith (R-Manchester) today introduced legislation (HR 8082) that would empower local residents impacted by proposed 5G projects and would rein in the power of telecommunication giants to fast track their rollout of 5G wireless, steamrolling community opposition in the process. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0Specifically, Smith’s bill would nullify two administrative regulations issued by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 2018 that unfairly advantage industry by imposing “shot clocks” and other tools that limit the input of town and county governments when it comes to the construction and proliferation of the significant infrastructure needed to advance 5G wireless. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0“My legislation will repeal these harmful regulations that have been exploited by providers to limit county and municipal governments—and blatantly disregard reasonable concerns of local citizens,” said Smith. “HR 8082 will restore the critical role that residents should play when considering the health, safety and aesthetic of their community,” said Smith.\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Smith’s legislation comes as the legal battle over Verizon’s aggressive push to install 20 5G towers in Belmar ramps up. Just last month, a group of Belmar residents joined Monmouth County in ongoing litigation regarding the 30-foot towers, citing concerns over the potential detrimental impact on the aesthetic quality of their neighborhood, the local environment and wildlife, and their property values. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0“The implementation of 5G can help our economy and telecommunications networks, but it cannot and should not be done at the expense of valued local input or under unreasonable time restraints,” said Smith. “There can and should be a balance between the concerns and needs of the local community and the desires of providers of utility and telecommunication services.” \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0In a letter to Verizon last year, Smith urged the telecommunications giant to heed the extensive concerns of the local community and rescind its plan to install 20 5G towers in Belmar. Smith penned the letter as Verizon’s push to install the 5G towers in Belmar entered a new phase with the telecommunications corporation turning its sights to the County of Monmouth—the lawful owner of the boardwalk property—after wrongfully suing the Borough of Belmar for access to the land. \\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0“American democracy is supposed to be about the consent of the governed,” said Smith.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0“Clearly, there is no consent here and we again implore Verizon to work with the correct authority—i.e. the County—to reexamine the substantial objections raised by members of the local community and respond with transparency and consideration for Belmar residents, Belmar’s tourism, and those of the other shore municipalities along the coast of NJ.”\\xa0  ### Chris has three offices dedicated to constituent services.

       " 'April 18, 2024 For Immediate Release Contact: Taylor Haulsee \\xa0 Speaker Johnson joined Newsmax to discuss the House’s national security supplemental \\xa0 WASHINGTON\\xa0—\\xa0This evening, Speaker Johnson joined “The Record” with Greta Van Susteren to discuss the difference in the House national security supplemental legislation and the Senate foreign aid package, and crucial border security measures. \\xa0  Click here to watch the full interview. \\xa0 On the House national security supplemental: \\xa0 What we did was we rejected the Senate supplemental bill because it was everything merged into one and it didn’t have some of these important features that we want in the bill. So, we redrafted it and we’re going to send them a House supplemental bill, it’s very different. For one thing, we broke it into four pieces. We have the Israel component, the Ukraine component, the Indo-Pacific component, and then we have a fourth bill that is in this package, that has a lot of our innovations included like the REPO Act, where we use the seized assets of corrupt Russian oligarchs to fund the opposition in Ukraine. \\xa0 Everybody thinks that makes sense. President Trump is credited with really advancing this idea of the loan concept to your point and so what we’ve done is we say any of the funding that goes to Ukraine for this governmental assistance is in the form of a loan that’s in our package that are the House will be voting on early Saturday. \\xa0 The rule has been finished up tonight to make that possible. We’ve also included a lot of other things like increasing sanctions against Iran and Russia. We’re going to change the strategy and have a lot more oversight and accountability over the funds because that’s what the American people deserve. But as I’ve said so many times in the last 24 hours, you know, I’d rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys, we don’t want to have boots on the ground, and we can prevent that by allowing them to hold Putin at bay. \\xa0 On oversight of humanitarian aid:  \\xa0 We’ve required in the House’s version of this strict accountability. The White House has to give reports of the funds and we ban any of that funding from going to UNRWA to, you know, any of the UN agencies that are involved with any of the terrorist organizations. These are really, really important things. This is the precious treasure of the American people. \\xa0 On border security: \\xa0 The border is the number one priority of the House Republicans, we fight for it here every single day. I’ve been doing it since I became Speaker and way before. Since Joe Biden entered the Oval Office, he’s created an absolute catastrophe at the border. And you and I don’t need to recount all the statistics and the parade of horrible that has come out of that we must fix it. \\xa0 The American people demand it and we fight every day. I’ve been trying to push the president to use his executive authority to close that border and he refuses to do it. We passed HR 2, our signature legislation, the Secure the Border Act. It would fix every one of these problems. It’s been sitting on Chuck Schumer’s desk for over a year. We have continued to work every single day we’ve passed resolution. \\xa0 \\xa0 ### \\n\\nTags: \\n Tweet\\n Share\\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tH-232, The Capitol\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWashington, D.C. 20515\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t202-225-4000\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t ©2024 U.S. House of Representatives.

Mr. Johnson deserves credit for his show of conviction, which represents the best of the GOP in the tradition of Ronald Reagan. \\xa0 “This is a critical time right now, a critical time on the world stage,” Mr. Johnson told reporters on Wednesday. “I think providing lethal aid to Ukraine right now is critically important. I really do. I really do believe the intel and the briefings that we’ve gotten. I believe Xi [Jinping] and Vladimir Putin and Iran really are an axis of evil. I think they’re in coordination on this. I think that Vladimir Putin would continue to march through Europe if he were allowed.” \\xa0 And “to put it bluntly,” Mr. Johnson added, “I would rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys. My son is going to begin in the Naval Academy this fall. This is a live-fire exercise for me, as it is so many American families.” \\xa0 He is correct about the global nature of the threat. American weakness in Europe increases the odds that U.S. troops will eventually be forced into a fight, either on that continent or elsewhere in the world. \\xa0 One certainty is that you won’t hear Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene address these substantive points. The Republican malcontents are shouting about supposed betrayal and that Mr. Johnson should focus on the crisis at the southern border. \\xa0 But they know he’d pass border measures in a heartbeat if he had the votes in the House. The options now are to consign Ukraine to defeat or try to hold the line against Mr. Putin, and the latter is still possible even after months of Washington dithering. \\xa0 “I’m going to allow an opportunity for every single member of the House to vote their conscience and their will on this,” Mr. Johnson noted. “I think that’s the way this institution is supposed to work,” and the irony is that the House’s rump right flank would agree if he were moving a measure they favor. \\xa0 “And I’m willing to take personal risk for that,” he said. That risk includes putting his Speakership on the line amid threats from Ms. Greene and Rep. Thomas Massie to try to topple him if he holds votes on these bills. If they do attempt this, we’ll see if Democrats are willing to put country before partisanship and vote down the coup. \\xa0 Mr. Johnson’s behavior is called leadership, and the GOP would be more popular and better able to govern if more of its members showed such mettle themselves—or had more respect for those who demonstrate it. \\xa0 Appeared in the April 19, 2024, print edition as ‘Mike Johnson Makes His Case on Ukraine’. \\xa0 ### \\n\\nTags: \\n Tweet\\n Share\\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tH-232, The Capitol\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWashington, D.C. 20515\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t202-225-4000\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t ©2024 U.S. House of Representatives.

       " \"CQ Roll Call April 15, 2024  California Democrat\\xa0Nanette Barragán, chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and other Congressional Tri-Caucus leaders are\\xa0calling for the restoration\\xa0of the House Office of Diversity and Inclusion after its funding was slashed.\\xa0 Republican appropriators zeroed out $3.5 million for the diversity office in the fiscal 2024 package enacted in March (PL 118-47). Barragán joined Congressional Black Caucus Chair\\xa0Steven Horsford, D-Nev., and Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus Chair\\xa0Judy Chu, D-Calif., in an April 8 letter to Democratic leaders calling for restoration of funding in the future.\\xa0 “Republican lawmakers are so eager to score political points by eliminating all diversity and inclusion programs that they undercut a non-partisan office that dozens of their own Members have used to identify highly qualified candidates that they went on to hire,” the group wrote. House Republicans have been critical of the office, claiming it had become partisan. Getting to Congress:\\xa0Barragán took her first steps into politics with a role in the White House’s Office of Public Liaison under the Clinton administration. She worked as a lawyer before winning a seat on the Hermosa Beach City Council. Barragán served on the city council for two years, including a short stint as mayor, before throwing her hat in the race to replace Democratic Rep. Janice Hahn, who left Congress in 2016. Barragán pulled off an upset victory against Democratic State Sen. Isadore Hall, the California Democratic Party’s preferred candidate.\\xa0 Her District:\\xa0The 44th District is an urban district encompassing parts of Los Angeles and Long Beach in Southern California. A major economic driver is the Port of Los Angeles. The port has ranked as the busiest container shipping port in the Western hemisphere since 2000 and is a key connection for trade with Asia, according to statistics released by port officials. Nearly $300 billion worth of cargo passed through the port in 2023. The predominantly Hispanic district is a Democratic stronghold, and Barragán won her last election with over 72 percent of the vote. What’s New:\\xa0Barragán criticized Democrats in February for excluding members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus from negotiations over border provisions included in an initial version of a foreign aid package (HR 815). “Imagine a civil rights or criminal justice bill negotiated without the Congressional Black Caucus at the table,” Barragán said in a Feb. 5 statement. That proposal stalled in the Senate after a majority of Republicans swiftly came out against the border agreement, despite having insisted for months that they would only support additional aid for Ukraine if it was accompanied with tighter border security provisions. The following week, the Senate passed a $95.3 billion security supplemental without the border deal. Point of Interest:\\xa0Since coming to Washington, Barragán has been a regular participant in the Congressional Women’s Softball Game, an annual charity match between lawmakers and members of the press. Barragán, who also plays in other congressional sporting events, made her high school baseball team, but ultimately joined the softball team instead after receiving flak from boys. “And the guys weren’t very good,” she said.

       " \"It is widely known that Iran is the largest state sponsor of terror on earth. Through its proxies like Hamas and Hezbollah, it funds dozens of attacks on Israel and other U.S. allies every year. Over the weekend, Iran launched a direct attack on Israel by firing hundreds of missiles and drones with the goal of indiscriminately killing as many Israelis as possible. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which is essentially the Iranian government and a terrorist group itself, claims these acts where somehow an act of defense. If it weren’t so serious and dangerous, that claim would be laughable. The IRGC has been attacking Israel for decades and was the primary sponsor and supporter of Hamas’ terrorist attack on October 7th.  We’ve talked a lot about sanctions over the last weeks, months, and even years. As I’m writing this, the White House is promising new, hard-hitting sanctions on Iran. But sanctions aren’t new. We’ve actually been sanctioning Iran since the late 1970s. So, it begs the question: how is Iran funding all of these attacks, continuing to build its nuclear capabilities, and growing the wealth of the people at the very top of its government? Like Russia, Iran is quite skilled at getting around U.S. and European sanctions. They do this in many ways including utilizing shell companies to launder money and stealing humanitarian aid from their own people. While thinking about how Iran and Russia evade sanctions, it also raises the question: how did we get to a point where we’re talking about more sanctions in response to some of the worst people on the planet so cavalierly attacking humanity? That question is easier to answer. The Biden Administration’s refusal to lead has emboldened our adversaries. The 2021 withdraw from Afghanistan – often touted as an achievement by Biden and his Cabinet – not only killed 13 U.S. service members, but it also gave the green light to terrorist organizations in the Middle East to take over and wreak havoc. Because bad news spreads fast, other nefarious actors, like Putin, followed suit. In February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine in an attempt to rebuild the Soviet Union. On October 7th, 2023, Hamas claimed over 1,200 lives, 32 of which were American, in the brutal attack against Israel. Every day, the Chinese Communist Party persistently spies on American citizens and infiltrates our economy, all while edging closer to waging war against Taiwan.\\xa0 These places, dates and events don’t even scratch the surface of the impact war, let alone terrorism has on a nation and its economy, people and longevity. We can’t stop every bad person from doing bad things. Maniacs like Putin and IRGC leader Hossein Salami will always be evil. But we can make it more difficult for Iran to achieve their goals. This week the House passed several bills to directly combat Iran’s ability to fund terrorism. One of them was my bill, the Iran Sanctions Accountability Act. For decades, our sanctions have allowed for humanitarian aid for ordinary civilians. Because of that, it is our duty to ensure aid is reaching the intended recipients. My bill forces the Administration to put certain mechanisms in place to ensure humanitarian aid cannot be stolen from the Iranian people and diverted to other parts of Iran's budget to be spent on bombs, missiles, and drone attacks. In passing The Iran Sanctions Accountability Act, Congress is ensuring any future humanitarian aid to Iran undergoes rigorous due diligence. I stand by my decision to support Israel and always have. As a nation, Israel has a fundamental right to defend themselves and deserves support from their allies whether it be via the Iron Dome –which numerous House Democrats tried to defund – or through backing them in their fight against terrorists invading their soil. The world has exploited the Administration’s weakness for over three years now. It’s time to draw a line in the sand and, if crossed, respond with the full force of the most powerful nation on earth.

       " 'Last weekend, I hosted my annual Service Academy Day at the New River Community College in Dublin. \\xa0 I enjoy these events as they provide great opportunities for high school students, parents and educators to learn about Service Academies, Army Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC), and other programs. \\xa0 I take pride in allowing students in Southwest Virginia to have access to opportunities to admirably pursue a career in military service. \\xa0 The Ninth District is home to many patriotic men and women, and we also have a rich tradition of service. \\xa0 A major piece of our history involves the D-Day invasion of Normandy during World War II. When Company A stormed Omaha Beach on June 6, 1944, there were 35 soldiers from Bedford. By the end of the campaign, 23 would be dead, making Bedford, Virginia, the town with the highest per capita deaths. \\xa0 Bedford commemorates this sacrifice by true Virginia heroes with its National D-Day Memorial.  \\xa0 Bedford is Virginia’s only WWII Heritage City. \\xa0 I am honored that it is in the Ninth District. \\xa0 Given our rich heritage, I host Service Academy Days to tap into the patriotic spirit of our youth. Families and children travel from across the Ninth District to attend and get more information. Some even attend from other states. \\xa0 Invited guests typically include representatives from the U.S. Military Academy, U.S. Naval Academy, U.S. Air Force Academy, U.S. Coast Guard Academy, U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, Virginia Military Institute, Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets, Virginia Tech ROTC, and Emory & Henry ROTC. \\xa0 The representatives from these programs consist of current and former cadets, admissions officers and ROTC directors and students who actively engage with interested individuals and discuss their options for a college military experience. \\xa0 As a Congressman, I am permitted to fill five vacancies over a four-year period at each Academy, with the exception of U.S. Merchant Marine. \\xa0 While U.S. Merchant Marine is not a popular selection for many in Southwest Virginia, I can fill ten vacancies each year there. \\xa0 Once the U.S. Merchant Marine program is completed, the participant becomes eligible for commission into any branch of the U.S. military, provided that they are in good standing.  \\xa0 ROTC programs are another option. They are great at providing leadership and physical training exercises for students while they continue their academic studies at their university or college. \\xa0 Some historians trace the roots of ROTC programs to the Morrill Act of 1862, also known as the Land Grant Act of 1862. This was signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln. \\xa0 At the time, there was a stark decline in the numbers of trained engineers present in American colleges and universities.  \\xa0 The Land Grant Act laid the groundwork for a national system of state universities. The bill granted 30,000 acres of public land to each state for the establishment of institutions of scientific learning. The land grant institutions reciprocated by offering military tactics courses.  \\xa0 Virginia Tech maintains a strong record in this space. Their campus features a War Memorial Court, dedicated to the eight VT alumni who are medal of honor recipients. Close to the War Memorial Chapel is a marble cenotaph with their names etched into it. \\xa0 VT sponsors a ROTC program, as well as VT Corps of Cadets. \\xa0 The mission of the VT Corps of Cadets program is to nurture and create great leaders. The four-year program draws upon exercises that target teamwork, character and problem-solving skills. This is designed to develop leadership qualities among our brave servicemen and women and shape future leaders within our military. \\xa0 The VT Corps of Cadets prides itself in giving back to the community. In the 2022-2023 academic school year, cadets collected over 2,000 hours of community service. \\xa0 \\xa0 I was proud to hear that my alma mater, Emory & Henry College, relaunched their own Army ROTC program in 2018 after nearly a century.  \\xa0 As of 2018, Emory & Henry became one of only five private institutions in Virginia to offer an ROTC program.\\xa0  \\xa0 Another Virginia private institution that comes to my event is VMI. \\xa0 VMI has an extensive recruitment network. VMI excels in showcasing their opportunities and highlighting their illustrious history of producing exceptional military talents, the likes of whom include former U.S. Secretary of Defense, George C. Marshall, Jr. \\xa0 If you or someone you know is interested in applying to attend one of our academies, please contact Josh Hess at josh.hess@mail.house.gov or (540) 381-5671. \\xa0 If you have questions, concerns, or comments, feel free to contact my office.\\xa0 You can call my Abingdon office at 276-525-1405 or my Christiansburg office at 540-381-5671.\\xa0 To reach my office via email, please visit my website at https://morgangriffith.house.gov.\\xa0 Also on my website is the latest material from my office, including information on votes recently taken on the floor of the House of Representatives. \\xa0 ### Enter your email address to get the latest updates straight to your inbox.

       " 'April 18, 2024 For Immediate Release Contact: Taylor Haulsee Speaker Johnson joined Newsmax to discuss the House’s national security supplemental \\xa0 WASHINGTON\\xa0—\\xa0This evening, Speaker Johnson joined “The Record” with Greta Van Susteren to discuss the difference in the House national security supplemental legislation and the Senate foreign aid package, and crucial border security measures. \\xa0 \\xa0 Click here to watch the full interview. \\xa0 On the House national security supplemental: \\xa0 What we did was we rejected the Senate supplemental bill because it was everything merged into one and it didn’t have some of these important features that we want in the bill. So, we redrafted it and we’re going to send them a House supplemental bill, it’s very different. For one thing, we broke it into four pieces. We have the Israel component, the Ukraine component, the Indo-Pacific component, and then we have a fourth bill that is in this package, that has a lot of our innovations included like the REPO Act, where we use the seized assets of corrupt Russian oligarchs to fund the opposition in Ukraine. \\xa0 Everybody thinks that makes sense. President Trump is credited with really advancing this idea of the loan concept to your point and so what we’ve done is we say any of the funding that goes to Ukraine for this governmental assistance is in the form of a loan that’s in our package that are the House will be voting on early Saturday. \\xa0 The rule has been finished up tonight to make that possible. We’ve also included a lot of other things like increasing sanctions against Iran and Russia. We’re going to change the strategy and have a lot more oversight and accountability over the funds because that’s what the American people deserve. But as I’ve said so many times in the last 24 hours, you know, I’d rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys, we don’t want to have boots on the ground, and we can prevent that by allowing them to hold Putin at bay. \\xa0 On oversight of humanitarian aid:  \\xa0 We’ve required in the House’s version of this strict accountability. The White House has to give reports of the funds and we ban any of that funding from going to UNRWA to, you know, any of the UN agencies that are involved with any of the terrorist organizations. These are really, really important things. This is the precious treasure of the American people. \\xa0 On border security: \\xa0 The border is the number one priority of the House Republicans, we fight for it here every single day. I’ve been doing it since I became Speaker and way before. Since Joe Biden entered the Oval Office, he’s created an absolute catastrophe at the border. And you and I don’t need to recount all the statistics and the parade of horrible that has come out of that we must fix it. \\xa0 The American people demand it and we fight every day. I’ve been trying to push the president to use his executive authority to close that border and he refuses to do it. We passed HR 2, our signature legislation, the Secure the Border Act. It would fix every one of these problems. It’s been sitting on Chuck Schumer’s desk for over a year. We have continued to work every single day we’ve passed resolution. \\xa0 \\xa0 ### \\n\\nTags: \\n Tweet\\n Share\\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tH-232, The Capitol\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWashington, D.C. 20515\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t202-225-4000\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t ©2024 U.S. House of Representatives.

       " 'For Immediate Release Contact: Taylor Haulsee \\xa0 Speaker Johnson joined the Mark Levin Show to make the case for the House version of the national security supplemental legislation \\xa0 WASHINGTON\\xa0—\\xa0Last night, Speaker Johnson joined the Mark Levin Show to make his case for the House version of the national security supplemental legislation.  Click here to listen to the full interview \\xa0 On the House improvements to supplemental national security legislation: \\xa0 Remember that the Senate sent to the House the supplemental foreign aid package, two months ago, right. What we’re doing right now, the House is not passing the Senate supplemental bill, we’re trying to fix that with some better policy and a better process. \\xa0 We took that that bill that had lumped Israel aid, Ukraine and the Indo-Pacific together, and we broke it into separate pieces so that in the House, everyone can vote up or down on their merits, each one of those items, and then we added a fourth bill to it… which is kind of a supplemental, and it has some of our policies and some of our preferences in there, where we make it tougher on Iran and Russia and China with sanctions. \\xa0 And we add the REPO Act, which is a seizure and transfer of about $5 billion in Russian sovereign assets in the US to help Ukraine efforts. Some of the other innovations are things that we all believe that the loan concept, you know, that’s something that President Trump has championed. We added that into this so that the Ukrainian funding that goes to support anything related to the government is a loan instead of a gift. \\xa0 And we added an amendment process so that the members of the House can vote their will, add things, and subtract things. So that’s what’s happening. It’ll be on the floor on Saturday here in the House, and everybody will get to vote their preferences on that, and I hope at the end, we can take care of our responsibilities. \\xa0 On the need for standalone bills: \\xa0 The whole process – the way it’s supposed to work in the House, is single subject distinct issues that we argue and debate and address on their own merits. And that’s what we’ve done here. The Senate likes to lump everything together in these giant omnibus bills. And we don’t believe in that. So, we’re getting back to that regular order, that regular process, and there’ll be lots of thoughtful discussion about it. And you know, I’ve encouraged every one of my colleagues Mark, we’re going to vote on this, get the confidential classified briefings on these things, get the real information, fully armed and equipped when you make such a consequential decision. \\xa0 On the need to fund Israel’s fight against Hamas:  \\xa0 We have funded Israel as you know, it was within 24 hours of my becoming Speaker back in October, we funded Israel we sent it over with a pay-for. We took the 14 billion out of the IRS, slush fund and then made Israel a priority. Instead, Chuck Schumer ignored it. About a month ago Mark I tried again, I sent them a plain, clean, we call it clean, Israel funding bill, put that on the floor to vote on no pay for it. Send it over. Let’s just take care of Israel and be off the table. 166 House Democrats voted against it. You know why? Because President Biden issued a veto threat a veto threat for a clean Israel funding bill… The Senate Democrats won’t give Israel the funding Mark. The only way that I can you and I and the American people can ensure that Israel gets the help it needs in this desperate hour is to attach it in this foreign supplemental package so that Joe Biden is forced, forced to send the support to Israel. \\xa0 On House Republicans 1-seat majority: \\xa0 With regards to a shutdown, they stop paying our troops who are in harm’s way, and they don’t pay TSA agents and everybody across the country starts getting their flights canceled and oh, don’t worry, they won’t be paying the border patrol agents either. So that blame would be shifted to us for not paying them you know, imagine that narrative. Well, guess what? To reopen the government, remembering the numbers, remember, I can only lose one Republican. I’ll have a big group of Republicans who won’t go along with it. It won’t be pure enough for them, whatever the thing is, they won’t reopen it. Which means you’ll have to have Democrats – imagine the deal that we’d have to cut. How much of a pound of flesh to give that we would have to give to get out of that mess. That’s an impossible situation. \\xa0 On Speaker Johnson’s conservative record: \\xa0 My entire life, I was in the trenches for the conservative movement. I was a constitutional law attorney like you, and I used to litigate cases to defend our fundamental freedoms in the courts. I did that for 20 years before going into politics. I came into Congress as a constitutional conservative, and I’ve defended those principles that led here and it’s the reason I wound up as Speaker of the House. I mean, I helped President Trump in his impeachment defenses twice. I mean, I’ve done the heavy lifting heavy load here now. We find ourselves in this unprecedented moment in history. It’s a fateful moment in history. And I come out with our core conservative principles and I’m here to advance those as far as I can up the day up the field every single day, inch by inch. \\xa0 My colleagues here, some of them here, want me to throw a Hail Mary pass on every play Mark. That’s not possible. That’s not a game plan. It’s three yards and a cloud of dust as we used to say when we play football, you got to go inch by inch up the field and get the first down to stay in the game. If we do that, we’re going to win in November. Donald Trump is going to be elected president again. We are going to win a Republican majority in the Senate, and we’re going to keep and grow the majority in the House. And when we have control, totally different ballgame. We can start throwing Hail Mary passes again, we can do those big plays and transformational change and by golly, we’re going to do it. Weve got an aggressive 100 days agenda that we’ll run and fix all this mess. \\xa0 I told Donald Trump himself a couple days ago: Mr. President, I’m going to state the obvious, in your next term, you could be the most consequential president of a modern era because everything is a disaster, and you can fix it. We run a policy agenda based on our core conservative principles. We will do the greatest service to this country that the history will record, but we got to get there. So, it’s fun to be taking arrows for the reality that we have with the numbers right now? No, but I’m going to do my job and I’m going to stay dug in and I’m not changing who I am or what I believe and I’m going to try to guide this institution. \\xa0 ### \\n\\n\\nTags: \\n Tweet\\n Share\\n\\n \\n\\nTags: \\n Tweet\\n Share\\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tH-232, The Capitol\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWashington, D.C. 20515\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t202-225-4000\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t ©2024 U.S. House of Representatives.

       " 'Washington, DC – Today, Congresswoman Julia Brownley (D-CA) joined Congressman Mike Ezell (R-MS) in introducing a resolution marking the 82nd anniversary of the establishment of the United States Naval Construction Force, more commonly known as the “Seabees.” The resolution recognizes the tremendous sacrifices and contributions of the Seabees, who have fought and served on behalf of our country. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Senator Roger Wicker (R-MS) introduced the companion legislation in the United States Senate.\\xa0\\xa0 “On the 82nd anniversary of the founding of the Navy Seabees, we acknowledge the thousands of service members – past and present – who have bravely defended our shores in every conflict since World War II. With a ‘Can Do’ motto, the Seabees carry out a mission to build bases, roadways, airstrips, and other essential infrastructure necessary for our military at home and around the world,” said Congresswoman Brownley. “As the proud representative of Naval Base Ventura County and home of the Pacific Seabees, I am honored to recognize and pay tribute to these remarkable sailors and their distinguished service to our country.” “For more than eight decades, the Seabees have served with honor, ingenuity, and a “Can Do” attitude,” said Congressman Ezell. “I am proud to have the Atlantic fleet Seabees call South Mississippi home, and I am incredibly grateful for their contributions to our nation and to our coastal communities.” “The remarkable history of the Seabees began right here in Rhode Island,” said Senator Whitehouse. “This resolution highlights the many contributions of the industrious Seabees in service to our country, and recognizes the role the Ocean State has played along the way.” “The Seabees are an integral part of Mississippi’s military history and Gulfport’s community. They have often put themselves into dire situations, whether assisting with natural disaster recovery or humanitarian missions across the globe. Our country and world are better off because of them,” said Senator Wicker. The resolution is also cosponsored by Representatives Seth Magaziner (D-RI), Gabe Amo (D-RI), Michael Guest (R-MS), Trent Kelly (R-MS), Nick Lalota (R-NY), Carlos A. Giménez (R-FL), Jill Tokuda (D-HI), Salud Carbajal (D-CA), Barbara Lee (D-CA), Mark Takano (D-CA), John Rutherford (R-FL), Adam Schiff (D-CA), and Bennie Thompson (D-MS), as well as Senators Jack Reed (D-RI) and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS).

WASHINGTON, D.C. –\\xa0Today, Representative Kathy Castor (FL-14) and U.S. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (NV)\\xa0introduced\\xa0bicameral\\xa0legislation to make it easier for new energy projects to connect to the U.S. electricity grid – in an effort\\xa0to improve\\xa0grid reliability and lower energy costs for families. “Across the United States, new energy projects are stalled, waiting in long lines to interconnect to the grid,”\\xa0said Rep. Castor. “Our bill would make commonsense reforms to the outdated, sluggish interconnection process and enable new energy generation to come online, faster. More energy generation on the grid means lower prices for consumers and more reliability throughout the electricity system.”\\xa0 “There are new energy projects being developed all over the country and we need to make sure they can get online as quickly as possible,”\\xa0said Senator Cortez Masto. “By speeding up the slow and outdated process of connecting new projects to the grid, my bicameral legislation will lower energy costs for Nevada families and make our grids more reliable.” \"The ongoing transformation of our energy landscape, characterized by the rapid retirement of power plants, the emergence of new technologies, the electrification of various sectors, a resurgence in load growth unseen for decades, and increasingly frequent extreme weather events, underscores consumers\\' undeniable concerns regarding reliable and affordable electricity services,” said\\xa0Karen Onaran, President and CEO of Electricity Consumers Resource Council. “It is essential that we rapidly connect replacement resources to an upgraded and modern electricity grid. The\\xa0Expediting Generator Interconnection Procedures Act (EGIPA)\\xa0proposes measures to further expedite and standardize the generator interconnection process, aiming for efficient and cost-effective solutions.\" “Reducing barriers to all power plant development is a commonsense bipartisan imperative,”\\xa0said Devin Hartman of R Street Institute.\\xa0“These barriers threaten grid reliability in an era of resurgent growth in demand. Fortunately, the\\xa0Expediting Generator Interconnection Procedures Act (EGIPA)\\xa0would ensure FERC finishes the job. It would bolster grid reliability, lower energy costs, and improve environmental outcomes by reducing regulatory impediments and facilitating freer markets. EGIPA is simply sound public policy.” The process of connecting new power plants to the national power grid – called interconnection – is complicated, expensive, and can take years to complete. According to the\\xa0U.S. Department of Energy, the “high volume of projects and inadequate existing procedures for interconnection has led to uncertainties, delays, inequities, and added costs for developers, consumers, utilities, and their regulators.”\\xa0a\\xa0recent study\\xa0from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory finds that interconnection backlog is only getting worse. Rep. Castor’s\\xa0Expediting Generator Interconnection Procedures Act (EGIPA)\\xa0would require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to make low-hanging fruit reforms to the interconnection process, making it faster and easier to complete. For example, the bill would promote the use of automation and standardized study criteria to help expedite interconnection studies.\\xa0 Ultimately, this legislation aims to improve grid reliability and lower prices for consumers by making more energy options available. It should be a key element of any\\xa0permitting reform\\xa0package that Congress moves forward with this year.\\xa0 EGIPA\\xa0is supported by a diverse group of 20 different organizations, including energy consumer advocacy groups like Electricity Consumers Resource Council (ELCON), Electricity Customer Alliance, and Industrial Energy Consumers of America (IECA).',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON- Today, Congressman David Scott (GA-13), Ranking Member of the House Agriculture Committee, sent a letter urging Governor Brian Kemp to take executive action to curb the production and possession of un-serialized and untraceable weapons commonly known as “ghost guns.” “Our communities are facing a scourge of violence because of homemade weapons that can be purchased and manufactured using the internet,” said Congressman David Scott. “Georgia’s lack of state statutes against these guns has caused them to permeate the streets, wreaking havoc in our communities. That is why I am calling on Governor Kemp to uphold his responsibility as our state’s chief law enforcement officer and use his authority to regulate ‘ghost guns’ and save lives.”\\xa0 Ghost guns are often purchased online through pre-made gun kits complete with instructions. Once assembled, these firearms do not contain serial numbers, making them untraceable and especially dangerous in the hands of criminal actors. Also of concern is 3-D printed gun parts which can increase the fire rate and lethality of previously unmodified weapons. The accessibility and untraceable nature of ghost guns is highly concerning, as they remove barriers for individuals who would otherwise be denied access to firearms. The letter has been endorsed by BlackPush, an Atlanta-based advocacy group dedicated to preventing gun violence and ending social injustice. \"With the rocketing rates of gun violence facing our nation, we must do more to limit access to guns by those seeking to do harm,” said BlackPush President and Founder Shaun Smith. “In Georgia, recent tragedies have underscored the negative impact that guns can have on our society and our communities while shattering the lives of those impacted. We echo Congressman Scott’s call to regulate ‘ghost guns’ and we further call on the State of Georgia to look at passing red flag laws, expanding background checks, and investing in mental health treatment.\" The text of the letter can be found HERE.

       " 'April 18, 2024 Letter to Ways and Means Committee Emphasizes Support for HOPE/HELP Text of Letter (PDF) WASHINGTON\\xa0– Haiti Caucus Co-Chairs Congresswomen Ayanna Pressley (MA-07), Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick (D-FL), and Yvette D. Clarke (D-NY) led a letter to House Ways and Means Committee leadership emphasizing support for the early renewal of the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement (HOPE) and the Haiti Economic Lift Program (HELP) Acts, commonly known as HOPE/HELP. The HOPE/HELP program allows duty-free access for certain apparel and textile products from Haiti to the U.S. market. “Now more than ever is the time to help stabilize Haiti and save lives – that includes supporting its economic growth and critical trade sectors,” said Congresswoman Pressley. “The Haitian people have suffered deeply and to allow HOPE/HELP to expire would be a drastic disservice to their livelihood. I am proud to join my fellow co-chairs in calling for the reauthorization of these vital programs and preserving our longstanding trade partnership with our Haitian neighbors.” “HOPE/HELP plays a critical role in driving economic expansion in Haiti’s garment industry and fostering employment in the country,” said Congresswoman Cherfilus-McCormick. “In these uncertain times for Haiti, it is imperative that we uphold and continue this vital program to ensure Haiti’s continued economic progress and stability.” “With the ongoing security crisis confronting Haiti, it is critical Haiti’s economy has the support needed to endure this challenging period in its history. Make no mistake – the swift renewal of HOPE/HELP is essential for Haiti’s post-crisis recovery and the future of its communities,” said Congresswoman Clarke. “Allowing Haiti’s apparel industry to lose necessary support in this moment of uncertainty would only serve to pull the rug out from under Haiti’s economy and instill further hardship on a nation that has already suffered dearly. Haiti and its people remain cherished allies of the United States, and that is why I am proud to stand with my fellow Co-Chairs of the Haiti Caucus to call for the continued funding of these vital programs.” HOPE/HELP is due to expire in September 2025, a little over a year from now.\\xa0 As a result of these programs, apparel exports have grown to over $1 billion, representing over 80% of Haiti’s total exports. While the security crisis has justifiably received the most attention, the House Haiti Caucus recognizes the essential importance of maintaining Haiti’s formal economy.\\xa0 Immediate reauthorization of HOPE/HELP ranks as one of the top policy priorities that the United States can do to help Haiti at this moment in time.\\xa0 Additional signatories of the letter include Reps. Alma Adams (D-NC), Mario Diaz-Balart (R-FL), Gerald Connolly (D-VA), Adriano Espaillat (D-NY), Maxwell Alejandro Frost (D-FL), Dan Goldman (D-NY), Jonathan Jackson (D-IL), Sydney Kamlager-Dove (D-CA), Barbara Lee (D-CA), Michael Lawler (R-NY), Andre Carson (D-IN). A copy of the letter text can be found here. As Representative for the Massachusetts 7th\\xa0Congressional District, Congresswoman Pressley serves as Co-Chair for the House Haiti Caucus and represents one of the largest Haitian diaspora communities in the country, with approximately 46,000 Haitians and Haitian-Americans living across the state and over half in the Boston metropolitan area.

       " 'This month, I introduced new legislation to increase opportunities for minority entrepreneurs to own broadcast stations in our communities. The Broadcast Varied Ownership Incentives for Community Expanded Service, or Broadcast VOICES Act, restores a program once proven effective and is very much needed today. The legislation will increase diversity among owners in the broadcasting industry by restoring mechanisms that encourage investment in broadcast stations owned by minorities and women. And I’m pleased to have Senator Gary Peters from Michigan introduce a Senate version of the bill. Our media landscape must reflect the diversity of the communities they serve. The Broadcast VOICES Act will re-open doors that have been shut for too long, giving more women and people of color in Nevada and around the country the chance to lead. I’m proud of our work empowering underrepresented voices to tell their stories and shape our local and national discourse. The Nevada Broadcasters Association supports the Broadcast VOICES Act. Their President and CEO, Mitch Fox, stated, “We believe this bill will encourage broadcast ownership diversity.” The Broadcast VOICES Act would reinstate the Minority Tax Certificate Program, significantly increasing minority ownership in broadcast media from 1978 to 1995. The program enabled the issuance of 287 radio and 40 television station certificates, increasing minority and women-owned station ownership by over 550%. Despite its success, the program was repealed in 1995. As of 2021, less than 6% of commercial broadcast television stations were owned by women and less than 4% are minority-owned. Under this legislation, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) would once again issue these tax certificates to facilitate sales of broadcast stations to socially disadvantaged individuals. It would also mandate annual FCC reports to Congress to recommend further ways to enhance ownership diversity. Additionally, the act introduces a new tax credit for current broadcast owners who donate their stations to train individuals new to managing and operating broadcast stations.

Kathy Castor (FL-14) released the below statement on Governor Ron DeSantis violating the law and disenrolling 22,576 Florida children from KidCare: “Governor DeSantis is throwing Florida kids off of the children’s health care program (“CHIP” or “Kidcare” in Florida)\\xa0and erecting barriers that keep kids from the doctor’s office in violation of federal law. On January 1, 2024, a new federal protection for children went into effect nationwide: continuous eligibility for Medicaid and CHIP coverage for children for 12 months. This means that once children are determined eligible for Medicaid or CHIP anywhere across the nation, they keep their health coverage for an entire year. It is a vital reform that is being celebrated across America – except by Florida’s governor. “Congress enacted the 12-month continuous eligibility reform to help families cut costs, ensure that children do not experience a harmful gap in health coverage, and to cut time-consuming bureaucratic red tape. As we have seen during the Medicaid “unwinding” in Florida, children often lose their health coverage for procedural reasons, not because they are no longer eligible. Through the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023, Congress acted to protect children’s access to care, which has long-term health and financial benefits for families and for states. “Yet, Governor DeSantis does not seem to care about violating the law or taking care of Florida’s kids. His Administration has disenrolled 22,576 children from KidCare since January 1, 2024,\\xa0for failing to pay premiums\\xa0despite explicit instructions to the contrary. Florida is the only state in the country that is brazenly disregarding the new federal protection for children. I have been contacted by parents whose sick children have been dropped from KidCare and can’t receive the timely health services they need. This should not be happening. “At the same time, the State of Florida is suing the Biden administration to overturn this 12-month protection for children\\xa0nationwide, simply because they don’t want to follow the law. This has led to a delay in the expansion of KidCare to children up to 300% of the federal poverty threshold, which is estimated to provide coverage to an additional 165,000 Florida children in five years. “The Governor and his administration are trying to twist the narrative but don’t believe them: they are violating the law and harming children and families.”',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON – U.S. Representative Pramila Jayapal (WA-07) released the following statement on her “no” vote on H.Res 1143: “Iran’s attack on Israel was a dangerous escalation in what could quickly turn into a larger regional war. I condemned the attack by Iran, as well as the precipitating hostilities that led to the attack, and I called for immediate de-escalation to reduce the threat of these actions widening into a larger regional conflict.\\xa0I also supported President Biden’s actions, along with allies, in thwarting the Iranian attack and defending Israel against those threats.\\xa0 “I voted no on this resolution because I am concerned that it further escalates the situation at exactly the time that we need to do the opposite. It does not mention the precipitating strike on the Iranian embassy by Israel that led to this attack. It ‘fully supports’ further offensive action by Israel and calls for continued arms sales to Israel. It makes no distinction between aid to Israel for defensive purposes—such as the Iron Dome funding or against threats from Hezbollah and Iran—versus aid to Israel for offensive strikes against innocent civilians in Gaza. While I continue to support defensive aid to Israel, I have been clear that I cannot support offensive military aid to Israel with no strings attached while the Netanyahu government continues to kill innocent civilians in Gaza — both through military action and the blocking of humanitarian aid leading to famine. “This is a time to de-escalate the conflict, not promote retaliatory violence, and I appreciate President Biden’s leadership on this issue. It is also of the utmost importance to achieve an immediate ceasefire to end the killing of innocents, return the hostages, and create a path for peace and security in the region.

       " 'Washington, DC—April 18, 2024…In response to Iran’s unprovoked attack on Israel last weekend, House Republicans passed a slew of legislation to deter further aggression from Iran and support our ally, Israel. Congressman Steve Womack (AR-3) supported every bill and is a cosponsor of two of them: H.R. 5947, To provide for the rescission of certain waivers and licenses relating to Iran, which passed the House of Representatives yesterday, and H. Res. 1143, Condemning Iran’s unprecedented drone and missile attack on Israel, which passed today. \\xa0 Congressman Womack said, “Iran, the leading state sponsor of terror and brazen human rights abuser, hasn’t changed their ultimate goal – destroying the State of Israel. House Republicans have stepped up where the Biden Administration has fallen short. Advancing legislation this week to deter further aggression from Iran is our strategic and moral obligation to our friend and ally. The United States must continue to stand in unwavering support of Israel in their fight to protect their people and rid the world of evil terrorists.” \\xa0 Bill breakdowns: \\xa0',\n",
       " 'Congressman Blaine Luetkemeyer (MO-03) introduced the Regulatory Transparency for Small Businesses Act. The bill forces federal agencies, when proposing a regulation, to identify an approximate number of small entities that will be affected by the regulation, NAICS Codes for those industries, and a cost per small entity. The agency must also provide the data used to make that determination.\\xa0 “On top of record inflation, workforce shortages and more, overregulation is costing our small business communities hundreds of thousands every year. As of 2021, the Biden Administration has issued 817 final rules costing $482.7 billion, resulting in 292.7 million hours of paperwork.” Said Congressman Luetkemeyer.” Part of the problem is that agencies are not being transparent about the potential impact the rules they are passing will have. This lack of transparency has led to many overburdensome rules that have negatively impacted small businesses across the nation. This bill will deter more harmful rules from passing by ensuring that agencies include critical information about how rules will impact small businesses before they can move forward with the rulemaking process.\\xa0\\xa0 Background: According to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), if an agency believes a rule will have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small businesses, they must construct regulatory flexibility analyses addressing cost of compliance and significant alternatives considered, along with other applicable metrics. In contrast, if an agency determines that a rule will not have such an impact, the head of the agency must “certify” that decision and is then free to continue with normal rulemaking procedures. Unfortunately, there is nothing in statue to define what criteria should be included when an agency certifies that a rule will not have a significant impact, leaving agencies free to unilaterally decide which rules are impactful to small businesses and which are not.\\xa0 Because of this, many rules in violation of the RFA have been enacted without any changes. One of the more notorious cases includes the recent Supreme Court ruling of Waters of the United States (WOTUS). Because agency heads erroneously certified that WOTUS would not significantly impact small businesses, the rulemaking process was finalized with essentially no changes.\\xa0\\xa0 The Regulatory Transparency for Small Businesses Act ensures agencies are no longer overlooking these critical preliminary measures when they certify and forces agencies to be transparent about their calculations.

       " 'For Immediate Release Contact: Taylor Haulsee Speaker Johnson joined Fox Business and CNN to discuss the House’s supplemental national security legislation \\xa0 \\xa0 WASHINGTON\\xa0—\\xa0This afternoon, after announcing the House’s national security supplemental plan, Speaker Johnson joined Larry Kudlow on Fox Business’ Kudlow and Jake Tapper on CNN’s The Lead to discuss the House plan, the need for urgent border security measures, and the motion to vacate. \\xa0 “What we’ve done is taken the Senate supplemental bill, and we’ve improved the process and the policy, and that’s a really important thing,” Speaker Johnson said.   Click here to watch Kudlow, here for The Lead \\xa0 On the supplemental national security package: \\xa0 What we’ve done is we’ve taken the senate supplemental bill, and we’ve improved the process and the policy, and that’s a really important thing. What we’ve done for example, in the Ukraine piece of this, is we’ve added the loan instrument concept, we’ve added the REPO Act – which everybody knows is the seizure of corrupt Russian oligarchs’ assets – to be used to fund the effort in Ukraine. We introduced a lot of new accountabilities and oversight. The Congress has a responsibility to do and the strategy shift as well. We’re going to require within 45 days, the White House to deliver to Congress a meaningful plan. What is the endgame here? What’s the objective and how are we going to accomplish this and bring this conflict to an end? \\xa0 By the way Larry, on Ukraine, 80% of what we’ll spend here goes to America’s industrial defense base, and that’s a replenishment of our stocks and weapons. And I think that’s a really important point. We’re also adding sanctions against Russia and Iran and all our adversaries including China, and that’s a really important thing as well. \\xa0 So, the House will do its will and have a rigorous amendment process to the underlying legislation. \\xa0 On the urgent need to support U.S. allies: \\xa0 You got to be tough on your adversaries. The problem is you and I both know, Larry, this President is projecting weakness on the world stage and that’s why all our nation’s enemies are acting so provocatively. On the Israel example, I mean, President Biden and Chuck Schumer had been criticizing Israel and appeasing Iran, that strategy should be exactly the opposite. We should be helping Israel and they’ve been turning their backs on them. \\xa0 And then of course, this encourages Xi and encourages China, when they see that we’re not going to stand strong and we’re not going to put the flag in the ground so to speak and hold the line. They’re going to act, they’re going to move, and we’re concerned about what China may do in Taiwan. We talk about it all the time. We’re certainly concerned about Iran’s open aggression now against Israel, our dear friend and ally. And Russia, of course, is still on the march in Ukraine. We must stand strong. A strong America is good for the entire world. We bring stability and peace – the perception that America is strong is important and has been since World War II and we cannot let down that responsibility. \\xa0 On border security: \\xa0 Some of my colleagues want the Speaker of the House to have a magic wand. If we could close the border ourselves, we would have done it a long time ago. We passed HR 2 over a year ago, it’s sitting on Chuck Schumer’s desk. That had all the components. It closes the border, changes asylum processes and problems, ends catch and release and in reinstates remain in Mexico. All the things that President Trump had done so effectively, Biden reflexively did the opposite. And that’s been the problem. \\xa0 We pass resolutions, we pass the laws, they sit on Chuck Schumer’s desk in the Senate because again, the Democrats run the Senate, the Democrats run the White House, and they want an open border. That voter ID, the idea that you would have to prove that you’re a US citizen to vote in a US election, a federal election, is critically important. We’re going to move that in the days ahead as well. That’s what we were talking about at Mar a Lago at the press conference. \\xa0 But the American people demand this, they deserve it. We know the border is a catastrophe. And the reason that we’re bringing to the floor this week, the End the Border Catastrophe Act, is because it’s aptly named. And it describes what is on the hearts and minds of every single American. It doesn’t matter where you live. I’ve been in 23 states in the last seven or eight weeks Larry traveling around the country. It doesn’t matter whether I’m out west, upstate New York, deep south, Midwest, it’s all the same. Everybody knows, this is what we must do. If you don’t have a secure border, you don’t have sovereignty; you don’t have security. You don’t even really have a nation. And that’s what Joe Biden has put at risk. And that’s why we had to impeach Mayorkas. \\xa0 On President Biden’s weakness: \\xa0 I think this sets up the next election, the next administration, the next president, and I believe [Trump is] going to win – in a better position. I think that President Trump is strong enough that he could enter the world stage and broker a peace deal in Ukraine, if Russia is still advancing at that time. I mean, I think he has the strong enough hand to be able to do that. And that’s why this election is so important. There’s a very stark contrast – you know we didn’t have all these global conflicts. We didn’t have hot wars around the globe when Donald Trump was the president. You know why? Because our adversaries feared him and respected. They don’t fear and respect Joseph Biden. And that’s a real problem for all of us. \\xa0 On the motion to vacate: \\xa0 I’m not asking the Democrats to get involved in that I believe the house will do as well. Look, I’m trying to govern and lead this institution at a very interesting, unprecedented time. We have challenges right now that no previous generation has faced. Newt Gingrich posted a few days ago on social media. The speaker’s job is effectively impossible. Now he said that I’m doing the hardest job that maybe it has ever been in the history of the U.S. House. Maybe, he said, arguably since the Civil War. Why because we live in a very divided time and very divisive politics in the age of social media. 24-hour news cycle, where everybody can express their opinions every moment of the day but things they’re disgruntled about. It makes a lot of challenges, but we’re going to get through this. Listen, we are the greatest nation in the history of the world. Okay, we are going to show that we’re going to keep the train on the tracks and not get derailed and get involved in all of this. It’s such a dangerous time on the world stage and that look, I don’t walk around thinking about the motion to vacate. It’s a procedural matter here that I think it’s been abused in recent times. Maybe at some point we change. Right now, I’ve got to do my job. And so do all my colleagues. And I’m confident at the end of the day, in spite of all the drama, and all the palace intrigue, I think we’re gonna get that done. \\xa0 ### \\n\\nTags: \\n Tweet\\n Share\\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tH-232, The Capitol\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWashington, D.C. 20515\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t202-225-4000\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t ©2024 U.S. House of Representatives.

       " 'Washington, DC—April 17, 2024…Today, Congressman Steve Womack (AR-3) joined a bipartisan, bicameral group of 22 Members of Congress in sending a letter to United States Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, decrying the United States Postal Service’s (USPS) recent nationwide consolidation and review announcements that could severely diminish mail service reliability for postal networks across the country, including in Arkansas.  \\xa0 “A common theme of these announcements is the so-called ‘modernization’ of Processing and Distribution Centers (P&DCs) into Local Processing Centers (LPCs),” the Members wrote. “Taken together, these proposals dismantle parts of the Postal Service’s robust network that helps distribute mail across the country and places outgoing sorting into more distant facilities.\\xa0 The result of this change is that mail will need to travel farther from its origin to its sorting, creating inefficiencies in the system, especially for local mail.” \\xa0 “These consolidation proposals never have had any discernible support from local communities.\\xa0 On the contrary, we have heard strong opposition to these efforts from USPS customers, community leaders, local businesses, and postal employees,” the Members continued. “Rather than marching forward with these plans and offering short and vague statements dismissing concerns, the Postal Service should be communicating why the organization believes these changes are beneficial and what the specific impact of the changes will be to mail service.” \\xa0 “The Postal Service provides an essential service upon which our constituents rely. \\xa0The robust nature of the Postal Service’s current network is its strength, not its weakness.\\xa0 To ensure that our constituents continue to receive reliable service, we urge you to reconsider these consolidation announcements,” the Members concluded. \\xa0 The announced network changes align with the Postal Service’s Delivering for America (DFA) plan. However, a recent review by the USPS Office of Inspector General for the implementation of the new Regional Processing and Distribution Center (RP&DC) in Richmond, Virginia, highlighted the problems with the USPS’s plan.\\xa0 That facility was the first to be converted to an RP&DC as a result of the DFA plan.\\xa0 The Inspector General’s review noted that challenges associated with changes to the facility “contributed to a decrease in service performance for the Richmond region that continued four months after launch.”\\xa0  \\xa0\\xa0 The letter can be read in full here. \\xa0 Congressman Womack initially expressed his concern for the consolidations and operational changes when USPS announced in November the Mail Processing Facility Review being conducted by USPS with respect to the NW Arkansas P&DC in Fayetteville, Arkansas.

       " 'Keynote Speech at National Consumer Law Center Spring Training Event Delivered Remotely\\nFriday, April 12 at 4 PM at Omni Hotel at Centennial Park\\xa0 Hello everyone, thank you for having me here this afternoon.\\xa0 It is my honor to have been invited to deliver the keynote address to this, the Spring Training Event of the National Association of Consumer Advocates, a group that I deeply respect and whose work I greatly admire.\\xa0 I want to thank you for your tireless efforts protecting the rights and interests of everyday people, workers, and consumers. For decades the pendulum has been stuck on the side of the powerful, the wealthy, and the greedy. So the rich have gotten richer, the middle class has shrunk, the poor are getting poorer, and the courthouse doors have gotten heavier and heavier to open for those seeking to hold the corporate and business interests accountable for the harms they do to the so called \"little guys\" of our nation. \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nAnd I want to thank particularly your Georgia members, who represent consumers when they get mistreated, cheated and/or ripped off by bad actors in the commercial sector. When your members are seeking relief for the consumers they represent, they are more and more met with the barrier posed by forced arbitration clauses imbedded in take it or leave it contracts, or terms of service agreements.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nUsing consumer protection statutes as the shield to protect your clients, your members empower consumers to stand up for their legal rights despite the deck being stacked against them. \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nLegislatively nullifying and banning pre-dispute forced arbitration clauses in consumer and employment agreements has been a cause that I took on shortly after being sworn in as a member of Congress, almost 18 years ago. I cant believe that it’s been 18 years! It’s been a long slog to make change, but we have seen the Forced Arbitration Injustice Repeal Act pass out of the House and on to the Senate the past two sessions of Congress. There is still much work to be done to get the FAIR Act passed in the House AND Senate, then signed into law by the President. The task is daunting, but we are making progress and as long as I am a member of Congress I will never give up on passing the FAIR Act into law.\\xa0 I hung a shingle and practiced law for 27 years before being elected to Congress. During those 27 years, I also served for 12 years as a Magistrate Court Judge presiding over small claims court cases, among other responsibilities. During all those years, handling so many cases -- only once did I encounter the barrier of forced arbitration. It was about three months before I shut the doors to my law practice at the end of 2006. A friend brought in a case against her seeking the confirmation of an arbitration award in a debt collection case. One of my last acts as an attorney was to work out a payment plan after having determined that my client was bound to the arbitration award due to the consumer agreement that she had signed.\\xa0 The next time I encountered forced arbitration was a year or two later, when my wife and I were thinking about downsizing and we were looking at building a townhome. In reviewing the documents, I came across a clause that required us to waive our rights to file a lawsuit in court in the event of the builder’s default under the terms of the contract. The contract mandated that any dispute with the builder/developer would have to be adjudicated via arbitration. I don\\'t remember the fine details in the contract about the selection of the arbitrator, the venue of the proceeding, who pays the costs, etc., but I do recall walking away from the deal with a bad feeling about the developer and how unfair the deal was, after they refused to cross out the arbitration clause in the agreement.\\xa0 Since then, I have witnessed the explosion in the use of forced arbitration clauses in just about every transaction in which a little guy engages, in the process of living a regular life during these rapidly changing times in which we live.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nForced arbitration is a trick used by the powerful to prevent the less powerful from suing them in court in front of a jury of their peers. From terms-of-use agreements with cell phone service providers and social media companies to opening a bank account,\\xa0 purchasing or leasing a car, to agreements needing to be signed to place our loved ones in a nursing home -- one can expect to be forced to sign or acknowledge that they are waiving their right to go to court in the event of a dispute, and agree to be bound by the arbitration process. Its a take-it-or-leave-it situation, and the consumer is forced to waive their rights if they want a cell phone, because you cant find a provider that offers service that doesn\\'t require forced arbitration.\\xa0 So how did we get to this point where if you want a job, or to purchase just about every good or service in America, you are required to sign away your 7th Amendment right to a trial by jury in a court of law? The floodgates for forced arbitration were opened wide by our very own Federalist Society stacked federal and state judiciaries, led by an activist Supreme Court of the United States. That\\'s why I have filed legislation that unpacks the Supreme Court by adding four justices, legislation that would impose 18-year term limits on Supreme Court justices, legislation adding 77 new federal district court judgeships, and in the last Congress and in the next session of Congress, I will introduce legislation to increase the number of judgeships on the nation’s federal courts of appeals. In the 1995 case of Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v Dobson (513 U.S. 283), Justice (Sandra Day) O’Connor wrote: “over the past decade the Supreme Court has abandoned all pretense of ascertaining congressional intent with respect to the Federal Arbitration Act, building instead, case by case, and edifice of its own creation.” Justice O’Connor was spot on with her analysis. Starting in the 1980’s, the Supreme Court began transforming the Federal Arbitration Act into something never intended by Congress, which passed the Act in 1925 to provide an alternative by which businesses of equal standing and power could resolve disputes without protracted litigation in court.\\xa0 Under current Supreme Court law, arbitration can be forced upon the much less powerful consumer by the wealthy and powerful corporation, by way of a take-it-or-leave it contract. And I don\\'t have to tell you all of the disadvantage the consumer faces when forced into arbitration when a dispute arises. Nor must I convince you that the threat of a jury trial levels the playing field for the consumer against the wealthy and powerful business against whom the dispute arose.\\xa0 Passage of the FAIR Act would render unenforceable forced arbitration clauses in in consumer agreements. The legislation currently has 100 cosponsors, and when Democrats controlled the House we passed the FAIR Act 225 to 186 in the 116th Congress, and 222 to 209 in the 117th Congress.\\xa0 Momentum will continue to build towards passage, and I\\'m grateful to see the progress that has been made. But clearly, we still have a lot of work to do. The good news is that I ain\\'t no ways tired!\\xa0 With your support, we will continue the battle to protect consumers, and we will continue to fight until we win. You have my full support as you battle in the trenches for your client, and please know that you will always have an advocate in congress working with you to protect our clients! Thank you, and have a great training event!\\n\\xa0\\n###\\n\\xa0',\n",

The Congresswoman’s remarks come at a time of rising tensions in the Middle East, following the Iranian military’s attack on Israel as well as the Israeli military’s attack on the Iranian consulate in Syria. Since the horrific October 7th attack, Congresswoman Pressley has consistently and stridently called for a ceasefire to save lives, return all hostages, and surge humanitarian aid to Gaza. To date, nearly 34,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli airstrikes and over 100 hostages are still held captive by Hamas in Gaza. A transcript of the Congresswoman’s remarks is available below and the full video is available here. Transcript: In Floor Speech, Pressley Urges De-Escalation in Middle East, Renews Call for CeasefireU.S. House of RepresentativesApril 17, 2024 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention to the massacre of the Palestinian people and the urgent need to de-escalate the Middle East. For months now, after the brutal attack on October 7th, the world has watched in horror as the crisis in Gaza has worsened daily. Today, less than two hundred days later, nearly 34,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces. Every day that goes by without a ceasefire is another day that Palestinians are subjected to violence, starvation, death, and destruction. And every day that we do not de-escalate the region, more lives are put at risk. Mr. Speaker, I condemn the Iranian military’s attack on Israel and I condemn the Israeli military’s attack on the Iranian consulate in Syria.\\xa0 These escalations are dangerous. And we now find ourselves at a critical inflection point. We can either leverage diplomacy to de-escalate tensions and push for peace, or we can stand idly by as this spirals into a broader regional conflict that will result in more loss of life – Palestinian, Israeli, and American. We must de-escalate. And facilitating a lasting ceasefire in the region is the only path forward. Some of my colleagues seem all too willing to rush into an endless war with Iran and continue providing a blank check to the Israeli military. Right now, Palestinians in Gaza are being starved, bombed, tortured and executed. Generations of Palestinian families have been wiped out. Over 2 million are displaced from homes that have been razed to the ground. Make no mistake: history will remember this moment as a genocide.\\xa0 We cannot bomb our way to peace, and the U.S. must stop using our tax dollars to arm the Israeli military with more bombs and bullets. The same bombs and bullets that have been used to kill over 14,000 children in Gaza. Shameful. It’s why we see momentum across the globe in support of a ceasefire.\\xa0 Millions are marching peacefully in the streets.\\xa0 A ceasefire is the mandate. A ceasefire to surge humanitarian aid. A ceasefire to bring all the hostages home. A ceasefire to save lives. We will never be silent in the face of injustice.\\xa0 Ceasefire now. \\xad— Throughout this conflict, Rep. Pressley has been a vocal and consistent advocate of diplomacy, de-escalation, and saving lives. ### Washington DC Office 402 Cannon HOB\\r\\nWashington, DC 20515 Phone (202) 225-5111\\r\\nFax (202) 225-9322 District Office 1295 River Street\\r\\nHyde Park, MA 02136 Phone (617) 850-0040\\r\\nFax (202) 225-9322',\n",

Res. 1326 in 2010 calling on Japan to \"address the urgent problem of abduction to and retention of United States citizen children\" and in 2014, the Sean and David Goldman International Child Abduction Prevention and Return Act was signed into law to \"prevent the terrible crime of international parental child abduction and empower the U.S. executive branch with tools to address this problem bilaterally with countries of particular concern.\" \"Regrettably, the abduction of American children to your country remains an ongoing human rights crisis that cannot be sidelined or overlooked,\" Smith wrote. \"When a country such as Japan has failed to resolve 30 percent of abduction cases that have been pending more than 12 months, U.S. law requires the Secretary of State to take action.\" Smith wrote that the Goldman Act has helped return U.S. citizen children from other countries but \"Japan has not assisted in any notable returns.\" Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida speaks during a news conference in the Rose Garden of the White House on April 10, 2024.\\xa0(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File) Smith wrote in his letter that the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children has found that abduction victims are often taught by their kidnapper that the left-behind parent \"doesn\\'t want them\" or that the left-behind parent is \"dangerous,\" \"harmful,\" \"dead\" or \"unknown.\" \"This trauma is not easily erased,\" Smith wrote. Unlike many other countries, Japan does not allow dual custody of children for their divorced parents. Only one parent can take the children, though the other parent can gain visitation rights. In some cases, the parent with custody blocks contact with the other one. There have been some high-profile cases of custody disputes brought up by foreign husbands divorced from Japanese women accusing them of child abduction. \"Your Excellency, it is my sincere hope that these Japanese American children will become a source of strength between our two countries rather than a reminder of an ongoing injustice and a barrier to a robust United States-Japan relationship,\" Smith concluded in his letter.\\xa0 \"I respectfully request that you work with the United States to create a process by which families can be reunited and heal.\" President Biden, left, and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida toast during an official State Dinner at the White House in Washington, D.C., April 10, 2024.\\xa0(REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein) In a statement to Fox News Digital, Japan\\'s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, \"Since the Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (the so-called \"Hague Convention\") entered into force in Japan in 2014, Japan has been taking appropriate measures to deal with cases covered by the Hague Convention through cooperation with each contracting state based on the Convention.\" \"Regarding cross-border child abduction cases between Japan and the U.S., the relevant authorities in both countries cooperate to appropriately respond to such cases.\" The statement continued, \"The Government of Japan has explained the position of the Government of Japan, including the above points, to relevant U.S. officials, including Congressman Smith.\" Fox News Digital\\'s Matthew Noyes and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

       " \"Arkansas is known as the Natural State for a reason. It's a world-class destination for all who love to bike, rock climb, hunt, fish, hike, and more. Outdoor recreation is more than just a pastime here; it's part of our heritage. As an Arkansan, my profound love for our lands and outdoor recreation has been foundational in my role as Chairman of the Natural Resources Committee.  As Chairman, I am privileged to champion forward-thinking legislation, such as the Expanding Public Lands Outdoor Recreation Experiences Act, also known as the EXPLORE Act. This bill is a product of months of collaboration with folks on both sides of the aisle, united in our goal to make outdoor recreation more accessible nationwide.  The EXPLORE Act will modernize visitor experiences at parks, increase accessibility for veterans and service members outdoors, create new opportunities and trails for outdoorsmen and women to recreate, and support local communities that depend on access to our public lands. The bill also includes key priorities for Arkansans, like reopening overnight camping at Albert Pike Recreation Area, protecting battlefields, and creating more parking and restroom facilities at some of our favorite sites.  I believe that our lands should be enjoyed by all, and that's why I'm proud that the U.S. House of Representatives passed the EXPLORE Act this week with overwhelming bipartisan support. The passage of this landmark legislation is a testament to the future of outdoor recreation and conservation in our nation. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the upper chamber to pass EXPLORE in the Senate and swiftly send it to the President’s desk.  \",\n",

       " 'Ventura, CA – On Wednesday, April 3, Congresswoman Julia Brownley (D-CA) presented $963,000 to the County of Ventura to upgrade the region’s 15-year-old analog simulcast radio communications system. The funds will go toward establishing a state-of-the-art digital radio communication system which will utilize 700MHz frequencies. The upgraded radio system will be used by all public safety entities throughout the county to improve communications interoperability for public safety and first responder individuals as they respond to incidents and disasters. “The importance of ensuring our law enforcement and public safety entities in Ventura County have access to high-quality, reliable communications equipment cannot be overstated,” said Congresswoman Julia Brownley. “Not only will this state-of-the-art communication system facilitate better communication and coordination between agencies, but all of our cities and residents will benefit from streamlined services that will lower costs and redundancies. This is truly a win-win for everyone across the region. In advocating for this project, my motivation was to ensure that our renowned and sophisticated law enforcement, public safety professionals, and first responders have the renowned and sophisticated equipment they need to support their mission and their work.” Residents throughout Ventura County will benefit from the upgraded system as it will allow agencies at both the city and county level to access the latest communications technology and transform the current analog radio system to digital. As well, the new radio system includes substantial cost reductions to local agencies by preventing expensive and redundant investments in singular radio communications systems, providing centralized and more comprehensive support for the first responders radio system. “As a first responder, I can tell you every moment counts,” stated Ventura County Sheriff Jim Fryhoff. “These upgrades will improve communications interoperability across our first responder agencies and ultimately lead to faster and more comprehensive response to incidents in our community.” The regional system will broadcast from 19 towers across the county and communications from those on scene and enroute can be repeated. In the current state, radio traffic from cities can often not reach beyond their municipal borders, making it harder for them to coordinate mutual aid from outside agencies until they are within range. Additional advantages of the upgraded system include data and media transmission through cellular integration with other smart devices and connection with FirstNet for nationwide interoperability. “Our county has experienced a number of incidents that have demonstrated the importance of clear and timely communication across our public safety entities,” stated Ventura County Supervisor Janice Parvin, Vice Chair of the Board of Supervisors. “We are grateful for Congresswoman Brownley’s recognition of the importance of this project.” \\r\\n                            Issues: 118th Congress, Local Issues, Transportation and Infrastructure  2262 Rayburn House Office Building\\nWashington, DC 20515\\nPhone: (202) 225-5811\\nFax: (202) 225-1100\\nHours: Monday – Friday 9:00am-6:00pm Eastern 223 E.

       " 'Rep. Chris Smith chairs a congressional hearing on Turkey’s shocking human rights abuses and aggressive transnational repression on Tuesday, April 16, 2024. Nadine Maenza, Enes Kanter Freedom, and Abdulhamit Bilici testify at Smith’s hearing. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ), Co-Chair of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, today chaired a congressional hearing exposing the shocking human rights abuses and aggressive transnational repression of the Government of Turkey under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0“Since 2016, the government of Turkey has, according to the US Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, ‘arrested or imprisoned more than 95,000 citizens, and closed more than 1,500 nongovernmental organizations…primarily for alleged ties to the movement of cleric Fethullah Gulen,’” said Smith. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0“This Commission—and the US Congress—considers itself a friend of the Turkish people,” Smith continued. “And when the Government of Turkey commits grave human rights violations against its own people, this friendship means that we stand with the people,” said Smith. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0“We call on the government of Turkey to change its course of human rights abuses,” said Smith, who cited a host of shocking abuses of human rights by the Turkish government, including arbitrary killings, suspicious deaths of persons in custody, forced disappearances, torture, arbitrary arrest and continued detention of tens of thousands of persons, and severe restrictions on freedom of expression and press freedom. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0Among the experts testifying at Smith’s hearing was Enes Kanter Freedom, a human rights activist and former professional basketball star who was fired by the NBA for protesting the horrific human rights violations of the Chinese Communist Party. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0In his testimony, Freedom shared personal encounters with Turkey’s transnational repression after he began speaking out against human rights abuses committed by President Erdogan. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0“The Turkish government asked the US government to extradite me, canceled my passport, put my name on an Interpol list, imprisoned my father, and set a $500,000 bounty on my head,” said Freedom. “In 9 years, I received 12 arrest warrants and countless death threats.” \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0“They tried to attack me in front of a mosque in Boston, run social media campaigns against me, and pressured American universities, NGOs, and political groups to cancel their events with me,” said Freedom, who recounted two instances in 2017 in Indonesia and Romania where local officials tried to kidnap and arrest him to send him back to Turkey. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Other experts testifying at Smith’s hearing included Abdulhamit Bilici, the former Editor in Chief of Zaman who shared his own experience as a victim of Turkey’s transnational repression, and Nadine Maenza, the President of IRF Secretariat and former Chair of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF). \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0“I personally experienced both national and transnational repression as a journalist,” said Bilici. “I was the editor in chief of Zaman daily, the largest newspaper in Turkey. The Erdogan government brutally raided my newspaper in March 2016, five months before the coup attempt, and they shut down the paper after the coup attempt together with 200 critical media outlets.” \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0“When Erdogan regime took over the paper, the first thing they did was to fire me and to appoint a pro-government editor who converted the newspaper into a regime mouthpiece in 24 hours,” Bilici continued. “Facing serious threats, I had to leave the country for my safety.” \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0Maenza spoke to Turkey’s severe violations of religious freedom, including its persecution of Christians: “The government refuses to grant legal personality to many religious communities and continues to block the reopening of the Greek Orthodox Halki seminary. Many religious and ethnic minorities face harassment and discrimination, including Alevis, the largest religious minority in the country. Their houses of worship are not recognized by the government and are subjected to vandalism and attacks.” \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0“Turkey continues to criminalize blasphemy under article 216(3) of the Penal code,” Maenza added. “This is generally politically motivated against those accused of insulting or mocking Islam and to intimidate or retaliate against critics of President Erdogan.” \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0Smith, who meets regularly with people persecuted by foreign governments that target and pursue them inside the United States, urged his colleagues to support his Transnational Repression Policy Act (HR 3654) in response to the Biden Administration’s weak response to foreign governments’ attempts to harm, intimidate, silence, abduct, or spy on members of diaspora and exile communities within the US and other countries. ### Chris has three offices dedicated to constituent services.

       " '\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ), Chair of the House Global Human Rights Subcommittee, introduced legislation (HR 7891) this week aimed at ensuring that cobalt—a key natural resource used to power electric vehicles, solar panels and other “green” products—that is extracted or processed with the use of child or forced labor in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) does not enter the United States market. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0China processes 90 percent of the world’s cobalt, most of which comes from China-owned mines in the DRC. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0“The Communist Chinese government—which has gained almost full dominance of every single step of the cobalt supply chain—profits from child and forced labor used to extract cobalt in the Democratic Republic of Congo and power our so-called ‘green economy,’” said Rep. Chris Smith, who also serves as Chair of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China and Co-Chair of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 “The United States must stop aiding and abetting Communist China’s egregious exploitation of children—some as young as 6 years old—and start becoming less dependent on Xi Jinping’s brutal dictatorship,” said Smith, who also authored the China Trade Relations Act (HR 638), which would require China to stop its horrific human rights violations if it wishes to enjoy normal trade relations with the United States. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0Specifically, Smith’s bill—the Stop China’s Exploitation of Congolese Children and Adult Forced Labor through Cobalt Mining Act—would require the US Forced Labor Enforcement Task Force to lead a comprehensive investigation into the use of forced labor in the cobalt mining industry of the DRC and develop a strategy to ensure that cobalt mined by forced labor does not enter the US market. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0The bill text was crafted with key input from the House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rep. Jason Smith (R-MO), whose committee has jurisdiction over the legislation and is scheduled to mark it up on Wednesday, fast tracking it for a vote on the House Floor. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0“America has long fought to end child and adult forced labor, yet the cobalt vital to the batteries in our technology is unethically mined with the use of forced labor under Chinese control,” said Rep. Jason Smith. “This legislation is a critical step to blocking material tainted by these inhumane labor practices from entering this country. I am thankful to Rep. Chris Smith for introducing this legislation to stop these dangerous practices.” \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The legislation is drawn in part from insightful testimony provided at the congressional hearing chaired by Rep. Chris Smith in November that exposed the Chinese Communist Party’s egregious exploitation of Congolese children and forced laborers, who toil in hazardous conditions to extract cobalt from unsafe mines including artisanal mines in the DRC. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The hearing built on one that Rep. Chris Smith chaired last Congress that included testimony from Fr. Rigobert Minani Bihuzo, a Catholic priest from the DRC who has helped lead efforts to expose China’s horrific human rights abuses across the country. Fr. Bihuzo stated: “The number of artisanal and small-scale mining sites from the Ituri region to Lake Tanganyika is estimated to be 1,000 and the number of artisanal miners to be 200,000 people, among them thousands of children and pregnant women.” \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0Rep. Chris Smith said the artisanal mines “are often no more than narrow shafts dug into the ground, which is why children are recruited—and in many cases forced—to descend into them, using only their hands or rudimentary tools without any protective equipment, to extract cobalt and other minerals.” \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0“The biggest beneficiaries of this cobalt continue to remain silent and refuse to face this uncomfortable truth: from dirt to battery, from cobalt to cars, the entire system is fueled by violence, cruelty, and corruption,” Rep. Chris Smith said. ### Chris has three offices dedicated to constituent services.

       " 'For Immediate Release April 14, 2024 Contact:\\xa0Taylor Haulsee \\xa0 \\xa0 WASHINGTON\\xa0—\\xa0Today, Speaker Johnson joined Fox News’ Sunday Morning Futures to discuss Iran’s attack on Israel, supplemental national security legislation, securing the border, preventing non-citizens from voting, and FISA. Below are key excerpts from the interview.  Click\\xa0here\\xa0to watch the full interview \\xa0 On support for Israel: \\xa0 Well, we’ve understood the urgency of this from the very beginning. I mean, a few days after I became speaker way back in October, we passed our Israel support package. It’s been sitting on Chuck Schumer’s desk ever since because we included a pay for as you remember. What a concept, we took from the IRS expansion slush fund to pay for the Israel priority. We tried it again, just about a month and a half ago, a clean Israel, that many Democrats 166, as I remember in the House, voted against.Why? Because President Joe Biden said that he would veto that. So, the House Republicans and the Republican Party understand the necessity of standing with Israel. We’re going to try again this week, and the details of that package are being put together. Right now, we’re looking at the options and all these supplemental issues. \\xa0 … I do think that we showed resolve last night thankfully, many of us were concerned about that to stand with our ally Israel. It’s critically important to do that. We took down most of those drones and missiles, as you noted, and our other allies stepped up as well. What’s important right now is that we stand with Israel. We should not be dictating to them what their policy is; we certainly shouldn’t be doing what Chuck Schumer did, trying to suggest they should have new elections at this critical time. They’re fighting for their very existence, and it’s never been more important for us to be there with them. And we’re resolved to do that. I hope that continues. \\xa0 On supplemental legislation: \\xa0 I had a great visit with [Trump] at Mar-a-Lago on Friday, and he and I are 100% united on these big agenda items. And when you talk about aid to Ukraine, he’s introduced the loan lease concept, which is a really important one, I think has a lot of consensus as well as these other ideas – the REPO Act, which we’ve discussed, which is seizing the the assets of corrupt Russian oligarchs to help pay for this resistance. I think these are ideas that I think can get consensus, and that’s what we’ve been working through. We’ll send our package, we’ll put something together and send it to the Senate and get these obligations completed. \\xa0 On securing the border: \\xa0 What Marjorie fails to notice is that we have been fighting on the border. We fight on it every day. We passed our comprehensive border security package HR 2, at the very beginning of this Congress. It has been sitting on Chuck Schumer’s desk. We pass these acts out of the House, and they get stopped in the Senate. See this the open-border Democrats control the Senate and the White House, obviously. So we’ve not been able to have a lawmaking exercise to meet that critical objective, but we’re fighting every day. That’s why we’ve been demanding that President Biden use his executive authority to seal that border. President Trump reiterated that demand at our press conference together on Friday. We need the White House to step up. \\xa0 On preventing non-citizens from voting: \\xa0 Well, listen, some [democrats] have admitted to us even on record in Judiciary Committee hearings that they want illegals to vote, they’ve allowed it in some municipal elections. What Congress has control over is federal elections. We have to do every single thing we can to secure their elections are free and fair. And one thing we need to do and this is what we’re about to the House Republicans are about to enter legislation in the record that will ensure that no illegal can vote in a federal election. You have to prove you’re a citizen, instead of as the law currently states, just checking a box to say it. \\xa0 On FISA: \\xa0 Yeah, President [Trump] and I agree on the necessity of the uses of FISA. Remember that’s how we killed terrorists. That’s how we stopped her as plots and on US soil. That’s why we haven’t had had another 911 since that terrible tragedy. President Trump used it and he reauthorized it in 2018 for six years. And that’s why it’s up again. What we did was we changed the bill to fit his requirements and ours and that is that it would expire now, two years from now in the middle of his next administration. So he’s the one that gets to determine what’s working well, it’s a critical tool to stop terrorism. That the whole point of the law is that we surveil foreign persons foreign terrorist, but the reason the warrant requirement is not helpful. And the reason that people that we love and respect like Mike Pompeo and John Ratcliffe and, and Robert O’Brien and Devin Nunez, who’ve been in the intelligence community and are our guys, are conservatives who came off Judiciary Committee, a couple of them. They said you can’t put the warrant on this. Here’s what happens quick scenarios. This is important for people to understand, Maria. \\xa0 If we’re surveilling a terrorist in the Middle East, and the terrorist sends an email to a guy named John Smith in any town USA, and the email says the components will be delivered to your house this afternoon for further assembly and delivery to the high school stadium during the game. I think every American would want the analyst who saw that email from that foreign terrorist to do a query of the other communications between those two persons. That is not unlawful and that must continue. If that analysts had to get a warrant before that, it would add a huge time delay; the courts are not set up to be able to to handle all that volume. And Americans may die. We want to look at those emails and find out my goodness, which high school stadium? What time? And is this a bomb? And what are the components? We have to continue that to save American lives. That’s what’s at stake. This is not this is not searches on American citizens. If they were going to search John Smith, they would have to go get a warrant to do anything else. But this is lawfully collected data under Section 702. And it must continue. \\xa0 ### \\n\\nTags: \\n Tweet\\n Share\\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tH-232, The Capitol\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWashington, D.C. 20515\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t202-225-4000\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t ©2024 U.S. House of Representatives.

       " 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Congressman Neal Dunn, M.D. (Florida-02) and Congresswoman Angie Craig (Minnesota-02) introduced the Improving CARE for Youth Act. The bill allows for same-day billing for mental health services for youth Medicaid beneficiaries who are being seen for a primary care service. “Our youth’s mental health is worse than it’s ever been, especially following the destructive COVID-19 lockdowns. Protecting the future of the youth in our country is too important to be hindered by a Medicaid billing restriction,” said Congressman Dunn. “Fixing same-day billing for Medicaid beneficiaries may seem like a small change, but it will have a big impact. We must ensure all children have access to the quality care they need.” “We should be doing everything we can to make it easier for children to access the high-quality mental health care they deserve. That’s why I introduced this bipartisan bill with my colleague Rep. Dunn to remove mental health care barriers for children on Medicaid. I’ll keep fighting to expand access to mental health services for Americans of all ages and backgrounds,” said Congresswoman Craig. Currently, a provider can only bill once per day for a Medicaid patient. This creates a barrier to mental health care when a child covered by Medicaid is seen for a primary care appointment and a mental health need is identified. If the primary care doctor wants to refer the patient to a mental health provider on staff, the practice cannot bill for the mental health service in the same day and get Medicaid reimbursement, creating an unnecessary barrier to care. “As a family physician, I know that improving access to mental health and primary care services for Medicaid beneficiaries is critical, particularly as we continue to see increased rates of youth mental health concerns. That’s why the American Academy of Family Physicians is pleased to endorse the Improving CARE for Youth Act, which will ensure Medicaid coverage of mental health and primary care services provided on the same day. The AAFP has long supported efforts to improve behavioral health integration in primary care and we are pleased this bipartisan legislation will help address coverage and financial barriers for patients.” – Steven P. Furr, MD, FAAFP, President, American Academy of Family Physicians.\\xa0 “Pediatricians are witnessing the national emergency in youth mental health in our clinics, practices and hospitals across the country. Barriers to integrating mental health into pediatric primary such as insurance restrictions for same-day billing for a child’s medical and mental health care limit access to needed services. The Improving Coordination and Access to Resources Equitably for Youth Act would prohibit this practice in Medicaid thereby helping ensure that children can receive the care they need. The American Academy of Pediatrics endorses this legislation, urges its swift passage, and thanks Representatives Neal P. Dunn, MD (R-FL) and Angie Craig (D-Minn.) for their leadership on this legislation,” said American Academy of Pediatrics President Ben Hoffman, MD, FAAP.\\xa0 “In the wake of a worsening youth mental health crisis, it’s essential that we make mental health services accessible to all children,” said Saul Levin, M.D., M.P.A., CEO and Medical Director of the American Psychiatric Association. “Removing Medicaid’s billing restrictions for those seeking mental health and primary care services on the same day will enhance integration and make care more accessible for those in need.” ### Permalink: https://dunn.house.gov/2024/4/congressman-dunn-introduces-bill-to-ensure-access-to-mental-health-services-for-children-on-medicaid',\n",
       " '\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 In a hand delivered-letter to Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio following his address to the US Congress late last week, Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ) made a direct appeal to the Japanese leader to personally intervene and help return over 500 American children who have been abducted to Japan to their left-behind parents in the United States. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0“As our two countries continue to take steps to strengthen our democratic, economic and security ties, I would like to draw your attention to an open wound that threatens to derail many ongoing efforts,” Smith wrote in his letter to Fumio.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0“To date, more than 500 American children have been abducted to Japan by one of their respective parents and remain separated from their American parent. These abductions often occur against pre-existing court orders and, in some cases, with the passport assistance of the Japanese government,” Smith said in the letter. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0In his letter, Smith cited just a few of the parents who have been denied access to their children in Japan, including Jeffery Morehouse—who has been fighting for the return of his young son Mochi since 2010 and has testified at several congressional hearings chaired by Smith. Despite having legal custody in Washington State which was recognized by Japanese courts, Morehouse still cannot gain access to his son in Japan. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0Other parents who have testified before Smith’s committee and who were named in his letter include Retired Navy Capt. Paul Toland, Former Marine Corps Sgt. Michael Elias, and Randy Collins of California. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0“For the sake of the children who are suffering, and for the sake of U.S. and Japanese relations, I seek your public commitment to reunite these families,” Smith continued in the letter. “I respectfully request that you work with the United States to create a process by which families can be reunited and heal.” \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0Smith, a renowned human rights defender who successfully fought for the return of a New Jersey child who had been abducted to Brazil in the mid-2000s and held there for five years, has chaired 16 comprehensive congressional hearings on the issue to date and authored the groundbreaking US law to combat international parental child abduction. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0Signed into law in 2014, Smith’s Sean and David Goldman International Child Abduction Prevention and Return Act—named after the New Jersey father and son he helped reunite in 2009—empowers the US Executive Branch with tools to prevent the terrible crime of international parental child abduction and address the problem bilaterally with countries of particular concern. The law has helped with the return of other US citizen children, but Japan has not assisted in any notable returns. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0“Mr. Prime Minister, there is no doubt that child abduction is a form of child abuse. Children who are kidnapped by one parent to live overseas and kept away from another are at grave risk of serious mental trauma, and may experience anxiety, eating disorder, nightmares, mood swings, sleep disturbances, aggressive behavior, resentment, guilt, and fearfulness,” Smith said in the letter. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0“Regrettably, the abduction of American children to your country remains an ongoing human rights crisis that cannot be sidelined or overlooked. As I have said before, ‘when a country such as Japan has failed to resolve 30 percent of abduction cases that have been pending more than 12 months, U.S. law requires the Secretary of State to take action,’” the Smith letter continued. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0“It is my sincere hope that these Japanese American children will become a source of strength between our two countries rather than a reminder of an ongoing injustice and a barrier to a robust United States-Japan relationship,” Smith said in the letter. ### Chris has three offices dedicated to constituent services.

       " 'FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE |\\xa0Contact: Olivia Porcaro 202-225-6165 Today, April 15th, is Tax Day – the day that individual income tax returns are due to be submitted to the federal government. As the American people and I file our tax returns today, I am reflecting on the American economy and the importance of pro-growth tax policy in our nation.   Long ago, the United States of America became known as the economic powerhouse of the globe – having the largest economy in the world. Since then, we have remained a global leader in business and innovation. However, our nation is now locked in an increasingly intense economic rivalry with China. In fact, put together, the United States and China make up about 40 percent of global output.   Now, as this rivalry continues to intensify, it is important to note that the U.S. economy does beat out China’s by dollar value. Yet, China dominates the supply chains for necessities like solar panels, electronics, cars, steel, plastic, batteries, and other everyday goods. So, in order to remain as the economic leader of the world, it is important to ensure that our domestic tax code fosters a favorable economic environment that encourages American innovation, which will, in turn, give us a stronger competitive edge against Communist China.  This is why, in 2017, I supported historic, pro-growth tax reform legislation that helped our economy boom and allowed Americans to keep more of their hard-earned money – the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. In fact, according to the Tax Foundation, in Oklahoma alone, this bill helped to create more than 3,870 jobs and raised the median household income by over $560.  In addition to promoting individual economic growth, I am a strong believer in maintaining a competitive corporate tax code in order to incentivize businesses to set up and maintain operations in America, rather than moving abroad. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act did just that by reducing the corporate tax rate, and, in turn, allowing American businesses to flourish within our borders, instead of within China’s.  Now, I also want to emphasize that a competitive corporate tax code does not just benefit large American corporations.   As an Oklahoman, I know the importance of small businesses back at home. In fact, small businesses employ more than half of Oklahomans and are very vital to our state’s economy. Rest assured - the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act’s reduction of the corporate tax rate benefits them too, as it allows them to keep more of their earnings, and, therefore, expand operations and employ more workers.  Lastly, I believe increasing the child tax credit is imperative. This, along with many other reasons, is why I was proud to support the bipartisan Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act earlier this year. This bill builds on the successful Tax Cuts and Jobs Act by providing $20 billion in enhancements for the child tax credit, as well as $200 billion in tax incentives for job creators and American workers.  At the end of the day, the U.S. tax code should be written to benefit the American economy, families, workers, and small businesses, not hurt them. However, in recent years, it has not felt this way, as Americans are being crushed by high interest rates, skyrocketing inflation, and lower real wages. This is unacceptable. As we come up on the expiration of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2025, it is imperative that Congress and the Administration work together to sign legislation, like the Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act, into law. We must give our economy a much-needed boost, expand growth and opportunity, increase America’s competitive edge, and do everything we can to remain the economic powerhouse of the world.

       " 'This Week With Gosar April 14, 2024     Gosar Votes Against Spy Bill, Overwhelming Majority Polled Oppose FISA This week, I voted against legislation reauthorizing Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) for two more years.   A few months ago, I wrote an Op-Ed expressing my concerns about reauthorizing FISA without significant reform.\\xa0 If you missed it, here it is!  Backup: Section 702 of FISA was enacted by\\xa0Congress in 2008 to ostensibly allow the United States intelligence community, including the FBI, to\\xa0surveil foreigners located abroad. Purportedly, Congress wrote this law to protect\\xa0our national security by allowing spying on non-U.S. threats without a court order. However, FISA was never intended to spy on U.S. citizens.\\xa0   Unfortunately, Section 702 has been controversial since its inception, and it has been highly scrutinized by civil liberties advocates and privacy rights activists.   The government\\'s ability to collect and analyze the communications of foreigners without a warrant has also led to the collection of communications of American citizens and raises serious concerns about the indiscriminate and broad nature of the surveillance program, further infringing on the rights of Americans.   For example, the FBI has abused Section 702 to conduct warrantless searches against American citizens more than 278,000 times.  Unless it is reauthorized by Congress, FISA is set to expire next Friday.  Now that you’re up to speed, several amendments were offered that would have reformed FISA including a commonsense amendment offered by my friend, Representative Biggs, that I voted for that would have prevented warrantless searches of Americans. \\xa0Sadly, 86 Republicans and 126 Democrats inexplicably voted to allow the deep state to continue spying on Americans without a warrant by voting down this amendment.   As a result, I could not support the warrantless surveillance of American reauthorized under section 702. \\xa0It is a clear overreach of authority and is a direct violation of the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures.  Earlier this week and before voting, I sent a flash poll to faithful Gosar Newsletter readers asking you to share your opinion on whether FISA should be reauthorized.\\xa0 2,367 individuals voted and here are the results:  🔢\\xa02216 (96%) urged that I vote against reauthorizing FISA; 🔢\\xa095 (4%) asked that I vote to reauthorize FISA; 🔢\\xa010 (less than 1%) were undecided.  Thank you to everyone who responded to my poll!   Click here to read my press release further explaining why I voted against reauthorizing FISA.     Democrats Oppose Adding Citizenship Question to Census This week, the House Oversight and Accountability Committee on which I serve passed H.R. 7109, the Equal Representation Act, legislation to add a new question to the decennial census.\\xa0   ❓❓Congressman Gosar: what was the question, you might ask?\\xa0❓❓  Are you a citizen? YES\\xa0or NO.   Not surprisingly, every Democrat on the committee voted against this commonsense legislation.   Currently, the decennial census counts illegal aliens for purposes of reapportionment and allocating congressional seats. Thus, states that harbor illegal aliens will have their population numbers increased. With a population increase, those states may well get additional congressional seats in the House of Representatives and other states will lose seats.\\xa0 The surge of illegal aliens will generally benefit blue states and cause Congress to have an artificially high number of Democrat congressional districts.   Illegal immigration is a crime. Why are we awarding those who break our laws with Congressional representation?\\xa0 Because Democrats would rather have a wide-open southern border than a safe America. This is being done intentionally. It’s all about power.  Now that it has been voted out of committee, H.R. 7109, the Equal Representation Act, now goes to the House floor for a vote by every Member of Congress.\\xa0 I will be sure to keep you updated!    Congress Passes Bill Improving Access to Outdoor Recreation on Public Lands  Also this week, Congress passed H.R. 6492, the Expanding Public Lands Outdoor Recreation Experiences Act, or the EXPLORE Act. \\xa0The EXPLORE Act makes it easier for every American to enjoy our beautiful public lands and waters by promoting recreation opportunities for active service members and veterans, creating new long-distance bike trails, improving access for sportsmen and women, streamlining permitting for outfitters and guides, protecting rock climbing in iconic places, modernizing campgrounds, and much more. \\xa0Our nation is blessed with some of the most beautiful lands and waters in the world, it is only right that Congress makes them available for all Americans to enjoy.  🚴 🎣 🛶 🏃\\u200d♀️ 🧗 🏂 ⛺🌲   Congress Passes Legislation Long Championed by Gosar to Build Veterans Center in Gila County This week the House passed H.R. 1829, legislation I cosponsored with Representative Crane requiring the Secretary of Agriculture to convey the Pleasant Valley Ranger District Administrative Site to Gila County, Arizona.\\xa0 This bill would utilize 232 acres located in northern Arizona to build a veterans retreat and community center by transferring the Pleasant Valley Administrative Site and accompanying Forest Service land to Gila County.\\xa0 The community center will provide a gathering space for veterans and their families to host retreats, meetings, and other events. The area would also serve as a location for a mobile veterans’ clinic for veterans who cannot easily access a VA Medical Center.\\xa0  Completing this land transfer will open the door for new support services for veterans in northern Arizona.\\xa0 For years, I have long-championed this bipartisan cause and I am very pleased that this effort is gaining momentum. \\xa0   Gosar Hosts Successful Military Academy Day Thank you to all the High School Juniors, Seniors and parents who attended my Military Academy Day earlier this week to learn more about how to receive a congressional nomination to a\\xa0United States military service academy. \\xa0I am very impressed with the qualifications of the students and wish them all the best as they pursue an appointment.     It’s Mail Time! I’ve received a ton of mail each week and I appreciate hearing from everyone, including those who disagree.\\xa0 Here are samples of some of the letters sent in this week:  📨\\xa0Frank Z. from Prescott, AZ is a frequent critic who shared this incredibly intelligent comment this week 😂: MORON!!!!  👉\\xa0Frank, thanks for the very “thoughtful” remark.\\xa0 I will share with you the same advice I used to give my children: act your age, not your shoe size!\\xa0   📨\\xa0Robert M. from Goodyear, AZ writes✏: I am not in favor of the renewal of FISA and can’t believe Mike Johnson cast the deciding vote for it. We need to sharply curtail the power of the federal government to spy on US citizens since it’s clear that the government is incapable of keeping politics out of their decisions.  👉\\xa0Dear Robert, I won’t sugar-coat it: I too am in disbelief of the vote. As I noted above, there were several good amendments that would have reformed FISA, none more important than an amendment that, if passed, would have required a warrant to spy on Americans. \\xa0It failed, 212-212 was the final tally.\\xa0 In Congress, a tie means the vote fails.\\xa0 There are no tiebreakers.\\xa0 One additional vote was all that was needed, yet the Speaker voted with the UNIPARTY causing the amendment to fail.   📨\\xa0Cynthia W. from Kingman, AZ shares, in part, this note: Anyone harmed by the COVID vaccine should be allowed to be compensated by the manufacturer of the product. We must hold these companies responsible. Right now, Americans cannot sue a manufacturer or health provider if they or a family member are injured or killed by a COVID product. There have been well over one million claims of injury and death from COVID products reported. The COVID shot – in just over three years – racked up as many VAERS reports as all other vaccines combined since 1988. COVID products wouldn’t exist if manufacturers could be sued for harm.  The CDC continues to recommend COVID shots for our children, even though many countries, including Britain, France, Japan, Australia, and India, decided not to recommend boosters, or any shot at all for healthy children.

       " 'Press Release April 11, 2024 WASHINGTON, D.C.\\xa0—\\xa0U.S. Representative\\xa0David Schweikert (AZ-01)\\xa0authored\\xa0an op-ed for the\\xa0Phoenix Business Journal\\xa0yesterday to advocate for the proven pro-growth policies in the\\xa0Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act, bipartisan legislation that will provide much-needed relief to struggling families and small businesses, spur innovation and job creation, and invest in the future of all Arizonans. Rep. Schweikert called on the U.S. Senate to swiftly pass the bipartisan tax package\\xa0which passed the House with bipartisan support more than two months ago.\\xa0 My View:\\xa0Bipartisan tax package would help Arizona businesses growBy Congressman David SchweikertPhoenix Business JournalApril 10, 2024 Since first coming to Congress, my mission has been to help small businesses and families thrive in Arizona. As a staunch advocate for fiscal responsibility and economic prosperity, I’ve fought to foster a business environment where small businesses can succeed, innovation is incentivized, and workers and families are empowered.\\xa0Small businesses form the backbone of our local economy, making up over 92% of the shops and restaurants in Scottsdale. While traveling across the district, I frequently hear from business owners and listen to their concerns. Through my position on the House Committee on Ways and Means, which serves as Congress’s chief tax-writing committee, I enthusiastically work to advance meaningful tax policy that promotes economic growth and ensures prosperity for future generations.\\xa0Nearly seven years ago, I was proud to play an instrumental role in helping write the\\xa0Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), perhaps our nation’s most sweeping overhaul of the federal tax code in decades. In the first two years after TCJA, our country witnessed record-low unemployment, thousands of jobs created, and higher wages. This landmark legislation simultaneously lowered the tax burden for small businesses and American workers while encouraging innovation and competition to boost economic growth.\\xa0Building off the success of TCJA, my colleagues and I worked to provide small businesses and households with targeted, immediate relief through the\\xa0Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act. This bipartisan tax package, which passed the House by a vote of 357-70, would revive proven pro-growth policies like restoring full and immediate research and development expensing and 100% bonus depreciation. Modernization and productivity play critical roles in expanding the economy, and these two provisions promise to spur the next generation of economic disruptors and turbocharge investments in capital equipment and machinery.\\xa0R&D expensing can boost productivity, growth\\xa0Simply put, R&D expensing is an investment in our country’s economic future. Allowing businesses to deduct R&D expenditures ensures that money otherwise used for bearing the financial burdens of running a business can be reinvested into developing technology and innovative solutions that will enhance productivity, boost global competitiveness, and stimulate economic growth. This provision alone is estimated to generate over $70 billion in new R&D investment and support over 21 million American jobs while providing the government with more than an 8-to-1 return on its investment.\\xa0Similarly, the\\xa0Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act\\xa0extends the allowance of a 100% bonus deduction for capital equipment and assets, giving businesses the green light to streamline their operations, upgrade manufacturing equipment and heavy machinery, and embrace state-of-the-art innovations that drive productivity. This provision is estimated to increase investment by $400 billion and create 73,000 new jobs.\\xa0By providing small businesses with the resources and incentives they need to modernize and grow, we can unleash the full potential of the American economy and strengthen our nation’s economic resilience, competitiveness, and leadership on the global stage.\\xa0The\\xa0Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act\\xa0underscores the moral imperative of economic growth. As our economy expands, so does our revenue, and without growth, the government lacks a critical tool in restoring the fiscal sanity of the U.S. government.\\xa0\\xa0This bipartisan tax bill provides much-needed relief to struggling families and small businesses, spurs innovation and job creation, and paves the way for a brighter and more prosperous future for all Arizonans. Now, this tax package awaits its fate in the Senate, while every day that passes is a wasted opportunity to deliver for our communities in need.\\xa0Bipartisan victories are few and far between in this Congress. We have the chance to enact meaningful and impactful tax reform for hardworking Americans. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to seize this moment and act in the best interest of our nation’s economic future.

Schweikert’s floor speech can be found below: Click\\xa0here\\xa0or on the image above to view Rep.\\xa0Schweikert’s remarks.On foreign governments weaponizing AI to spread misinformation: [Beginning at 2:13]“We don’t actually understand it, but we have a war going on, and it’s a war for hearts and minds and there are bad actors around this world. The number of data points we have here showing particularly China, Russia, Iran, and it’s getting weaponized at a level I don’t think any of us are intellectually ready for because AI is here. The plain language is here, and they’re moving off of just your Facebook page or your social media accounts. It is moving into now fake text messages, all sorts of other ways where they’re going to try to pollute and take down the West. And we are not the only ones. We have map after map of what China just did to Taiwan. Now, Taiwan actually has built a policy on how to help combat it. They get attacked on social media with fake stuff. They have teams that turn around and say, ‘Okay, here’s what they said. Here’s the documents. Look it up yourself.’ I don’t think we are ready for this.“How do you and I and our brothers and sisters on the Left and anyone who actually cares about this country, how do you have honest debates, honest discussions about that? In my case, I am fearful of the crushing debt. We’re going to walk through that. But other policy things, when you actually lay out facts, you lay out the information of what’s going on, and 90 seconds later there is a bot that basically is putting out absolute crap. How do you hold a society together but you can’t even agree on the baseline facts to build the debate from when article after article\\xa0— some of these are huge. I brought the executive summaries. I mean, some of the ones we have gone through are hundreds of pages of tracking entire troll farms. There’s one document here saying that China may be spending multiple billions of dollars in influence operations here in this country to basically distort reality. And the point I’m going at right now, this seems like a weird place to go for a guy who wants to talk about the numbers of what’s happening in our government. I’m incredibly frustrated because I do not know how we have an honest debate when we have a disinformation wave coming at us from functionally governments, let alone the private troll farms that do it just for clickbait to make money.” On inflation’s impacts on the Phoenix-Scottsdale area: [Beginning at 21:31]“Why is the public so cranky? Seriously. I tried to have this conversation with folks at home, and I am blessed. I represent the Phoenix-Scottsdale area. If you have to represent a district, I represent one of the most beautiful spots, particularly in the winter months. I represent a fairly prosperous district. I represent a really well-educated district, a really entrepreneurial district. And yet a lot of my folks who if you see on the surface, they’re doing fairly well in life, and they’re stressed out of their minds because in my district, we have had the highest inflation in the continental United States. If you do not make 23.6% more money today than you did the day President Biden took office, you are poorer. So no matter what economic data this Body of Congress wants to talk about over and over and over. This is what matters when you actually look at the data of those who are non-supervisory or supervisory. Today they are poorer even when you put back in wage growth. Our brothers and sisters in America are poorer today, and in my district it’s worse. And I have a prosperous district. You want to understand why people are struggling and angry and frustrated. Maybe an honest conversation that we made them poorer.” On debt growth outpacing economic growth: [Beginning at 28:08]“But if you have someone who says we’ll just grow ourselves out of borrowing $100,000 a second, they are not good at math. Here’s the basic, simple rule. GDP — the size of the economy in 2023\\xa0—\\xa0grew $1.5 trillion. Yay. But you do understand for that growth, you only get 17-18%, maybe even 19% of that in tax receipts. So in the growth, that’s wonderful, but it is not dollar-for-dollar. And so I will get people and say, ‘Okay, you guys borrowed $2.5 trillion. But the economy grew $1.5 trillion.’ Yes, it did grow [by $1.5 trillion], but I only get 17-18-19% of that in tax receipts.\\xa0Do you understand the scale of growth you’d have to have for the tax receipts to come close to the borrowing?” Office Locations \\nWashington, DC Office\\n                    460 Cannon House Office Building\\n                    Washington, DC 20515\\n                    Phone: (202) 225-2190\\n                    Fax: (202) 225-0096\\n                     \\nScottsdale Office\\n                    14500 N.

The brutal and repressive regime in Tehran has continued its march toward destruction by arming radical proxies in the region, arming Putin’s war in Ukraine, and now directly attacking Israel. As I’ve said many times before, Iran will not stop developing missile and drone programs. Last year, the UN Security Council allowed sanctions on these very Iranian programs to expire. And we now find ourselves dealing with the consequences of lifting sanctions on a non-compliant regime. That is why I introduced the MISSILES Act, to ensure that the U.S. continues to limit Iran's ability to develop and proliferate their missile and drone technology. I am also calling on the UN Security Council to immediately reinstate sanctions on Iran at once. Make no mistake - our unwavering support for Israel’s security remains steadfast. Our work in building up the Arrow and David's Sling defense programs helped minimize the destructive potential Iran sought to inflict on the Israeli people.

       " 'FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEContact: Caroline Tabler or Patrick McCann (202) 224-2353April 15, 2024 Cotton to Biden: Investigate and Ban Temu Washington, D.C.\\xa0— Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) today sent a letter to President Joe Biden about the retail application Temu and its harmful practices, including gathering massive amounts of Americans’ personal data. Senator Cotton asked President Biden to address questions about the Chinese government’s control over the app, Temu’s violations of U.S. laws and regulations, and actions the administration can take against Temu. In part, Senator Cotton wrote: “As with TikTok and other invasive Chinese apps, Temu has no place in America. It’s a threat to American producers, investors, online retailers, and every single American’s personal privacy. I urge you to investigate Temu and to request the authorities necessary to protect Americans from this dangerous Chinese application.” Full text of the letter may be found here and below. April 15, 2024 President Joseph R. Biden? The White House,? 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW? Washington, DC 20500 Dear President Biden, I write to you regarding the urgent threat from the Chinese retail application, Temu. This malign app is a pipeline of dumped, counterfeit, and slave-labor products from China that is also gathering massive quantities of Americans’ personal data.  After launching in 2022, Temu has skyrocketed to one of the most downloaded apps in America and already rivals eBay for online sales. It has achieved this astronomical growth through billions of dollars of advertisements, including Super Bowl ads, and by undercutting competitors with extremely cheap and often counterfeit Chinese goods. Temu sells many of its products at a fraction of the price of its American competitors. Temu’s goods are cheap not because of fair competition, but rather because of China’s familiar combination of intellectual-property theft, government subsidies, and human-rights abuses. For example, Temu directly copies Amazon storefronts and then sells knock-off Chinese versions of the product at a deeply discounted rate. Temu also likely benefits from the use of slave labor. According to the House of Representatives Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, “American consumers should know that there is an extremely high risk that Temu’s supply chains are contaminated with forced labor.” Temu is getting away with this intellectual-property theft, unfair competition, and use of slave labor by flooding the American market with more than a million individual packages a week. Worse still, the company is importing these goods tax-free under the so-called de minimis loophole in such volumes that Customs and Border Protection simply can’t keep up.  Further, Temu is harvesting vast amounts of personal information from American consumers. In fact, Temu’s data gathering may be even more dangerous than TikTok’s and, according to one lawsuit, the app can access “everything on your phone.” Google Play also removed Temu’s parent company Pinduoduo’s (PDD) app as a result of harmful malware hidden in the app that gave it access to everything from biometrics to information about Wi-Fi networks.[x] This poses a grave threat to Americans’ privacy. PDD Holdings received more than $400 million in “income” from the PRC government last year, which suggests that PDD Holdings may be selling data collected on Temu to entities affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party. As with TikTok and other invasive Chinese apps, Temu has no place in America. It’s a threat to American producers, investors, online retailers, and every single American’s personal privacy. I urge you to investigate Temu and to request the authorities necessary to protect Americans from this dangerous Chinese application. I also urge you to end the de minimis loophole for China and other American adversaries.  Please provide answers to the following questions by May 10, 2024. Thank you for your attention to this important matter. ### nav-mobile-modal search-mobile-modal',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON, DC – In an effort to reduce gun violence and keep firearms out of the hands of criminals who shouldn’t have access to them, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is implementing improved background checks and tighter rules on the purchase of firearms.\\xa0 These tougher regulations are made possible by the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (P.L. 117-159), a federal gun safety package that U.S. Senator Jack Reed (D-RI) helped pass in 2022.\\xa0 Under the final rule – which was first proposed last August and underwent months of public comment and input – the definition of a licensed gun dealer is clarified to require anyone “engaged in the business” of selling guns at a profit – even in an informal setting like a flea market or trade show – to run routine background criminal and mental health checks to determine if a prospective buyer is legally prohibited from purchasing a firearm.\\xa0 “Closing the gun show loophole will help keep guns out of the hands of dangerous criminals.\\xa0 I was pleased to help pass this bipartisan law and commend President Biden for following through to increase the number of background checks performed.\\xa0 Congress should take the logical next step and pass universal background checks to better prevent firearms from falling into the wrong hands,” said Senator Reed. There are over 80,000 licensed gun dealers in America, according to the White House and DOJ estimates that there are over 20,000 unlicensed sellers who are selling firearms through online advertisements, gun shows, and other means. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) projects this new rule will apply to tens of thousands of unlicensed gun sales each year.\\xa0 The new rule is expected to take effect in 30 days. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act included multiple other provisions to reduce gun deaths and keep American communities safe, including Senator Reed’s bipartisan provision with Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) to support the effective implementation of state red flag laws.\\xa0 The law set aside $750 million to assist states in creating and administering ‘red flag’ laws and other measures that can keep guns out of the hands of those who are deemed to be an “extreme risk” threat to themselves or others.\\xa0 Reed also helped successfully include additional language in the law to bolster the 9-8-8 National Suicide Prevention Hotline and crack down on gun trafficking and straw purchases.',\n",

       " 'BISMARCK — On Thursday, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) announced its “Engaged in the Business” Final Rule, significantly expanding the criteria for who is considered a firearms dealer under federal law with profound implications for gun ownership. This costly, burdensome rule infringes on Second Amendment rights, while unlawfully expanding background check requirements and circumventing established exceptions for occasional firearm sellers. \\xa0 U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) issued the following statement regarding the Biden administration’s unconstitutional rule: “Instead of respecting the right to bear arms, the Biden administration’s overbearing rule unlawfully subjects occasional sellers to the same rules as large-scale, professional firearms dealers. This is an affront to the Second Amendment, a threat to individual liberties, and a manifestation of a broader agenda to disarm America. It needs to stop.” To justify its decision of the 466-page regulation, the Biden administration has relied on the\\xa0Bipartisan Safer Communities Act of 2022 (BSCA), which does not contain provisions allowing for the implementation of such an expansive redefinition of who is considered “engaged in the business” of selling firearms. Upon implementation, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) anticipates approximately 23,000 unlicensed firearms dealers will be affected by the administration’s latest regulation.

The Senators wrote in part, “We write to express concern regarding the allegations raised in a joint investigation by CBS’ 60 Minutes, Der Spiegel and the Insider which point to evidence that the Russian intelligence unit, GRU, is responsible for directed energy attacks against American government officials and their families. […] Despite our efforts to provide support to affected individuals and advance legislation to ensure that an interagency response was in place to get to the root cause behind these incidents, we are frustrated that this phenomenon is left unresolved and urge you to renew efforts to identify the cause behind directed energy attacks.”\\xa0 Senators Collins and Shaheen co-authored the HAVANA Act, which was signed into law in 2021.

       " ' For Immediate Release Congressman Jamaal Bowman Ed.D. (NY-16) released the following statement: In this critical moment, we need to engage with peace, not weapons. I unequivocally condemn the Iranian military’s attack on Israel, just as I condemn the Israeli military attack on the Iranian consulate in Syria ordered by Prime Minister Netanyahu that sparked this dangerous escalation. While there were no fatalities, shrapnel from an Iranian missile did severely injure Amina al-Hassouni, the seven-year old Bedouin girl, and I am praying for her swift recovery. I am deeply concerned by those demanding military reprisal. That is why I stand in support of President Biden’s immediate call to de-escalate this situation, and his actions to prevent the further spread of violence in the region. It is clearer than ever that Benjamin Netanyahu’s warmongering is putting the lives of millions of civilians at risk, including the Israeli people. It is why even as I condemned Hamas’ horrific attacks on October 7, I also called for immediate de-escalation and a ceasefire. We cannot condemn violence on one hand and then condone it in the other. The collective punishment leveled against the Palestinian people as well as Israeli military actions in Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, and Iraq have created a dangerous powder keg that threatens to become a regional war. Netanyahu is willing to endanger the lives of millions just to draw the US deeper into a conflict whose flame he fans. The path to peace starts with ensuring safety for people in the region. A majority of Americans want a permanent ceasefire, and support for Netanyahu in both the US and Israel shrinks by the day. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are starving to death in Gaza right now, including tens of thousands of children. Millions across the region fear being drawn into a bloody conflict orchestrated by madmen. Antisemitism and Islamophobia are on the rise in our very own country. We need de-escalation, restraint, a lasting ceasefire, and diplomacy. It is the only way forward, not just for Palestinians and Israelis, but us all.

       " 'WASHINGTON—House Committee on Oversight and Accountability Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.) today opened a hearing titled\\xa0“Oversight of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration”\\xa0to bring transparency to a pattern of issues within the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ensure the FDA is prioritizing safety and effectiveness and incentivizing innovation.  Below are Chairman Comer’s remarks as prepared for delivery. Welcome to the Committee on Oversight and Accountability. We thank Commissioner Califf for his participation in today’s oversight hearing of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. There might not be a federal agency that is more integral to Americans’ day-to-day lives than the FDA. FDA is charged with regulatory oversight of the food and drug industries. Industries that ensure Americans have food on the table by innovating safer and more stable crops. Industries that provide Americans new medications to treat debilitating diseases. Industries that create cutting-edge medical devices that can keep your heart pumping or help replace a knee. These industries are vital to keep Americans safe, healthy, and happy. These industries provide millions of jobs and nearly $3 trillion in economic value. Congress must ensure the FDA is prioritizing safety and effectiveness but also incentivizing innovation. Unfortunately, the FDA under President Biden is suffering from dysfunction and is failing to do the bare minimum to carry out its core mission—make certain our nation’s food and drug products are safe and effective. Further, the FDA appears consistently unprepared for crises.\\xa0\\xa0 That is why our Committee has conducted several investigations into areas of concern at the FDA. These investigations have identified a pattern of issues within the FDA. At the beginning of the Congress, Subcommittee Chairwoman McClain launched an investigation into the infant formula crisis. Her Subcommittee revealed how the FDA attempted to hide behind the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse for neglecting facility inspections and justifying poor performance. The FDA’s telework policies and lax approach to oversight left it unprepared to address the shortages when Abbott’s facility in Sturgis, Michigan was shut down. Additionally, the Biden White House and the FDA took\\xa0three months\\xa0to act to increase production of infant formula. The result of these failures? Barren shelves, leaving millions of young families unable to access the formula needed to feed their babies. We have also investigated the FDA’s failure to prepare for and adequately respond to drug shortages for essential medications used to treat infection, heart disease, and cancer, just to name a few examples. FDA and Democratic policies, such as the Inflation Reduction Act, have dramatically diminished the profitability of manufacturing generic medications. This has resulted in fewer manufacturers and a greater risk of shortage. The FDA must improve coordination with manufacturers and federal agencies, including DEA, DOJ, and DOD to increase production. The FDA has failed to incentivize domestic manufacturing of pharmaceuticals resulting in significant off-shoring of these facilities. We conducted oversight of the FDA’s failure to return to pre-pandemic levels of inspections of those manufacturing facilities for prescription drugs abroad. Inspections of foreign manufacturing facilities were 79 percent lower in 2022 than 2019. Last year alone, this failure resulted in two separate recalls of eye drops manufactured in India that caused an outbreak of dangerous drug-resistant bacteria killing four people. Through our investigation of tobacco products regulations, we learned the FDA is failing to consistently and effectively regulate tobacco products. According to the Reagan-Udall Foundation, the FDA has been “reactive and overwhelmed” in its tobacco products regulation. The FDA has delayed review of applications for products that can reduce harm for many Americans. Further, the FDA’s failure to regulate has allowed unsafe and illicit products to proliferate. In fact, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit slammed the FDA for “[sending] manufacturers of flavored e-cigarette products on a wild goose chase.” Meanwhile, the FDA is also failing to prevent illicit flavored tobacco products from China entering the country and harming Americans. The FDA is not implementing enforcement actions to address illicit flavored tobacco products in stores across the country. Additionally, the Committee examined the FDA’s refusal to regulate hemp-derived products such as CBD. Instead of using its existing authorities, the FDA is requesting new authorities and money that it does not need. This is the FDA putting its own bureaucratic priorities over the American people who can benefit from these products. The FDA’s refusal to regulate hemp products is creating significant confusion in the market and resulting in products with intoxicants that may be dangerous to Americans who use these products. It has also halted businesses trying—in good faith—to enter the market, while bad actors continue to thrive. Finally, we have found that the FDA ignored decades of research regarding the ineffectiveness of an over-the-counter decongestant causing Americans to waste their hard-earned money on a medication that is simply ineffective. These examples are just scratching the surface of the dysfunction and failures that are ongoing within the FDA. Today I’m hopeful we can take a deep dive to better understand how the FDA is responding and taking action to ensure a safe food and drug supply. I now yield to the Ranking Member.

       " 'Washington, D.C.- In case you missed it, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik published an op-ed in Real Clear Defense highlighting the need for the Department of Defense to better identify organizations that embrace innovation and enable them to transition technology to the warfighter highlighting Future Flag’s model of experimentation and active risk reduction. The Joint Future Flag Experiment led by Air Force Research Lab-Rome offers an opportunity for the Department of Defense to experiment, test, and evaluate emerging technologies in the town of Lewis in Essex County, New York. Read the full article below. Real Clear Defense: The Air Force’s Future Flag Experiment Is A Success By Rep. Elise Stefanik New York’s 21st Congressional District has a long and distinguished history of playing a critical role in U.S. national security. From the renowned Battles of Saratoga that turned the tide of the Revolutionary War to the work of Strategic Air Command’s missileers at Plattsburgh Air Force Base during the Cold War, to today’s continued service of the 10th Mountain Division at Fort Drum, the region’s history of service and innovation is ingrained in Upstate New York and North Country culture. In today’s global climate of competition and instability, the innovative ecosystem in NY-21 is more critical than ever.\\xa0 Carrying on the region’s tradition of service and conducted annually in Lewis, New York, the Joint Future Flag Experiment led by Air Force Research Lab-Rome (AFRL-Rome) offers a unique opportunity for the Department of Defense (DoD) to experiment, test, and evaluate emerging technologies while they are in the hands of operators. Designed as a joint operational and laboratory effort, Future Flag brings together operational personnel, research and development teams, and government and industry, to enable rapid design, solution development, and prototyping. Future Flag cuts through the bureaucracy to effectively integrate technology for the warfighter at the speed of relevance in today’s ever-changing world without the typical constraints found in the DoD. The key to this effort is the objective experimentation’s focus on collaboration across multiple communities with direct and unfiltered exchange of ideas and concepts. Seldom do operators, developers, and engineers have a chance to work together in small unit level operational settings. Future Flag offers the opportunity to reduce risk, focus limited resources, and provide the warfighter with new and unique capabilities targeting their actual needs, not poorly conceived and out-of-date requirements. Future Flag’s results are sent forward into large scale exercises like Northern Edge, or into Combatant Commands (COCOMs) where they are directly impacting current operations. Future Flag creates a process where industry can iterate and develop technologies unconstrained by conventional doctrine. The goal of developing new technologies is to provide new capabilities, which in turn require new doctrine. Unlike traditional approaches to development that allow for only slow evolution of doctrine to exploit new and emerging capabilities, Future Flag starts by throwing out conventional doctrinal constraints, allowing the operators and engineers to push their limits and test the art of the possible to rapidly provide vital capabilities to the warfighter. The Future Flag series is already yielding critical results that are contributing to strategic deterrence in the Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM). The Air Force’s Air Combat Command worked with the Future Flag team to rapidly experiment with edge computing for the MQ-9 Reaper’s M2DO (Multi Domain) configuration in Lewis, NY. These experiments directly resulted in enhancing the MQ-9 platform with critical command and control and electro-optical/infra-red sensing capabilities, significantly increasing the Air Force’s ability to conduct unmanned-Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance missions in INDOPACOM. It is critical that we continue to provide our service members with resources to conduct these vital missions. Following my advocacy, the final FY 2024 defense appropriations bill included $25 million for Air Force Research Laboratory-Rome to expand the scope of Future Flag. In keeping with my commitment to provide our warfighters with the very best capabilities, Future Flag represents one of the earliest and most effective forays into the arena of contractor owned, contractor operated large scale operational laboratories in the nation. The DoD must better identify organizations and activities that embrace innovation, like Future Flag, and enable them to transition technology to the warfighter. To truly innovate and get capabilities to the warfighter at relevant speed and scale, DoD must scale Future Flag’s innovative model of aggressive experimentation and active risk reduction. The DoD’s repeated failure to appropriately manage risk in pursuit of innovation only shifts the risk to the operational community. Future Flag must be the standard in testing, evaluation, and experimentation, not the exception. The stakes are too high to fail at placing anything but the best capabilities in the hands of the warfighter.\\xa0 Permalink: https://stefanik.house.gov/2024/4/icymi-stefanik-oped-in-real-clear-defense-the-air-force-s-future-flag-experiment-is-a-success 2211 Rayburn House Office Building Washington, DC 20515 Phone: (202) 225-4611 137 Margaret Street, Suite 100 Plattsburgh, NY 12901 Phone: (518) 561-2324 Fax: (518) 561-2408 330 Ford Street, Suite B8 Ogdensburg, NY 13669 Phone: (315) 541-2670 99 Troy Road, Suite 312 East Greenbush, NY 12061 Phone: (518) 242-4707 Phone: (315) 219-8005',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) sent a letter to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra urging him to fully implement Jessie’s Law. This bipartisan legislation helps ensure best practices are in place so physicians and other medical professionals have knowledge of a patient’s history with substance use disorder when determining appropriate medical care. Jessie’s Law was included in the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention That Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act, which was signed into law by President Donald Trump in 2018. Since then, HHS has partially responded to this directive; however, it has not released guidance for including a patient’s history of substance use disorder in their electronic health record. In February of this year, HHS finalized the Confidentiality of Substance Use Disorder (SUD) Patient Records rule, which aligns the law governing privacy records for patients with substance use disorder with other health privacy laws. As this rule is now finalized, it is past time to fully implement Jessie’s Law. “In March 2016, we lost a young woman with great potential named Jessica Grubb,” the senators wrote in part. “Her death was tragic, but preventable… As you know, both Jessie’s Law and the Legacy Act were enacted to reduce the burdens associated with accessing treatment and to improve care coordination, while protecting patient privacy in order to ensure we are addressing the drug epidemic to our fullest potential… We look forward to hearing from you on your plans to fully implement the law.” Jessie’s Law is named after Jessica Grubb, a West Virginian who died from substance use disorder after a medical provider prescribed her opioid pills following a surgery. After battling substance use disorder for seven years, Jessie was sober and focused on making a life for herself in Michigan. She was training to run in a marathon and had to undergo surgery for a running related injury. Her parents told her doctors and hospital personnel that she was recovering from substance use disorder; however, after Jessie’s surgery, the discharging doctor, who said he didn’t know she was recovering from substance use disorder, sent her home with a prescription for 50 oxycodone pills. This legislation requires HHS to develop and disseminate standards for hospitals and medical professionals to effectively display a patient’s past history of opioid use disorder when the patient provides that information. The full text of the legislation is available here. The full letter is available below or here. Dear Secretary Becerra, In March 2016, we lost a young woman with great potential named Jessica Grubb. Jessie was a great student, a loving daughter and sister, and an avid runner. She was also recovering from an opioid use disorder. When she had surgery for an infection related to a running injury, her parents were there to take care of her and both Jessie and her parents told her doctors and hospital personnel that she was in recovery and was not to be prescribed opioids. Unfortunately, Jessie’s discharging physician missed this note in her medical record and sent her home with a prescription for 50 oxycodone pills. Her parents talked to her on the phone when she got home, but that was the last time. She passed away that night in her sleep. The temptation was too great for her, as it would be for so many in recovery. Her death was tragic, but preventable. Jessie’s story inspired us to act to save lives and prevent families like Jessie’s from feeling that grief. We introduced Jessie’s Law, a simple bill to honor Jessie that would require the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop and disseminate standards for hospitals and medical professionals to effectively display a patient’s past history of opioid use disorder when the patient provides that information. This will help ensure that medical professionals are able to take this into account when working to provide medically appropriate care just as they would any allergy or other life-threatening condition. Jessie’s Law was included in the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, which was signed into law by President Trump on October 24, 2018. Since then, HHS Office of Civil Rights (OCR) has partially responded to this directive, however it has not released best practices for including a patient’s history of opioid use disorder in their electronic health record. In February of this year, HHS finalized the Confidentiality of Substance Use Disorder (SUD) Patient Records rule, which better aligns the rule governing privacy records for patients with substance use disorder, known as 42 CFR Part 2 (Part 2) with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Previously there had been concern with best practices and how to address Part 2 confidentiality, however with this rule being finalized, we feel that it is now past time to fully implement Jessie’s Law. Since the passage of SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, the COVID-19 pandemic helped exacerbate the substance use crisis in the United States. According to recently published data, drug overdose deaths reached record levels in 2021; totaling nearly 107,000 people and reversing the progress that was made as recently as 2019.\\xa0As you know, both Jessie’s Law and the Legacy Act were enacted to reduce the burdens associated with accessing treatment, and to improve care coordination, while protecting patient privacy, in order to ensure we are addressing the drug epidemic to our fullest potential. We appreciated HHS fully implementing the Legacy Act and look forward to securing Jessie’s legacy by fully implementing Jessie’s Law, to ensure a tragedy like Jessie’s never happens again.

This bipartisan legislation enhances prevention measures for blast overpressure and supports life-saving treatment for TBIs and other brain injuries.”\\xa0 “Brain health plays a crucial role in many veterans’ overall quality of life. Head-related trauma, including traumatic brain injury (TBI), is sometimes referred to as the ‘signature injury’ for post-9/11 veterans due to the increased TBI prevalence among veterans of this generation.

       " 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) released the following statement today regarding the latest strikes by Iran: “In the face of Iran’s significant military strikes on Israel, the United States must stand with our ally as Israel’s national unity government takes necessary measures to defend its people and its sovereignty. “President Biden has insisted that America’s commitment to Israel’s security is ‘ironclad’. It is time for his Administration to match words with actions. President Biden must lead an international effort to impose sufficient costs on Tehran to compel an end to its aggression and terror, both on Israeli soil and — as demonstrated with today’s IRGC assault on a commercial shipping vessel — around the region. Iran’s leaders must know the things they value most are at risk.\\xa0 “The President must also give Israel the time, space, and support it deserves to finish the job against Hamas. Tehran and its proxies are emboldened when they see divisions between the US and Israel. “Congress must also do its part. The national security supplemental that has waited months for action will provide critical resources to Israel and our own military forces in the region. It will provide overdue lethal assistance to Ukraine and equip vulnerable allies and partners in Asia to deter the PRC. And it will make urgent investments in our own defense industrial base. “We cannot hope to deter conflict without demonstrating resolve and investing seriously in American strength. The Commander-in-Chief and the Congress must discharge our fundamental duties without delay. The consequences of failure are clear, devastating, and avoidable.” ###',\n",

Bethel is rural, but we have more than 80 unhoused family members and neighbors here. The permanent supportive housing project is supposed to have case management services and 24-hour staff on site to ensure the safety of tenants.

This appropriation will ensure we can provide additional services to both Bethel Winter House guests and PSH tenants that are critically needed and have largely been unfunded in our community. This appropriation will help us provide life-saving services. It comes at a time when we are serving more people than ever and expanding to providing permanent housing for the chronically unhoused. We could not be more thankful,” – Jaela Milford, Bethel Winter House Executive Director Kotzebue: $750,000 for the Maniilaq Association to establish a 24/7 crisis stabilization center. “Maniilaq Association would like to express a sincere appreciation for Senator Murkowski and her staff's efforts in securing an appropriation for the establishment of a Behavioral Health Crisis Stabilization Center. Her dedication to addressing mental health challenges in Northwest Alaska is evident, and we certainly join her in this effort. This project will undoubtedly make a significant difference in our communities, and will impact generations to come. Once again, our gratitude for her support in this effort cannot be overstated.” –\\xa0 Bree Swanson, Social Services Administrator at Maniilaq Association North Slope Region: $1 million for the Arctic Slope Community Foundation to develop and provide a local indigenous educator apprenticeship model. “On behalf of the Arctic Slope Community Foundation, we would like to thank Senator Murkowski for your advocacy and steadfast support for our educator training program. Working as innovators in rural Alaska, we know the importance of having well-qualified Alaska Native educators serving in village schools. The Aullaagvik 2.1 Tribal Educator Apprenticeship was recently accepted by the U.S. Department of Labor, and we are preparing to enroll the first cohort in 2024.” –\\xa0 Patuk Glenn, Executive Director at the Arctic Slope Community Foundation  Anchorage: $1 million for the Southcentral Foundation to construct and purchase equipment for a new Crisis Stabilization Center. “Southcentral Foundation extends its thanks to Senator Lisa Murkowski for her efforts in securing crucial funding for rural health care workforce housing and equipment. Ensuring access to quality care is key to keeping Alaskans healthy.\\xa0 Being able to offer provider housing will allow us to attract additional health care professionals to work in some of the most amazing communities in Alaska.” – April Kyle, President/CEO, Southcentral Foundation  Cordova: $5 million for the Native Village of Eyak to construct a primary care clinic and renovate a health care facility. “We were extremely thrilled to learn Friday that we are one of several Tribes in Alaska to benefit from Senator Murkowski’s FY2024 Congressional Designated Spending appropriation this year. Our Tribal Council has been engaged in discussion with the City of Cordova and other stakeholders for the past three years on how best to improve health services for our growing community. Our CDS application was one of over 300 requests which allows for the funding of locally prioritized projects within the State. This will bring us closer to realizing our dream for a new modernized health system for all our residents.” - Brooke Mallory, Chairwoman of Native Village of Eyak (NVE) “We appreciate that Senator Murkowski visited with us last Summer and saw firsthand the very real challenges we are facing with our aging healthcare facilities and how this impacts our ability to provide safe, quality care.

       " 'U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) today applauded the USDA Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) for including Alaska salmon into more Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) food packages. Murkowski has advocated for expanded inclusion of healthy, nutritious Alaskan salmon in WIC food packages since 2014, when the process to update WIC food packages began. “It is great news for America’s mothers and their children who rely on WIC that the USDA is including low-mercury seafood like Alaska salmon in more WIC food packages. Alaska’s wild salmon is among the healthiest and most nutritious food in the world and I’m grateful for Alaska’s fishermen and the seafood industry who help provide it to consumers. I’ve long worked on this issue because Alaskan seafood should be accessible to America’s children and mothers in our food programs. Today’s announcement is good news and I am proud to have championed this effort that both supports Alaska’s seafood industry and the health of America’s kids and moms,” Senator Lisa Murkowski said. Background: WIC provides supplemental nutrition based on the individual needs of mothers and their young children. By law, USDA must “conduct a comprehensive scientific review of the WIC food packages at least every ten years and update them, as needed, to reflect nutrition science, public health concerns, and cultural eating patterns.” USDA has relied on the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine to make scientific recommendations. FNS then considered those recommendations and released a proposed rule for public comment.\\xa0 Following public comment, the final rule was released.\\xa0 Senator Murkowski has long advocated for the inclusion of low-mercury fish—like Alaska salmon—to be included in more WIC food packages. She specifically advocated for children ages 1 – 4, and pregnant and partially breastfeeding mothers to have expanded access to Alaska salmon food products. Senator’s Murkowski advocacy led to the following regulatory changes: Food Packages Old Regulations 2022 Proposed Regulation 2024 Final Regulation Children Ages 1 to 4 No Fish 5 oz. for 2-4-year olds; 6 oz. for 1-4-year olds Women Pregnant and Partially Breastfeeding No Fish 10 oz for Pregnant;\\xa0\\xa0 15 oz for Partially Breastfeeding; 10 oz. for Pregnant;\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 15 oz for Partially Breastfeeding Post-Partum No Fish 10 ounces per month 10 oz.\\xa0 Timeline:  Senator Murkowski began to include appropriations report language in the Agriculture, FDA, Rural Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations committee reports in Fiscal Year 2016 to encourage the National Academies to recommend that USDA allow more low-mercury fish—including wild salmon—in more WIC food packages, given the science that low-mercury fish is good for both adults and children.\\xa0 Once the National Academies’ recommendations to include more low-mercury fish in more food packages, Senator Murkowski began to encourage USDA to adopt those recommendations in their regulations. 510 L Street\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSuite 600\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAnchorage, AK  99501\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPhone: (907) 271-3735\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFax: (877) 857-0322 800 Glacier Ave\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSuite 101\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJuneau, AK  99801\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPhone: (907) 586-7277\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFax: (877) 857-0322 851 E.

This is an alarming escalation. Now more than ever, it is critical for us to stand by our friend and ally. As President Biden has made clear: \"Our support for Israel’s security is ironclad.

I condemn these attacks, which threaten civilian lives and regional war. I also condemn the calls by Members of Congress and others to initiate war with Iran; to do so without Congressional authorization is blatantly unconstitutional. I’m encouraged by reporting that President Biden advised Prime Minister Netanyahu last night that the U.S. will oppose any Israeli counter-attacks against Iran, and I urge the President to continue to take immediate steps, including at the UN Security Council and G7, to de-escalate and facilitate an immediate, lasting ceasefire in the region.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 “Since the horrific October 7 attack, I have repeatedly urged an end to the violence through de-escalation, ceasefire, and diplomacy and cautioned that war is never the answer. Instead, the U.S. government has shamefully and unconditionally armed the Israeli government as it has committed war crimes, killed over 33,000 Palestinians, inflicted famine in Gaza, violated domestic and international laws, and increased the chances of regional war. This failed approach must end.\\xa0 “The people of our country do not want war. They want to live in a world that is safe, peaceful, and just. That is why our pro-peace, pro-humanity movement is stronger than ever, and it’s why, as recently as last week, dozens of my colleagues and I called for our government to stop arming Netanyahu’s maniacal, genocidal acts. We are pushing for the safety of all people, from Palestinians and Israelis abroad to Jewish, Arab, Muslim, and other communities who are being targeted here at home, to the release of all hostages and those arbitrarily detained, and ending the risk of a regional war that further entangles the United States and jeopardizes the safety of our people. We cannot let the warmongers win; our country and our world are calling for restraint, de-escalation, a lasting ceasefire, and diplomacy. Our government must listen. That is how we save lives.” On April 1, 2024, the Israeli government bombed an Iranian embassy complex in Damascus, Syria, killing 16 people. In retaliation, the Iranian military launched an attack on Israel using drones and missiles on April 13. Since October 7, 2023, over 33,000 Palestinians and 1,100 Israelis have been killed, 76,000 Palestinians have been injured, dozens of hostages have been killed, and over 100 Israelis and thousands of Palestinians remain unlawfully detained.\\xa0 ###',\n",
       " 'Today, Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman (NJ-12) introduced the Gig Is Up Act, which would push companies to treat gig workers fairly.\\xa0 The bill would require companies with at least $100 million in revenues, and that employ at least 10,000 independent contractors, to pay for both the employer’s and the worker’s payroll tax contributions to Social Security and Medicare. Under the current system, the gig worker must pay for both. This new requirement for large companies would create an incentive to accurately classify these workers as employees, instead of forcing workers to shoulder the entire burden. “These people work hard. They generate millions of dollars in value for large tech companies, but they’ve been denied the basic benefits afforded to traditional employees,” said Rep. Watson Coleman. “Wealthy corporations have abused the system and these workers, who often struggle to support their families. ‘Honest work for fair pay.’ That’s the deal. This legislation ensures corporations hold up their end of the bargain.” “It\\'s shameful that companies continue to misclassify their workers to avoid providing them with essential benefits,” said Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib (MI-12) “We must close the legal loopholes that allow massive companies to continue these exploitative practices. That\\'s why I\\'m so proud to join Congresswoman Watson Coleman in support of this critical legislation.” “For too long, large companies and multinational corporations have taken advantage of workers based on their classification as independent contractors,\" said Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky (IL-09). \"Today we say the gig is up! I am proud to join my friend and colleague Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman in introducing the Gig Is Up Act to ensure that companies prioritize people over profits by paying workers fair compensation and providing the benefits that they have earned.\" \"Every employee in this country deserves a living wage and sufficient benefits for themselves and their families,” said Rep. Shri Thanedar (MI-13). “Currently, millions of gig workers like ride-share drivers, food delivery workers, and more are being taken advantage of by their corporate employers. By finally forcing billionaire CEOs to pay their fair share, every worker can get what they deserve!\" \"Big companies like Uber and Lyft keep profits to themselves by misclassifying their workers, shirking all responsibility for benefits and decent wages in favor of precarious gig work,” said AFT President Randi Weingarten. “This is a targeted and malicious practice that leaves workers shouldering what should be a large corporation’s obligation to contribute their share of payroll taxes to Social Security and Medicare. The Gig Is Up Act confronts this injustice by pushing these companies to treat their workers as employees, with all the rights and respect that affords them. American families can’t build a decent life by cobbling together gig work — it’s time for big employers to pay their fair share.\" “NEA is proud to endorse the Gig Is Up Act which would rightfully place the responsibility for payroll taxes on the multimillion dollar corporations not their gig workers. It’s unconscionable that the gig workers who have made these companies successful are responsible for paying the corporation’s share of payroll taxes,” said Marc Egan, Director of Government Relations at the National Education Association. “It’s time for these corporations to step up and treat their workers who are essential to their existence with respect.” \"Social Security Works is proud to support the Gig Is Up Act. This legislation takes much-needed steps to hold corporations accountable for exploiting their workers by misclassifying them as independent contractors,” said Executive Director Alex Lawson. “By requiring these corporations to pay their fair share into Social Security and Medicare, the Gig Is Up Act ensures that workers will receive their earned benefits. Thank you Rep. Watson Coleman for fighting for working people!\" “Large tech corporations like Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash have been chasing profit by paying dangerously low wages, denying people a meaningful voice in their working conditions, and shirking their responsibility for paying into social insurance funds that contribute to the safety and well-being of the working people they depend upon— workers who are disproportionately immigrants and people of color,” said Laura Padin, Director of Work Structures at National Employment Law Project (NELP). “NELP applauds Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman for reintroducing the Gig Is Up Act and requiring large corporations to contribute to Social Security and Medicare for the working people who are essential to their businesses.” “Congress should pass the Gig Is Up Act to ensure Medicare and Social Security benefits are adequately funded by large employers who retain gig economy workers,” said Trudy Goldberg, chair of the National Jobs for All Network. “It’s shocking and unacceptable that large companies are currently allowed to misclassify workers and evade their ethical responsibility to provide the adequate retirement and medical benefits that all workers deserve.” The Gig Is up Act is cosponsored by Representatives Eleanor Holmes Norton (DC-At Large), Rashida Tlaib (MI-12), André Carson (IN-07), Jan Schakowsky (IL-09), Jamaal Bowman (NY-16), Shri Thanedar (MI-13), Jahana Hayes (CT-05), Barbara Lee (CA-12), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (NY-14), Summer Lee (PA-12), Delia Ramirez (IL-03), and Robert Menendez, Jr. (NJ-08).

       " 'Washington, D.C. – Today, Rep. Mike Levin (CA-49) released the following statement calling on House Speaker Mike Johnson to immediately bring H.R. 529, the Extending Limits of U.S. Customs Waters Act, to the House floor for a vote. Last year, Rep. Levin met with CBP’s Air and Marine Operations (AMO) to learn about agents’ work to secure our maritime borders and hear directly about how he can support that work. During the discussion, AMO agents highlighted the importance of extending U.S. customs waters and shared how it will help them carry out their mission. “Recent incidents of unidentified vessels landing onshore in our district have underscored the urgency of bringing H.R. 529 to the House floor for a vote. This bill would double the range in which Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents can operate to address migrants and other vessels arriving by water along our coast. It would extend U.S. customs waters from 12 to 24 nautical miles, providing CBP with additional support to accomplish its duties, including interdicting drugs and addressing issues with migration, effectively and efficiently. “Last month, I voted in favor of a government funding package that will increase resources to CBP and provide the agency with updated tools and enforcement mechanisms, but there’s still more we must do to address our broken immigration system and support law enforcement officials. “Last week, Speaker Johnson was unable to bring H.R. 529 to the House floor as originally planned because of chaos within the House Republican Conference. He needs to stop playing games and Republican politicians need to stop with the political theater. If Speaker Johnson and the Republican Party care about solving our immigration crisis, stopping the flow of illegal fentanyl, and securing our borders like they claim, then they must bring this bill to the floor immediately. We need bipartisan, pragmatic solutions. This is one of them. I look forward to voting in favor of this bill.” ###',\n",
       " '\\xa0 [WASHINGTON, DC] – Today, U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) met with diaper bank leaders and advocates—including members of the National Diaper Bank Network and Cradles to Crayons Founder & CEO Lynn Margherio—to discuss her efforts to help make it easier for low-income families to afford the diapers that they need for their children. In her meetings, Duckworth highlighted that she was able to successfully secure $20 million in the final fiscal year (FY) 2024 appropriations package—building on the $20 million she secured in FY 2023 and the $10 million in the\\xa0FY 2022 appropriations package—dedicated to expanding diaper distribution programs. Building on this progress, the Senator also underscored the need to pass her bipartisan End Diaper Need Act which would help assist low-income families to address diaper need by providing targeted funding for states, territories and other eligible entities working on this issue. Photos of Senator Duckworth’s meetings can be found on the Senator’s website. “Between putting food on the table and paying the bills, the last thing working parents should have to worry about is whether they can afford something as basic as the diapers their families need,” said Duckworth. “After working for years to secure major funding that is supporting our nation’s diaper banks, there is still more work to do to help people most in need. Today, leaders of the National Diaper Bank Network and Cradles to Crayons and I agreed: Congress must pass my bipartisan legislation so we can help end diaper need for all families.” Diapers are not only critical for those who wear them; they’re also essential for the economic and emotional health of a family as a whole. However, in this country, according to a recent survey by the National Diaper Bank Network, nearly half of families have reported not having enough diapers, and more than a quarter of respondents who reported diaper need said that they skipped meals to pay for more diapers. -30-  ',\n",
       " '\\xa0 [WASHINGTON, D.C.] – Today, U.S. Senators Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV)—both members of the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation (CST)—introduced bipartisan legislation to help break down unnecessary barriers that Americans with disabilities continue to experience at Amtrak rail stations across the country. Building on Duckworth’s All Stations Accessibility Program (ASAP) Act, which became law as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and is helping improve transportation accessibility nationwide, the bipartisan Think DIFFERENTLY Transportation Act would help bring Amtrak stations up to standards enshrined in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by requiring the rail agency to submit annual reports to Congress on the status of its compliance with accessibility standards set by the ADA. “When the ADA was signed into law, it enshrined the promise that intercity passenger rail would become accessible within 20 years—and yet, more than 30 years later, too many Amtrak stations fail to live up to that promise,” said Senator Duckworth. “To build on the progress that my ASAP Act in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is already making, I’m proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation with Senator Capito to help ensure Amtrak does more to improve accessibility across its rail stations, too. Whether they’d like to travel by transit, rail or plane, all Americans with disabilities should be able to safely and easily access the transportation systems they need to get around—and I won’t stop working until that’s a reality.” “In the fall, my hometown of Charleston unveiled its upgrades that made the station compliant with Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) standards thanks to over $6 million from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that I helped craft. However, there are still stations across the country where train transportation is not accessible for everyone. I’m pleased to join Senator Duckworth in introducing this legislation that will hold Amtrak stations accountable to being accessible to disabled passengers,” said Senator Capito. Amtrak serves over 28 million riders per year. However, despite the ADA requiring intercity passenger rail to become accessible within a 20-year time frame, that is not yet the case across Amtrak stations. From 2017 to 2021, Amtrak received $275 million in federal funds to continue making accessibility upgrades and will continue to receive federal funding to do so through 2025 as a result of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. As of July 2023, Amtrak has only made 30% of its 385 stations accessible to those with disabilities. The legislation is supported by the National Disability Rights Network. This legislation is an identical companion bill to Representative Marc Molinaro’s bipartisan H.R. 6248, which passed the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure via voice vote on January 31, 2024. The bill was originally cosponsored by U.S. Reps. Donald Payne Jr. (D-NJ-10), Troy Nehls (R-TX-22), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC-At Large), Jenniffer Gonzales-Colon (R-PR), Chris Pappas (D-NH-1)\\xa0and\\xa0Andre Carson (D-IN-7). A copy of the bill text is available on the Senator’s website. Duckworth has long advocated that Americans with disabilities should receive the dignity and respect they deserve while traveling. Duckworth authored the\\xa0ASAP Act\\xa0provisions\\xa0in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which provide $1.75 billion over the next five years to help build ramps, install elevators and make other improvements to help ensure our nation’s transit systems are actually, finally usable for those with disabilities. As Chair of the CST Subcommittee on Aviation Safety, Operations and Innovation and one of the authors of the bipartisan\\xa0FAA Reauthorization Act of 2023\\xa0that passed through the CST committee, Duckworth successfully secured several provisions that will improve safety for consumers and enhance protections for travelers with disabilities in our aviation system. Additionally, as a\\xa0result\\xa0of legislation that was written by Duckworth, the Department of Transportation\\xa0implemented\\xa0a rule requiring air carriers to disclose for the first time how many checked bags, wheelchairs and motorized scooters they damage or mishandle each month.\\xa0 -30-  ',\n",

In last month’s government funding bills, Duckworth secured $300,000 in Congressionally Directed Spending (CDS) for RPS to fund its initiative with RU for high school students interested in pursuing a career in education to transition to a teacher prep program through the university. And earlier this week, the U.S. Department of Labor announced RVC will receive $5,585,017 in federal support to expand access to training and skills in high demand industries such as automotive, aviation and STEM related fields. Photos from today’s meeting are available on the Senator’s website. “Our state and our nation are stronger when we invest in our communities and families—and that’s one of the things Congressionally Directed Spending allows us to do,” Duckworth said. “It was great to meet with Rockford’s education leaders today to learn more about how this funding will support the next generation of educators and talk about how we can continue to work together across all levels of government to bring more funding back to the region and support important education and training programs.” Duckworth today met with RPS Superintendent Dr. Ehren Jarrett, Director of Recruitment Jason Pope and Chief DEI Officer Dr. Antoine Reed, as well as RU Director of Graduate Studies Kelly Monson and RVC President Dr. Howard Spearman.

       " '\\xa0 [ROCKFORD, IL] – U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) today met with Rockford government and labor leaders to discuss a proposed waste-to-energy facility in Rockford. This meeting follows Duckworth’s official visit to Sweden and The Netherlands earlier this year where she met with industry and government leaders who are pioneering clean waste-to-energy technology, learning more about this technology and how it can be replicated in Illinois. As a member of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, one of Duckworth’s top priorities has been advocating for Illinois with our allies and partners abroad, with her most recent official visit focused on bringing green energy best-practices and investments back to our state to help create good-paying green jobs while improving environmental justice, reducing waste, expanding energy supplies and helping strengthen businesses. Photos from today’s meeting are available on the Senator’s website. “The Netherlands and Sweden have a lot to teach the world about recycling, waste management, emissions and energy production, and I was able to see firsthand earlier this year some of the innovation and practices their organizations are helping pioneer,” Duckworth said. “Illinois is a world leader in renewable energy and biofuels, and I’m committed to working to bring more innovative technologies and green energy projects back home. I’m going to keep doing what I can to push for more investments like this that help provide cleaner, lower-cost energy alternatives while shielding our most disadvantaged communities from the devastating impacts of our climate crisis and from harmful emissions and waste.” During her February trip to Sweden and The Netherlands, she toured sites and met with senior officials from multiple waste management, recycling and energy businesses to learn more about the technologies and practices they are developing that could help tackle the climate crisis. As the climate crisis, landfill waste, emissions and plastic pollution continue to disproportionately impact low-income and communities of color, Duckworth is committed to finding innovative solutions to help the United States with their clean energy transition, curbing climate change as well as building on her work supporting environmental justice communities and shifting our country away from fossil fuels. Illinois is a diverse energy state and is a net energy exporter, ranked first among all Midwest states in cleaner energy capacity. Illinois is the nation’s largest producer of nuclear energy and fifth in the nation for wind energy capacity. Illinois is also one of the largest producers of biofuels and biofuels feedstock, which includes Sustainable Aviation Fuel. Duckworth is a proven leader on strengthening our relations with international partners while successfully securing significant international investments in Illinois. Last year she traveled to The\\xa0United Kingdom and Romania, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines, as well as\\xa0Japan\\xa0to meet with government, trade and economic leaders and corporate and business officials to highlight how Illinois is uniquely positioned for greater investment and increased exports with international partners. Following her last trip, Japan\\xa0announced\\xa0a\\xa0regulatory change that will lead to an increase in imports from U.S. biofuel producers, supporting our farmers and growing Illinois’s economy.\\xa0 In 2022, she also\\xa0traveled\\xa0to South Korea and Taiwan where she met with business, government and trade leaders, which helped lead to a joint venture between Illinois’s ADM and South Korea’s LG Chem, as well as a\\xa0commitment from Taiwan\\xa0to purchase an estimated $2.6 billion of our Illinois’s corn and soybeans. -30-  ',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON – U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) and U.S. Senator John Thune (R-SD), both members of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, today led a bipartisan group of their colleagues in urging the Biden Administration to permit the summertime sale of E15 fuel.\\xa0 The Senators note that American biofuels are a clean and reliable energy solution that will help drive down fuel costs forconsumers. “[W]e must pursue an all-of-the-above energy strategy, which includes leveraging domestic biofuels,” wrote the Senators.\\xa0 “As your previous temporary waivers have proven, permitting the sale of higher blends of biofuels like E15 through the summer driving season bolsters the domestic fuel supply, lowers consumer costs, and promotes the environmental benefits of American biofuels and modern agriculture.” “All of the conditions that made an E15 waiver so important in past years are still present,” said Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy.\\xa0 “If EPA doesn’t take action, American motorists would lose access to a more affordable fuel option this summer. We can’t afford to wait any longer – we need EPA to act now. We commend Senator Thune, Senator Durbin, and other bipartisan Senate biofuel champions for pushing the administration to do the right thing and allow E15 to be sold this summer.” “Providing continued access to a more affordable, lower-carbon fuel, like E15, will not only save drivers money at the pump, but it will also help farmers across the country,” said Harold Wolle, president of the National Corn Growers Association.\\xa0 “Yet, time is of the essence as we quickly approach the summer months. We are deeply appreciative to the bipartisan support we are receiving from our Senate champions on this issue.” “We thank Senators Thune and Durbin, along with all other Senate supporters, for calling on the Biden administration to quickly take action to allow the nationwide sale of E15 through the coming summer,” said Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association. “These senators understand that with ongoing geopolitical conflicts and the current oil and fuel supplies being at lower levels than the last two summer driving seasons, it is more important than ever that U.S. consumers have access to E15, the American made, lower-cost, and cleaner-burning fuel.” This letter was also signed by U.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Josh Hawley (R-MO), John Hoeven (R-ND), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Gary Peters (D-MI), Pete Ricketts (R-NE), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Tina Smith (D-MN), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), and J.D. Vance (R-OH). A copy of the letter can be found here and below: April 11, 2024 Dear President Biden: We write to request that you again take swift executive action to permit the sale of E15 fuel during the 2024 summer driving season by extending the Reid vapor pressure (RVP) waiver, nationwide, from June 1 through September 15. Enabling the year-round sale of E15, as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) permitted in both 2022 and 2023 through nationwide temporary waivers under Clean Air Act Section 211(c)(4)(C)(ii), helped allow our energy supply chain to “address extreme and unusual fuel supply circumstances caused by the war in Ukraine that are affecting all regions of the nation.” Unfortunately, this underlying justification remains applicable as Russia’s war of aggression continues to weigh on global energy and security. Further, Iran-backed aggression in the Middle East, specifically Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, presents new threats to global energy markets and our energy security. To counter these influences, we must pursue an all-of-the-above energy strategy, which includes leveraging domestic biofuels. As your previous temporary waivers have proven, permitting the sale of higher blends of biofuels like E15 through the summer driving season bolsters the domestic fuel supply, lowers consumer costs, and promotes the environmental benefits of American biofuels and modern agriculture. Furthermore, temporary action is again required in light of the EPA’s announcement to postpone until 2025 the implementation of eight state petitions to sell E15 year-round. As you know, the consideration of state action has led to a historic agreement between liquid fuel stakeholders in support of securing a permanent legislative solution to allow nationwide, year-round E15 sales, while respecting each state’s authority to opt-out of such a program. Taking temporary action now will continue the uninterrupted sale of E15 for what would be the sixth consecutive year, a major win for consumer choice and emissions reductions. Lastly, extending the nationwide sale of E15 could again add billions of gallons of ethanol to the fuel supply at a time domestic inventories of crude oil and petroleum products are at their lowest point since May 2004, below when the EPA issued its 2022 and 2023 waivers. Furthermore, additional decreases in OPEC oil production will only amplify the already robust market for U.S. exports at a time of rising fuel demand. American biofuels remain a straightforward, no-cost solution to shoring up our energy supply and reducing consumer costs, and issuing a waiver for the 2024 summer driving season remains in the public’s best interest. Thank you for your swift consideration of this request. Sincerely, cc: The Honorable Michael S. Regan, Administrator, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency cc: The Honorable Jennifer Granholm, Secretary, U.S. Department of Energy cc: The Honorable Thomas J.

It’s important to remember the gravity of this situation. Asylum seekers have been subjected to cruel—and even unknowing—relocation at the whim of Governor Greg Abbott and Republicans’ inhumane agenda. We need to uphold our country’s commitment as a welcoming nation formigrants, and that requires federal assistance. While I welcome this funding, it’s not enough to properly provide our city with the resources we need—and I’ll keep pushing for more funding to help our city and state,” said Durbin. As Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Durbin has worked to deploy federal resources to assist cities and states—including the City of Chicago and state of Illinois—in receiving asylum seekers. The minibus that was signed into law\\xa0included $650 million for the Shelter and Services Program, which Durbin advocated for. Since the start of Governor Abbott’s cruel, inhumane, and partisan stunt dubbed, “Operation Lone Star,” more than 38,898 asylum seekers have been transported to Chicago from the U.S.-Mexico border. Durbin has pressed President Biden to make additional resources available, including funding and additional work permits.

       " 'WASHINGTON\\xa0–\\xa0U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, called in Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center forTobacco Products Director, Dr. Brian King, and U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Brian Boynton, to his Washington office yesterday to brief him on the lack of enforcement against unauthorized e-cigarettes that are addicting millions of children across America. Durbin convened this meeting after repeatedly calling on FDA to protect children from the dangers of vaping.\\xa0 Yet, FDA continues to miss and delay critical deadlines forreviewing pre-market tobacco product applications (PMTAs) from e-cigarette manufacturers as the law requires, allowing harmful e-cigarette products to remain on store shelves.\\xa0 After being sued by public health groups, FDA was ordered by the U.S. District Court in Maryland to complete these reviews by September 9, 2021.\\xa0 More than two and a half years later, FDA has still not completed its PMTA reviews. In the meantime, thousands of unauthorized e-cigarettes have flooded the market, in violation of the law. In the meeting, Durbin questioned Dr. King on the FDA’s delay in reviewing PMTAs and reminded him that the agency’s inaction is leading to more children developing an addiction to e-cigarettes.\\xa0 Durbin pushed for answers on why FDA is neglecting to use its full authority to take enforcement actions against manufacturers or retailers found to be selling unauthorized vaping products. Durbin particularly raised concerns that FDA and DOJ have failed to act against unauthorized e-cigarettes, despite statutory and court-ordered directives to regulate these products. Last year, Durbin’s office examined FDA’s public data files to identify e-cigarette manufacturers who have received both marketing denial orders and warning letters yet continue to sell unauthorized products, in order to assess FDA’s effectiveness in taking enforcement action against some of the most flagrantly defiant examples.\\xa0 Durbin’s office found at least 22 vaping products that appeared to be sold online by the manufacturer in violation of the law and in defiance of repeated enforcement actions by FDA. \\xa0In addition to those products sold online by the manufacturer, several other such products remain available for purchase from third-party retailers, including one of the most popular e-cigarettes among children, Breeze Smoke.\\xa0 Durbin’s investigation also found that FDA has only issued “closeout letters” to 10 percent of the 685 tobacco warning letters it has issued since January 1, 2021.\\xa0 A closeout letter indicates that FDA has verified that corrective action has taken place to address the violations contained in the warning letter. Durbin asked Mr. Boynton about DOJ’s enforcement strategy regarding manufactures and retailers that have flouted FDA’s enforcement actions.\\xa0 Durbin probed why more aggressive action has not been taken despite FDA and DOJ’s clear authority under the law. “The law is clear. E-cigarette manufacturers must prove that a product is ‘appropriate for the protection of public health’ to gain market entry. But thousands of vape products on store shelves today, full of harmful chemicals and nicotine, have not met that requirement, yet are being sold and addicting children nationwide.\\xa0 For two and a half years, FDA has dragged its feet on completing its review of e-cigarette products, while at the same time has turned a blind eye to dangerous vapes that are illegally being sold.\\xa0 My patience has worn thin,” said Durbin.\\xa0 “I called in FDA and DOJ leaders to my office to understand why they are failing to enforce the law in the face of clear harms to children.\\xa0 I reminded them that they have a job to do and that they have the legal authority to stop unlawful e-cigarette manufacturers from flooding the market.\\xa0 I hope our conversation spurred them to finally take action to protect the next generation from a lifelong addiction to nicotine.” Durbin has been a vocal leader in the fight against Big Tobacco, particularly since he lost his father to lung cancer when he was 14.\\xa0 He went after Big Tobacco when he served in the House of Representatives and led the charge to ban smoking on airplanes, which eventually led to restaurants, office buildings, trains, and much more.\\xa0 Durbin has also led efforts to grant FDA jurisdiction over tobacco, raise tobacco taxes to prevent youth initiation, and enhance support for tobacco cessation tools. -30-',\n",

In their letter, the lawmakers requested an update on the produce prescription programming, noting that veterans have higher rates of illness as compared to other Americans.\\xa0 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 19 percent of veterans have diabetes and 12 percent of veterans have heart disease compared to 16 percent and 12 percent of all Americans, respectively. “We are writing to request an update on the Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) efforts to implement ‘produce prescription’ initiatives within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA),” the lawmakers wrote. “Veterans often suffer from higher rates of illness compared to the general population, in part because of the stress and trauma that veterans too often have experienced,” the lawmakers wrote.\\xa0 “VA research has found that there is a need for dietary interventions for the health management of veterans with chronic conditions.\\xa0 At the same time, veterans are at a higher risk for food insecurity than the general population, but are less likely to be enrolled in SNAP benefits.\\xa0 As such, it is essential to ensure that veterans have the support needed to address their chronic health conditions, including strategies to address access to healthy, affordable food.” The lawmakers noted that Congress approved $2 million in federal funding for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to implement prescription produce initiatives within VHA.\\xa0 In closing their letter, the lawmakers asked for additional information about how VHA has utilized the $2 million that Congress appropriated and about how it plans to scale the current produce prescription initiatives using the funds that Congress appropriated to serve more veterans across the nation. “There are now two ‘produce prescription’ initiatives at VHA facilities in Houston, Texas, and Salt Lake City, Utah.\\xa0 Does VA plan to expand ‘produce prescriptions’ initiatives to other VHA facilities across the United States?” the lawmakers asked in their letter. “Please explain in detail the resources, funding, or legislative authorities that the VA would require to expand ;produce prescription’ initiatives to other VHA facilities across the United States, including any barriers to doing so,” the lawmakers requested as they concluded the letter. Low fruit and vegetable consumption contributes to the fact that more than 50 percent of Americans have a diet-related chronic condition, such as heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes, and certain cancers.\\xa0 Veterans experience disproportionately higher rates of chronic disease compared to non-veterans, and 24 percent of veterans report being food insecure, which harms the ability to control their chronic diseases.\\xa0 Initiatives that support veterans in obtaining fresh produce can improve health outcomes.\\xa0 According to the American Heart Association (AHA), adults who participate in produce prescription programs consume 30 percent more fruits and vegetables a day.\\xa0 In this research, AHA found that all participants in produce prescription programs experienced a measurable decrease in blood pressure and blood sugar. A copy of the letter is available here and below:  April 15, 2024 Dear Secretary McDonough, We are writing to request an update on the Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) efforts to implement “produce prescription” initiatives within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).\\xa0 Nearly 60 percent of Americans have a diet-related chronic health condition, such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes.\\xa0 These conditions claim the lives of more than half a million Americans on an annual basis.\\xa0 In addition, these conditions take a significant economic toll.\\xa0 Diabetes alone accounts for $327 billion in annual health care expenditures in the United States.\\xa0 Veterans often suffer from higher rates of illness compared to the general population, in part because of the stress and trauma that veterans too often have experienced. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 70 percent of veterans are obese compared to 60 percent of all Americans, 19 percent of veterans have diabetes compared to 16 percent of all Americans, and 12 percent of veterans have heart disease compared to seven percent of all Americans.\\xa0 VA research has found that there is a need for dietary interventions for the health management of veterans with chronic conditions.\\xa0 At the same time, veterans are at a higher risk for food insecurity than the general population, but are less likely to be enrolled in SNAP benefits.\\xa0 As such, it is essential to ensure that veterans have the support needed to address their chronic health conditions, including strategies to address access to healthy, affordable food.

       " 'WASHINGTON\\xa0–\\xa0Following Iran’s attack on Israel this weekend, U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) today urged House Republicans to finally pass the national security supplemental, which passed the Senate in February on a bipartisan basis and would provide aid for Ukraine, Israel, Gaza, and Taiwan.\\xa0 During his speech, Durbin reflected on the ongoing threats that Iran posed prior to the attack on Israel. “I had the privilege of visiting our American service members stationed with the U.S. Navy Fifth Fleet in Bahrain—an impressive group keeping a close eye on Iran.\\xa0 Despite a relatively pro-Western population, Iran’s hardline leadership regularly has threatened the United States’ interests and its allies.\\xa0 Iran has long funneled money and weapons to some of the region’s worst proxies—Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis—some of whom have attacked U.S. personnel in Iraq and Syria.\\xa0 That is why I supported the Iran nuclear agreement under President Obama.\\xa0 Not because it would stop Iran’s belligerence in the region, but because it would prevent it from doing so armed with a nuclear bomb,” said Durbin. Durbin continued, “Well, this weekend we saw the Iranian threat in a massive attempted attack on Israel—one that Israel, with help of the United States and other allies, was thankfully largely able to thwart.\\xa0 I hope cooler heads will prevail and keep this conflict from escalating in an already unstable region of the world.” Durbin then condemned the actions of former President Trump who petulantly withdrew the U.S. from the Iran nuclear agreement. “Iran has also cozied up to Vladimir Putin, who is desperate for weapons from any rogue regime to fuel his disastrous war in Ukraine.\\xa0 So, it seems to me it is long overdue forHouse Republicans this week to stop doing Russia’s bidding by blocking the Senate-passed National Security Supplemental,” Durbin concluded.

       " 'WASHINGTON – U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Senator Chris Coons (D-DE) today introduced legislation to reduce the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) and the U.S. Marshals Service’s use of solitary confinement and improve conditions for adults in custody separated from the general prison population.\\xa0\\xa0Today’s bill introduction comes before the Senate Judiciary Committee’s full committee hearing tomorrow entitled “Legacy of Harm: Eliminating the Abuse of Solitary Confinement,” which will examine the frequent abuse of solitary confinement in federal custody, including members of vulnerable populations and those suffering from mental illness.\\xa0 The legislation is cosponsored by Senator Brian Schatz (D-HI). The\\xa0Solitary Confinement Reform Act\\xa0limits solitary confinement to the briefest term and under the least restrictive conditions possible because the overuse of solitary confinement threatens public safety, strains prison budgets, and violates fundamental human rights.\\xa0 The bill also improves access to mental health services for adults in BOP custody in solitary confinement, and provides resources to state and local jurisdictions to assist them in reforming their own confinement practices.\\xa0 Additionally, the bill protects the civil rights of adults in custody through the creation of a Civil Rights Ombudsman position and bans the practice of placing LGBTQ+ adults in custody in solitary confinement as a means of protection. “The goal of our criminal justice system should be to rehabilitate offenders and prepare them for successful reentry into our society.\\xa0 We have had some success—like the landmark\\xa0First Step Act—but the continued overuse of solitary confinement undermines this objective, causing psychological harm that is difficult, if not impossible, to undo,”\\xa0said Durbin.\\xa0\\xa0“I’ve had the opportunity to hear directly from men like Anthony Graves, who spent 16 years in solitary confinement for a crime he didn’t commit, about the devastating toll of isolation.\\xa0 That’s why I’m certain of the need to restrict and reform the use of solitary confinement in the United States.” “Solitary confinement doesn’t achieve its stated goals of improving safety in prisons or reducing recidivism among prison populations. Instead, it can cause lasting psychological damage in incarcerated individuals,” said Coons. “There are more effective, humane practices that maintain the safety and security of correctional officers, prison staff, and people behind bars. I’m glad to join with Chair Durbin in this effort to move us closer to a criminal justice system that focuses on rehabilitation and justice at its core.” According to a report by the Government Accountability Office, requested by Senators Dubin, Coons, and others, as of October 2023, BOP has not fully implemented 54 of the 87 recommendations from the two prior studies on improving restrictive housing practices.\\xa0 Durbin held the first-ever congressional hearing on solitary confinement in June 2012 as Chair of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Human Rights.\\xa0 Anthony Graves, the 12th death row inmate in Texas to be exonerated, testified at that hearing.\\xa0 As a result of the hearing, BOP agreed to Durbin’s request to submit the first independent assessment of its solitary confinement policies and practices.\\xa0\\xa0 In 2014, Durbin held a second hearing on solitary confinement in which he called for an end to the use of solitary confinement for juveniles, pregnant women, and those with serious and persistent mental illness.\\xa0 The late Damon Thibodeaux, a man held in solitary confinement for 15 years before his exoneration and release from prison, testified at the hearing. In February 2015, BOP released the independent assessment Durbin requested following his first solitary confinement hearing. The report identified areas where operational and policy improvements were needed, including mental health care, time parameters for restrictive housing, and the segregation of inmates in protective custody. In 2015, following the independent assessment, the Department of Justice (DOJ) undertook a review of BOP’s use of solitary confinement.\\xa0 In January 2016, then-President Obama announced that he had accepted a number of the DOJ’s recommendations to reform and reduce the practice of solitary confinement in the federal prison system—including implementing the ban on juvenile solitary confinement that Durbin called for in 2014.\\xa0 The ban on placing juveniles in solitary confinement was a key provision in previous versions of the\\xa0Solitary Confinement Reform Act\\xa0and was codified in the\\xa0First Step Act. BOP began implementing these changes and, until the Trump Administration, the numbers continued trending downwards. While this previous decline was encouraging, there was also a need for further reform measures. Durbin first introduced the\\xa0Solitary Confinement Reform Act\\xa0in 2016 to codify and build upon the DOJ recommendations for reform. -30-',\n",

It is simply not a constitutional crime worthy of impeachment for the current President and Secretary of Homeland Security to implement immigration policies that are entirely within the limits of the law and the discretion of the Executive Branch.” Durbin went on to call out congressional Republicans forblocking the bipartisan border security bill that was negotiated in the Senate and with the Biden Administration. “Despite repeatedly referring to the border as a ‘crisis,’ congressional Republicans’ opposition was based purely on Donald Trump’s insistence that Congress not pass immigration legislation.\\xa0 He wants to use it as a campaign issue in November.\\xa0 He doesn’t want a solution, a bipartisan solution that perhaps Joe Biden would be given some credit for.\\xa0 So, he stopped the whole process and stopped the bipartisanship,” said Durbin.\\xa0 “This partisan hackery is not lost on me or the American people.\\xa0 Instead of doing their job and working to find legislative solutions to complex, challenging problems, too many Republicans have decided that impeachment of a cabinet official for actually doing his job is a better exercise of time.” Durbin concluded, “Since 1986, the Senate has considered motions to dismiss brought by either the impeached officer or a Senator in six impeachments and has twice dismissed impeachment articles in the past.\\xa0 So, to say this has never been done is just not true.\\xa0 We should follow that example.\\xa0 I urge my colleagues to uphold the Constitution and the intentions of the Framers and quickly dispose of these unjustifiable articles of impeachment.” Video of Durbin’s remarks on the Senate floor is available here.

       " 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – As Americans mark Tax Day 2024, U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) introduced the Carried Interest Fairness Act today to eliminate a tax loophole that benefits wealthy money managers on Wall Street. The current carried interest loophole allows investment managers to often pay roughly half the tax rate that most other Ohio workers’ pay. Brown was joined by U.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Joe Manchin (D-WV) in leading this legislation. “This loophole is yet another way wealthy special interests have rigged the system to work for them, at the expense of everyone else. Hedge funds and private equity firms shouldn’t pay less taxes than working people in Ohio. This bill is a commonsense solution to promote fairness and make Wall Street pay its fair share,” said Brown. The carried interest loophole allows investment managers to pay the lower 23.8 percent capital gains tax rate on income received as compensation, rather than the ordinary income tax rates of up to 40.8 percent that they would pay for the same amount of wage income. The Carried Interest Fairness Act will require carried interest income to be taxed at ordinary wage rates. According to the Treasury proposal, closing this loophole will raise $6.5 billion in revenue over 10 years. In addition to Brown, Baldwin, and Manchin, this legislation is co-sponsored by U.S. Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Ed Markey (D-MA), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Bernie Sanders (I-VT),\\xa0 Jack Reed (D-RI), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Peter Welch (D-VT), and Cory Booker (D-NJ).

       " 'TOLEDO, OH – Today, U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) joined Doni Miller, CEO of Neighborhood Health Association, Gregory Kramp, Pharmacist at Neighborhood Health Association, as well as Ohioan Terry Hinkle to discuss his fight to lower insulin prices for Ohioans. During the event, Brown highlighted how the $35 monthly cap on the cost of insulin, made possible by the Inflation Reduction Act that Brown helped write and pass, has helped lower costs for Ohioans on Medicare. He also discussed his continuing push to cap the price of insulin at $35 for all Americans. “Last year, after years of fighting opposition from Big Pharma, we finally took major steps to lower the cost of insulin for older Ohioans. Tens of thousands of Ohioans are saving hundreds of dollars a year because of our price cap on insulin,” said Brown. “And we’re not stopping there. I’m fighting to expand the cap on insulin costs to all Ohioans, so that anyone who needs this lifesaving medicine won’t be forced to pay more than $35 a month.”  For years, Brown has fought to lower the cost of insulin for all Ohioans. Brown is supporting legislation to cap the cost of insulin at $35 for everyone. Brown also supported an amendment to the Inflation Reduction Act that would have extended the $35 monthly cap on the cost of insulin to all Americans. “We have all heard about the struggles people face due to the high cost of medication. It is heartbreaking to know that many Americans cannot afford essential medication like insulin, which is critical to their survival. By capping the cost of insulin, we are acknowledging that the cost of medication is a matter of life and death,” said Doni Miller, CEO, Neighborhood Health Association. “When people come to my pharmacy, their healthcare - getting the prescription they need - is my top priority. Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act,\\xa0 where insulin is capped at $ 35 a month for seniors, I know many seniors who have easier choices to make. They no longer need to make a choice between food and medicine. This act is a life saver,” said Gregory Kramp, PharmD, RPh. “I would like to thank Sherrod Brown for initiating this price cut because if I didn’t have this price cut, I couldn’t afford the insulin that keeps me healthy and alive. So therefore, I want to say thank you very much for that,” said Terry Hinkle, Ohioan Medicare Beneficiary who has benefitted from the $35 price cap on insulin instituted by the IRA. In the Inflation Reduction Act, Brown successfully pushed for provisions to allow Medicare to negotiate directly with pharmaceutical companies and take on Big Pharma to lower health care and prescription drug costs for Ohioans. Brown also successfully ensured that companies that increase their prices faster than inflation are required to pay a rebate to lower costs for patients and taxpayers. In 2025, the law will also cap out-of-pocket drug costs in Medicare at $2,000. In addition to helping to write and pass the Inflation Reduction Act, Brown has also taken the lead in efforts to lower drug costs for seniors by addressing abusive pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) practices.\\xa0In March 2023, Brown\\xa0pushed\\xa0for reform of PBM practices that lead to high drug prices for patients and high fees for Ohio pharmacies.\\xa0In July 2023, Brown introduced bipartisan legislation to lower out-of-pocket costs of medicines for chronic conditions by\\xa0requiring PBMs and insurers to pass on all savings they negotiate on the list price of a chronic condition drug to the patient at the pharmacy counter. Brown has also fought to pass his bipartisan\\xa0Pharmacy DIR Reform to Reduce Senior Drug Costs Act which would ensure that all pharmacy price concessions are assessed at the point of sale and eliminate the retroactive nature of direct and indirect renumeration (DIR) claw back fees imposed by PBMs. Sections of Brown’s bill on DIR reform and to lower costs for older Ohioans were included in\\xa0legislation passed out of the Senate Finance Committee on July 26, 2023. ###',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH), a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, joined a bipartisan group of colleagues in urging President Biden to permit the summertime sale of E15 fuel. The senators note that American biofuels are a clean and reliable energy solution that will help drive down fuel costs for consumers. “[W]e must pursue an all-of-the-above energy strategy, which includes leveraging domestic biofuels,” wrote the senators. “As your previous temporary waivers have proven, permitting the sale of higher blends of biofuels like E15 through the summer driving season bolsters the domestic fuel supply, lowers consumer costs, and promotes the environmental benefits of American biofuels and modern agriculture.” This letter was also signed by U.S. Sens. John Thune (R-SD), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Josh Hawley (R-MO), John Hoeven (R-ND), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Gary Peters (D-MI), Pete Ricketts (R-NE), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Tina Smith (D-MN), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), and J.D. Vance (R-OH). Brown has long been an advocate for lowering energy prices by using American-grown ethanol. In March 2023, Brown introduced the bipartisan Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act of 2023 which would enable the year-round, nationwide sale of ethanol blends higher than 10 percent, helping to lower fuel prices, support Ohio farmers, and provide price stability for consumers. In 2022, Brown called on\\xa0 the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to update biofuel emissions modeling. Brown helped successfully push the administration to suspend a federal rule preventing the sale of higher ethanol blend gasoline this past summer. The full letter is HERE and below. Dear President Biden: We write to request that you again take swift executive action to permit the sale of E15 fuel during the 2024 summer driving season by extending the Reid vapor pressure (RVP) waiver, nationwide, from June 1 through September 15. Enabling the year-round sale of E15, as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) permitted in both 2022 and 2023 through nationwide temporary waivers under Clean Air Act Section 211(c)(4)(C)(ii), helped allow our energy supply chain to “address extreme and unusual fuel supply circumstances caused by the war in Ukraine that are affecting all regions of the nation.” Unfortunately, this underlying justification remains applicable as Russia’s war of aggression continues to weigh on global energy and security. Further, Iran-backed aggression in the Middle East, specifically Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, presents new threats to global energy markets and our energy security. To counter these influences, we must pursue an all-of-the-above energy strategy, which includes leveraging domestic biofuels. As your previous temporary waivers have proven, permitting the sale of higher blends of biofuels like E15 through the summer driving season bolsters the domestic fuel supply, lowers consumer costs, and promotes the environmental benefits of American biofuels and modern agriculture. Furthermore, temporary action is again required in light of the EPA’s announcement to postpone until 2025 the implementation of eight state petitions to sell E15 year-round. As you know, the consideration of state action has led to a historic agreement between liquid fuel stakeholders in support of securing a permanent legislative solution to allow nationwide, year-round E15 sales, while respecting each state’s authority to opt-out of such a program. Taking temporary action now will continue the uninterrupted sale of E15 for what would be the sixth consecutive year, a major win for consumer choice and emissions reductions. Lastly, extending the nationwide sale of E15 could again add billions of gallons of ethanol to the fuel supply at a time domestic inventories of crude oil and petroleum products are at their lowest point since May 2004, below when the EPA issued its 2022 and 2023 waivers. Furthermore, additional decreases in OPEC oil production will only amplify the already robust market for U.S. exports at a time of rising fuel demand. American biofuels remain a straightforward, no-cost solution to shoring up our energy supply and reducing consumer costs, and issuing a waiver for the 2024 summer driving season remains in the public’s best interest. Thank you for your swift consideration of this request. Sincerely, ###',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – As Iran, the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism, launches an evil attack against Israel, Senator Rick Scott released the following statement today demanding that Majority Leader Chuck Schumer immediately put the House-passed Israel aid bill, as well as his Stop Taxpayer Funding of Hamas Act, on the Senate floor for a vote when the Senate returns to Washington on Monday. Earlier this week, Senator Scott wrote an op-ed for Fox News highlighting the need for the United States to stand strongly with Israel in its fight against Hamas and demanding that President Biden do more to hold Qatar accountable in its hostage negotiations role. This op-ed immediately follows Senator Scott’s visit to Israel, during which he met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other high-ranking officials to discuss the United States’ and Israel’s shared priority of destroying Iran-backed Hamas terrorists that have killed thousands of individuals, and continue to hold hundreds hostage, including Americans, since the October 7, 2023 attacks. Senator Rick Scott said, “Israel is once again under attack and the United States must clearly and strongly stand with our great ally and fully support its right and obligation to defend itself by any means necessary. I was just in Israel to meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu and see the terror and devastation that Iran-backed Hamas terrorists unleashed on the Jewish State on October 7th firsthand. More than 1,200 were murdered and hundreds are still being held hostage by Hamas. Americans are among the hostages and those murdered that day. The horrors of that attack are difficult to describe and can never happen again. Today, I am praying for the safety of the Israeli people and call on every Republican and Democrat to stand unequivocally with Israel as it fights for its very existence against evil terrorism. Again and again, Democrats have blocked the passage of aid for Israel. The House has passed a good bill that is ready for Senate passage right now. I urge Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to immediately put the House-passed clean Israel aid bill on the floor, as well as my Stop Taxpayer Funding of Hamas Act, the moment we return to Washington on Monday. Nothing before the Senate is more important and I will do everything in my power to make sure that vote happens. “Let us all remember who the enemy is and has always been: the evil, terror-supporting regime in Iran. Since its first days, the Biden administration has emboldened Iran with appeasement, freeing billions of dollars to fuel Iran’s support of terrorism and turning its back on Israel. Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East and one of America’s strongest allies, but it took President Biden months to meet or speak with Prime Minister Netanyahu after he took office, and the world took notice. Since October 7th, President Biden and Democrats in Washington have continued to undermine Israel’s fight against Iran-backed Hamas terrorists, further isolating our ally in its greatest time of need. America and the freedom-loving nations of the world are less safe and secure because of President Biden’s weakness and appeasement of evil regimes and the terror each support. I will always stand with Israel and again demand that the Biden administration and every member of Congress make clear today that they will do the same.” ###',\n",

But minority-owned businesses often struggle to win federal contracts, depriving those companies and communities of billions of dollars in opportunities. According to one study, had minority-owned businesses received FY20 federal contracting dollars in proportion to their share of the US business sector, they would have received $64 billion more in federal contracts. Black-owned businesses specifically would have received an additional $4 billion in contract awards and Hispanic-owned businesses almost $24 billion more.” “In 2021, President Biden committed to addressing this inequity through increasing federal contracting with Small Disadvantaged Businesses to 15% in FY25. Under your leadership, SBA has affirmed that the SBA Scorecard will reflect those milestones. As members of Congress, we write to remind your administration of this commitment and reiterate that publishing this data for all federal agencies will help legislators to understand the needs of America’s 33.2 million small businesses while fostering greater economic opportunity for marginalized groups.” Disaggregated data on race and ethnicity would show how these federal contracting awards for small businesses are being divided across racial and ethnic categories —\\xa0Black and African American, Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander, Hispanic and Latino, Native American, and other minority-owned small businesses – to monitor\\xa0equity and progress at a time when transparency is key to understanding the disparities faced by minority-owned small businesses.

       " 'WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senators Alex Padilla and Laphonza Butler (both D-Calif.) issued the following joint statement after NASA announced that they will fund the Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission at $310 million for 2024 and will request $200 million for the mission for FY 2025, falling far short of the funding necessary for the mission: “These cuts will delay the mission at a critical time, further diminish our highly-skilled workforce, and significantly undermine California’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and our state’s globally-leading science and space leadership as we face increasing competition with China. These funding levels are woefully short for a mission that NASA itself identified as its highest priority in planetary science and that has been decades in the making. We strongly urge Administrator Nelson to work with Congress to better balance these cuts so that the JPL workforce is protected and the mission proceeds while NASA and JPL evaluate if additional industry solutions are necessary.” \\xa0 The MSR mission, led by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, will launch a spacecraft from the surface of another planet and return it to Earth for the first time in human history. MSR will carry samples currently being collected on Mars’ surface by the Perseverance Rover — the completion of a decades-long project at NASA. Last month, Senators Padilla and Butler wrote to NASA Administrator Bill Nelson urging him to allocate the full $650 million necessary to fund the MSR mission in NASA’s FY24 spending plan, following the passage of the FY 2024 appropriations package, which\\xa0reiterated\\xa0Congress’ strong commitment to the MSR mission.

       " \"Despite greater need for caregiving than ever before, care workers across the nation are overworked and underpaid, resulting in a severe workforce shortage WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Bob Casey (D-PA), Chairman of the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging, Tim Kaine (D-VA), and Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) introduced legislation to tackle the caregiving crisis by reprioritizing long-term caregivers and supporting their work based on the value they bring to families across the Nation. Millions of families with aging loved ones and people with disabilities require skilled care to live, but many caregivers today work long hours for low pay, resulting in some workers being forced the leave their field for higher paying jobs. This instability has resulted in widespread worker shortages for those in need of essential care. The Long-Term Care Workforce Support Act would ensure that caregiving can be a sustainable, lifelong career by providing substantial new funding to support workers in every part of the long-term care industry, from nursing homes to home-care to assisted living facilities. By improving caregiver compensation, benefits, and support systems, the bill would ensure the Nation has a strong, qualified pipeline of workers to provide desperately needed care for older adults and people with disabilities. Companion legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives by Congresswoman Debbie Dingell (D-MI-6). “We have a crisis of caregiving in this country, and it’s a crisis that stems largely from a lack of support for and investment in our caregiving workforce,” said Chairman Casey (D-PA). “We cannot claim to be the greatest country in the world if we do not have the greatest caregiving in the world. We need to invest in these workers not just to ensure that caregiving can be a sustainable, lifelong career, but to improve the quality and availability of care for all who need it.” “Every American, regardless of where they live, deserves access to quality, affordable care throughout their lives,” said Senator Kaine. “But too often, direct care workers in long-term care settings are overworked and underpaid, resulting in significant workforce shortages – especially in our rural communities. I’m proud to co-lead this legislation to help address the root causes of shortages in our care system, including by improving compensation and by providing pathways to enter the field. This will lead to healthier communities, and improved quality of life for older adults, people with disabilities, and their caregivers.” “Having served as my grandmother’s primary caregiver as she aged, I know the hard work that goes into caregiving and the world of difference high-quality care makes for our loved ones,” said Senator Baldwin. “Right now, we're facing a desperate shortage in our long-term care workforce and sadly, it’s no surprise: many caregivers are forced to be on the clock for long hours, get low pay, and work in tough conditions. We owe it to caregivers who devote their lives to helping others to invest in the caregiving workforce, giving these compassionate workers the respect they deserve, attracting fresh talent, and ensuring our loved ones get high-quality care.” “Caregiving is the foundation of our economy. It allows for all other work to be possible. No care worker should have to live below the poverty line to do this work that millions of Americans depend on. As many know, this is deeply personal for me – I was lucky to have my husband John receive care at home, but many others do not have the same opportunity,” said Congresswoman Dingell. “This legislation will make much needed investments in our care infrastructure and workforce, including family caregivers, to ensure they have the support they need, are paid a living wage, and are able to continue doing their critical jobs.” Caregiving is in crisis across the United States. Caregivers are widely underpaid, earning a median wage of $15.43 an hour and often living in poverty. The result is caregivers are in short supply—a recent survey revealed 92% of nursing home respondents and nearly 70% of assisted living facilities reported significant or severe workforce shortages. Another recent survey of home and community-based services (HCBS) providers showed all 50 states experiencing home care worker shortages, and 43 states reported that some HCBS providers have closed due to worker shortages. The Long Term Care Workforce Support Act will address this crisis by stabilizing, growing, and supporting the direct care professional workforce. Specifically, the Long-Term Care Workforce Support Act will: Chairman Casey has led the Senate in calling out and fighting for solutions to the Nation’s caregiving crisis. In January 2023, alongside Senators Kaine and Baldwin, Chairman Casey\\xa0introduced\\xa0the\\xa0Better Care Better Jobs Act, with 41 co-sponsors, to enhance Medicaid funding for home care services for older adults, people with disabilities, and injured workers. In March 2023, Chairman Casey held a\\xa0hearing\\xa0to draw attention to the caregiving crisis and examine the economic benefit of investing in Medicaid home and community-based services. During the hearing, Casey joined Kaine and Baldwin to introduce the\\xa0HCBS Access Act\\xa0to address lengthy waiting lists, that sometimes last years and even decades, for home care services as the majority of older adults and people with disabilities contend with being forced to live in an institutional setting to access the services they need due to long wait lists, despite a preference for receiving care at home.\\xa0In October 2023, the Senators introduced the HCBS Relief Act, to provide support for state programs that fund home care services. The Long-Term Care Workforce Support Act is endorsed by 44 organizations, including Caring Across Generations, the Long Term Care Community Coalition (LTCCC), PHI, the National Alliance for Direct Support Professionals (NADSP), the National Disability Rights Network (NDRN).  The bill is co-sponsored in the Senate, including U.S. Senators Ron Wyden (D-OR), Angus King (I-ME), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), John Fetterman (D-PA), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Peter Welch (D-VT), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Tina Smith (D-MN), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Patty Murray (D-WA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Laphonza Butler (D-CA), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), and Ed Markey (D-MA).

       " \"Unrealistic Regulations Could Cause Operational Impact, Harm DoD Logistics WASHINGTON – At a hearing\\xa0this week, U.S. Senator Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, questioned U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM) Commander Jacqueline Van Ovost about the national security risks of California’s effort to enact net-zero emissions requirements for locomotives.Senator Fischer stated that California’s proposal would mean that around 65% of America’s locomotives would be prohibited from operating in the state starting in 2030. In her testimony, General Van Ovost said that the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) relies on the U.S. transportation network, which includes 15 nodes and five ports in California and the only West Coast port for containerized ammunition.Senator Fischer has opposed efforts by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and others to enact unrealistic emissions rules.\\xa0In March, Senator Fischer called the EPA’s finalized rule for light-duty and medium-duty vehicle emission standards an “attempt to appease climate activists” and instead advocated for practical, market-driven changes. \\xa0 Click the image above to watch a video of Sen. Fischer’s questioningClick here\\xa0to download audioClick here\\xa0to download video On the Operational Impact of CA’s Locomotive Emissions Rule:Senator Fischer:\\xa0The California Air Resources Board has a proposal that would significantly impact the ability of the national rail network to support the movement of Department of Defense (DoD) equipment and materiel deployment to the West Coast. This proposal would impose unrealistic emission standards and requires zero emission locomotives, which do not exist because that technology is not even commercially available at this point in time. And this means that about 65% of the nation's locomotives would be prohibited from operating in California starting in 2030. What would the operational impact be if railroads could not service routes in California, or had to divert cargo to other areas to meet the DoD logistics requirements?General Van Ovost:\\xa0Senator, we rely every day on this nation's transportation network, whether it’s seaports, it’s rail, or it’s roads. So, as I think about the reduction in capacity across California, I think about—I have 15 nodes in California that we use from two different railroad lines. And we have five ports, one of which is our only West Coast ammunition port for containerized ammunition, which is critical to our operation plans. And of course, we have close relationships with the railroad industry, and so, we are working with them as this is emerging and they're understanding what the implications are. Initially, I believe that any increased costs will be passed directly on to the customer. But I am concerned about the technology and their ability to recapitalize between the readiness of now and the readiness of future if they have to transition.Senator Fischer:\\xa0Have you expressed these concerns to the administration?General Van Ovost:\\xa0I have not.\\xa0Senator Fischer:\\xa0Do you plan to?General Van Ovost:\\xa0In my normal course of action through the Secretary of Defense, if this is going to impact national security, I absolutely will.On the Rule’s Impact on Readiness to Surge Forces in the Indo-Pacific:Senator Fischer:\\xa0When we look at the requirements that you have and the plans that you have, if we are seeing conflict take place in the Indo Pacific, how would a surge of forces be impacted?General Van Ovost:\\xa0Yes, ma'am. We think about options every day, and we run several planning events and several simulations that would occur around the globe. These globally integrated plans, should we have to surge for an event like the events after October 7th. And so, we think about it, and we run these simulations. And we ensure that we have readiness for the fleet. The most important thing is to ensure not only do we have the capacity, but it's a credible capacity to operate in the environment we expect to be in. We expect it to be contested,\\xa0and an example right there is the Red Sea.

The senators’ inquiry\\xa0comes following the Biden administration’s pause on all pending non-FTA export permit applications at the behest of the radical climate lobby. “As Deputy Secretary David Turk testified last month before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, DOE does not consider the current moratorium or pause on the issuance of new LNG export licenses to apply to extensions of existing projects. Delfin’s Floating LNG Project is the only LNG export project requiring an extension this year, as well as the only offshore Floating LNG (FLNG) project,”\\xa0wrote the senators.\\xa0 “Delfin has a very strong case that it has met both criteria for an extension per DOE’s policy. Construction of the project has already begun, and there were extenuating circumstances beyond Delfin’s control that caused significant delays in the export date…\\xa0Delfin’s project is also critical to the natural gas needs of our allies. Delfin has already secured long-term contracts with five LNG off-takers for a total revenue stream of $19 billion,”\\xa0continued the senators. Background Immediately following the Biden administration’s announcement that they would be freezing pending applications for LNG export\\xa0permitting, Cassidy\\xa0led\\xa025 of his Republican colleagues\\xa0in condemning the\\xa0decision. Our European allies, who have become increasingly reliant on the U.S. for LNG following Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, will now be forced to decide between depriving their citizens of energy or actively funding Putin. He also\\xa0introduced\\xa0the LNG Security Act to reverse President Biden’s decision to stop new American LNG export approvals and require the DOE to approve LNG exports to all countries that have imported, currently import, or are capable of importing Russian or Iranian natural gas. Additionally, he\\xa0introduced\\xa0the Unlocking Domestic LNG Potential Act, which depoliticizes the export of American liquefied natural gas. It eliminates the requirement for the DOE to authorize its export and instead giving the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) sole authority over the approval process.\\xa0 In February, Cassidy\\xa0penned\\xa0an op-ed with U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) in the Houston Chronicle underscoring the devastating economic, environmental, and national security impacts of President Biden’s decision to freeze new\\xa0LNG\\xa0export projects. In January, Cassidy\\xa0questioned\\xa0DOE\\xa0Deputy Secretary David Turk on the rumors surrounding this decision and emphasized the energy, economic, environmental, and national security importance of U.S. LNG exports. Read the full letter\\xa0here\\xa0or below:\\xa0 Dear Secretary Granholm, We write to request your appropriate and timely consideration of Delfin LNG LLC’s (Delfin) application for an extension of their current approval to export LNG to a non-FTA country (Ref. Docket Nos. 13-129-LNG; 13-147-LNG.). The export authorization under the current Department of Energy (DOE) license is valid until June 1, 2024. According to DOE’s policy statement, “Policy Statement on Export Commencement Deadlines in Authorizations to Export Natural Gas to Non-Free Trade Agreement Countries,” Delfin LNG LLC must file for an extension within 90 days of June 1, 2024. As Deputy Secretary David Turk testified last month before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, DOE does not consider the current moratorium or pause on the issuance of new LNG export licenses to apply to extensions of existing projects. Delfin’s Floating LNG Project is the only LNG export project requiring an extension this year, as well as the only offshore Floating LNG (FLNG) project. Delfin has a very strong case that it has met both criteria for an extension per DOE’s policy. Construction of the project has already begun, and there were extenuating circumstances beyond Delfin’s control that caused significant delays in the export date, including MARAD’s failure to follow the deadlines in the Deepwater Port Act and new NEPA requirements in the Fiscal Responsibility Act. However, should DOE conclude that the start-of-construction criteria has not been met, Delfin requests a conditional extension that allows Delfin nine months to make Final Investment Decision on the project. This conditional extension should alleviate any remaining DOE concerns about the project proving real progress towards actual export capability thereby reducing and helping to eliminate “LNG export authorization overhang.” Delfin’s project is also critical to the natural gas needs of our allies. Delfin has already secured long-term contracts with five LNG off-takers for a total revenue stream of $19 billion. Delfin’s single largest customer is Centrica LNG, whose parent company is the largest energy supplier in the United Kingdom. Over 15 years, Centrica LNG committed to purchase one million tonnes per annum of LNG. By granting this extension and allowing proven and newly deployed technologies the time to fully mature, DOE will both foster innovative FLNG technology and prevent stranded assets. We look forward to your action on this request as soon as possible. ###',\n",

But right now, our tax code has loopholes that allow super wealthy hedge fund managers to avoid paying their fair share,” said Senator Baldwin. “By closing the carried interest loophole, we’ll make our tax code fairer for working families, cut the deficit, and ensure that those at the top of the food chain aren’t exploiting the system to further enrich themselves.” “Currently, there is a loophole in our tax code that allows hedge fund managers to pay less in taxes for wage income than ordinary West Virginian and American workers, and these managers have taken advantage of it for far too long. Our commonsense legislation would close this loophole to ensure the wealthiest Americans are paying their fair share and contributing to our national economic growth rather than just their personal pockets. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this practical legislation that treats all workers fairly and moves to create a more equitable tax code,” said Senator Manchin. “This loophole is yet another way wealthy special interests have rigged the system to work for them, at the expense of everyone else. Hedge funds and private equity firms shouldn’t pay less taxes than working people in Ohio. This bill is a commonsense solution to promote fairness and make Wall Street pay its fair share,” said Senator Brown. The carried interest loophole allows investment managers to pay the lower 23.8 percent capital gains tax rate on income received as compensation, rather than the ordinary income tax rates of up to 40.8 percent that they would pay for the same amount of wage income. In 2017, Senate Republicans rejected Senator Baldwin’s amendment to their tax bill that was supported by every Democratic Senator to close the loophole. The Carried Interest Fairness Act will require carried interest income to be taxed at ordinary wage rates. According to the Treasury proposal, closing this loophole will raise $6.5 billion in revenue over 10 years. In addition to Senators Baldwin, Manchin, and Brown, this legislation is also co-sponsored by Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Ed Markey (D-MA), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Jack Reed (D-RI), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Peter Welch (D-VT), and Cory Booker (D-NJ). The Carried Interest Fairness Act of 2024 is supported by AFL-CIO, American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), Americans for Tax Fairness, Communications Workers of America (CWA), Main Street Alliance, Patriotic Millionaires, Public Citizen, Small Business Majority, United for Respect, NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice, National Women’s Law Center, Economic Policy Institute, and 20/20 Vision. “The carried interest loophole is one of the clearest examples of how the wealthiest rig the tax code in their favor,” said David Kass, Executive Director of Americans for Tax Fairness. “Rich fund managers should not be allowed to pay a lower federal tax rate than registered nurses or powerline workers. Ending this loophole is a common sense win for tax fairness.” A one-pager on this bill is available here. Full text of this legislation is available here. ###',\n",

       " 'On Sunday night, Congressman Salud Carbajal joined a bipartisan group of 91 Members of Congress imploring Speaker of the House Mike Johnson to allow a vote on the bipartisan national security funding package, which passed the Senate in February, in order to provide critical aid to Ukraine and Israel as well as deliver much-needed humanitarian aid to Palestinian civilians in Gaza. “The inaction of the House on this aid package is unacceptable, now more than ever. In the past week, we have seen Israel come under direct attack by Iran, using the defensive weapon systems that this aid package supports to prevent further loss of life. We have seen worsening conditions in Gaza increase the already desperate need for Congress to approve humanitarian aid. And our lack of additional support for Ukraine has given Vladimir Putin renewed cause to believe we have turned our back on the Ukrainian people,” said Rep. Carbajal. “I commend the President’s continued efforts to stand with our allies and partners and to prevent wider wars around the world, but President Biden’s diplomatic efforts alone cannot meet our national security challenges. The House must be allowed the chance to debate and vote on this critical aid package, which has languished for too long after enjoying widespread bipartisan support in the Senate.” In the wake of Iran’s direct attack on Israel this past weekend and increasingly perilous conditions in Gaza and Ukraine, Rep. Carbajal and his colleagues called for a vote as soon as Monday evening. “Time is of the essence,” the members wrote. “We urge you to put the Senate Supplemental Aid package on the floor for an immediate vote when we return on Monday. This aid package passed the Senate with 70 votes, Democrats and Republicans, and we can send it to the President’s desk for signature Monday night.” The full letter can be found here. As a Vice Chair of the New Democrat Coalition, Rep. Carbajal has been a leader in pushing for Congressional action on President Biden’s supplemental request for security and humanitarian aid in support of Israel, Ukraine, and Taiwan, as well as humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians in Gaza and funding to help address immigration backlogs and security challenges at the U.S. southern border. Rep. Carbajal has been pushing for consideration of this bill since February, emphasizing its potential to save lives in the short and long term. He has also been pushing the Biden Administration to help scale up efforts to deliver life-saving aid to Palestinian civilians in Gaza, seek the renewal of a humanitarian ceasefire, secure the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas, and emphasize to Israel the need for a strategy that protects civilian life. In addition, Rep. Carbajal has voiced concerns to President Biden over Israel’s military operational strategies, and signed a resolution calling for a renewal of a humanitarian ceasefire that had previously helped facilitate safe delivery of humanitarian aid and the release of hostages being held by Hamas.

       " 'Congressman Salud Carbajal (CA-24) thanked President Biden for approving California Governor Gavin Newsom’s request for a major disaster declaration, which will unlock additional federal storm aid for Central Coast communities impacted by recent winters storms, flooding, and other extreme weather. “I am grateful to President Biden and his administration for recognizing the severity of the storms that the Central Coast faced this winter and approving our request for additional federal support,” said Rep. Carbajal. “My team and I will work with our federal, state, and local partners to ensure these additional resources can be used to perform the repairs needed to fully repair our region.” On Saturday, President Biden approved the federal disaster declaration for San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Ventura, and six other California counties to unlock Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funding for repairing damages from storms, flooding, landslides, mudslides, and tornadoes that occurred between January 31 and February 9, 2024 in Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Ventura and other select California counties. Rep. Carbajal had personally urged President Biden to approve the request for additional federal support in a letter sent three weeks ago. In his letter, Rep. Carbajal detailed the damage seen across the Central Coast: “In the City of San Luis Obispo, the storm caused severe damage to eight steel firehouse rollup bay doors. In Santa Barbara County, the County experienced severe cold temperatures, snow in higher elevations, flooding, among other extreme weather. At the San Marcos Pass, Santa Barbara County rainfall gauges measured nine inches of rain and four inches of rain in the City of Santa Barbara within a 24-hour period. This prompted Santa Barbara County to issue a flash flood warning. Additionally, Mission Canyon and Mission Creek experienced severe erosion, causing retaining walls to collapse. In Ventura County, residents also experienced extensive flooding. This led to serious damage to our roadways, bridges, and other water infrastructure. Mudslides blocked State Route 33 in the Los Padres National Forest.” The major disaster declaration unlocks Public Assistance from FEMA for state, local, and tribal governments to support debris removal, emergency protective measures, and other emergency infrastructure and work measures on the Central Coast and elsewhere in California.\\xa0 Rep.

With today’s announcement, pregnant workers will finally have the peace of mind that they can stay on the job, provide for their families, and get the accommodations they need to maintain their health and the health of their pregnancy.” A Better Balance Co-President Dina Bakst said,\\xa0“We applaud the EEOC for issuing robust final regulations that appropriately recognize the broad scope of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act and ensure millions of workers, especially women in low-wage and physically-demanding jobs, can access the vital accommodations they need during pregnancy and after childbirth, to protect their health and keep their jobs. We are especially pleased to see leave for prenatal appointments and recovery from childbirth appropriately recognized as reasonable accommodations, benefiting millions of workers who currently lack any right to job-protected time off under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Today with these final rules, we have achieved a huge step forward for women’s economic security, maternal health, and the economy as a whole. The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is a life-changing protection for pregnant and postpartum workers nationwide, ensuring they aren’t forced off the job or denied the accommodations they need for their health. A Better Balance spent a decade making the legal case for the PWFA, grounded in the lived experience of thousands of workers nationwide, and are so pleased to see the EEOC has heeded our\\xa0call\\xa0for strong regulations to best protect them. Robust enforcement of this groundbreaking civil rights law will ensure workers with limitations stemming from pregnancy, childbirth, or other related conditions can fully rely on the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act’s protections, and have vital clarity as to how the law operates in practice, delivering long overdue dignity, fairness, and equality under the law.\\xa0 We look forward to continuing to empower workers around the country to use their rights under the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, and to work with the EEOC to ensure strong enforcement.”\\xa0 Vania Leveille, Senior Legislative Counsel, Liberty Division, American Civil Liberties Union, said,\\xa0“We applaud the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for providing important guidance to workers, employers, and the courts so that the full force of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act can be given effect. We thank Representative Jerry Nadler for his leadership in getting this law across the finish line and for reiterating his support before the EEOC. The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, and the EEOC\\'s regulations implementing it, are a critical step to protect the health and well-being of pregnant workers, particularly those from marginalized communities who are often overlooked.\" Jocelyn C. Frye, President of the National Partnership for Women & Families, said,\\xa0\"This is an important moment for pregnant workers, those with pregnancy difficulties or complications, and those who are considering having a baby. These workers can now rest assured that the EEOC will uphold their rights in the workplace, whether they need a break for water or to use the bathroom while on the clock, to adjust their working hours or some other accommodation. These rules further strengthen these protections for millions of workers, in spite of recent extreme partisan attempts to overturn this bipartisan law. Emily Martin,\\xa0Chief Program Officer at the National Women’s Law Center (NWLC) said,\\xa0“We applaud the EEOC for issuing strong regulations to implement the groundbreaking Pregnant Workers Fairness Act\\xa0These regulations will help ensure that pregnant workers have meaningful access to accommodations and employers can no longer use pregnancy as an excuse to push workers out of their jobs. These regulations will help ensure that no one has to choose between their jobs and their health or the health of their pregnancies. We are also gratified that despite attempts by anti-abortion extremists to play politics with our lives, the EEOC remained true to the law and followed long-standing precedent that prohibits discrimination against workers who decide to have an abortion. This comprehensive rule will help pregnant workers maintain their health and economic security at a time when they face escalating attacks on their rights.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Read the finalized rule here.\\n \\xa0 ###',\n",

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 70 percent of veterans are obese compared to 60 percent of all Americans, 19 percent of veterans have diabetes compared to 16 percent of all Americans, and 12 percent of veterans have heart disease compared to seven percent of all Americans.\\xa0 VA research has found that there is a need for dietary interventions for the health management of veterans with chronic conditions.\\xa0 At the same time, veterans are at a higher risk for food insecurity than the general population, but are less likely to be enrolled in SNAP benefits.\\xa0 As such, it is essential to ensure that veterans have the support needed to address their chronic health conditions, including strategies to address access to healthy, affordable food.

As part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023(P.L. 117-328), Congress provided $2 million for VA “to provide guidance and resources for VA facilities to develop local [produce prescription] program and pursue strategies for patient education and outreach.”  On April 25, 2023, VA announced that it would partner with the Rockefeller Foundation to expand access to “produce prescription” initiatives within the VHA.

The funding will support Maine’s sizable farming and agriculture workforce and economy, by expanding the capacity of the non-profit Rayitos de Sol Bilingual Childcare center through the construction of a new, larger building. The funding is part of the $454 million — for 185 projects — that the entire Maine delegation secured for state projects in the Fiscal Year 2024 Appropriations Package. “Affordable and accessible childcare is one of the most pressing needs for working families in Maine,” said Senator King. “This funding will be a critical investment in the Washington Country community and ensure our hard working farmers and seasonal agricultural workers can continue providing for their families. Access to childcare allows parents the opportunity to succeed in the workplace while having peace of mind that their children are well-cared for and safe.” “With this funding secured by Senator King, we are thrilled to be able to expand to serve 64 children — connecting families from different backgrounds and celebrating language and culture to enrich our whole community,” said Sean Douglas, Mano en Mano/Hand in Hand Operations Director. “This support will help Rayitos de Sol Bilingual Childcare serve infants and develop after-school programming, as well as expand our culturally nourishing food pantry, and build outdoor spaces to encourage nature based learning. We are excited to have the opportunity to realize this community dream and create a positive impact and investment in the families and children of Maine for generations to come.” Senator King has long worked to expand access to child care and reduce the workforce shortage in the critical sector. He secured millions to improve child care services in the 2022 and 2023 omnibus appropriations bills, and worked to authorize the planning and development of a new child development center at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. He is also the cosponsor of the recently-introduced Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit Enhancement Act, which would permanently expand the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit that helps households offset their child care costs. The 185 FY24 Maine investments secured by the entire Maine delegation can be downloaded as an Excel spreadsheet HERE and viewed on a map HERE. CDS funding is included in annual federal appropriations bipartisan legislation and provides a specific amount of discretionary funding to a state, locality, or nonprofit organization for projects with demonstrated civic and community value. Last year, Senator King secured over $250 million in Congressionally-Directed Spending for 140 Maine projects. Senator King is now accepting applications for FY25 Maine-based Congressionally-Directed Spending projects. Details on the FY25 CDS opportunity are available on Senator King’s website. ###',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON – U.S. Representative Pramila Jayapal (WA-07) released the following statement marking one year since the start of war in Sudan: “The people of Sudan have been suffering for far too long. For decades, brutal military dictatorships have denied the Sudanese people their basic human rights. And since the onset of the current conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) more than 12,000 people have been killed, 6 million have been internally displaced, 1.5 million have fled the country as refugees, and human rights groups have documented extremely high rates of sexual violence against women and girls in the region. Estimates also forecast that as many as 250,000 children and pregnant women could die of malnutrition in the coming months and only 30 percent of hospitals in Sudan are functioning. “In 2019, the Sudanese people inspired the entire world when they rose up and demanded an end to the dictatorship of President Omar al Bashir and a transition to democracy. In 2020, I had the opportunity to visit Sudan as part of a Congressional Delegation to meet with the new President in a celebratory moment. I met many of the leaders of the peaceful nonviolent movement, and seeing their courage and resilience continued to give me hope. It breaks my heart to see the country plunged back into chaos and widespread suffering. Too many of the Sudanese people have been displaced from their homes, and face not only the violence and cruelty of war, but also critical shortages of food, water, medicine, and electricity. “I have been in close touch with the U.S. Special Envoy for Sudan, Tom Perriello, and I appreciate his hard work towards a resolution to this horrific conflict. I urge the White House to utilize every tool in its toolbox — including sanctions for those involved in furthering this violence — to push for successful peace talks that implement the Sudanese people’s vision of civilian democracy and towards funding immediate humanitarian assistance from all our global partners. I am also working hard to ensure that all Americans understand the human consequences of what is happening in Sudan and become engaged in protecting innocent Sudanese civilians. We cannot turn a blind eye to the loss of life and suffering of the Sudanese people and their clear desire for a constitutional transition.” More than 1,800 people with Sudanese roots live in Washington State, greatly affecting many in Jayapal’s district. Below are some of their personal notes on the violence occurring in Sudan: “The war in Sudan has endured for one year too long, inflicting immense suffering upon the country and its people.\\xa0 The impact of the war is very personal to me. My family has been displaced and they had to seek safety and refuge in other countries. It is devastating for my parents to leave their family, their home and everything they worked for all their life. More than 25 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance. This is by far the world’s largest displacement crisis and no one is paying attention,” said Mubarak Elamin, Washington State Sudanese Community Leader. “The war in Sudan is something that I never fathomed would occur, at least not to the extent that it has become. Like many others,\\xa0 my family has been displaced, many of them who are elders, and are required to start over again. All that I have now are my childhood memories of summer vacations in Khartoum, in Burri and I’m still in shock that going back isn’t an option,” said Duha Mohamed, Washington State Sudanese Community Leader. “The war has inflicted trauma upon millions of people across Sudan. Many have depleted through the little savings that they had and are unable to find work due to the war. Those in the diaspora are now emotionally and financially stressed from having to care of their relatives in Sudan while worrying about their safety,” said Ahmed Salih, Graduate Student, University of Washington. “Beyond the headlines are very real stories that for those who are removed from the situation may forget, especially in a time where it seems like death and calamities have become all too regular. However, for people like me, they aren’t just headlines but have very real impacts on our very being. The recent massacres in various towns in El Gezira by the RSF have left many in my own family dead. While I am geographically far from the situation, my heart is still painfully affected by the senseless violence inflicted upon relatives and family friends,” Mo Ibrahim, MBA Student, Seattle University. \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIssues: Foreign Affairs & National Security  \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWashington, DC Office\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t2346 Rayburn House Office Building\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWashington.

       " 'Reports indicate that the United States Senate is poised to abandon – or quickly table – its Constitutional duty of holding a trial for the now impeached Secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas.\\xa0 This is a flagrant abuse of constitutional order and precedents of its own body.\\xa0 And it comes against the backdrop of the House’s grueling work to adhere to our rules and hold the Biden Administration accountable for its refusal to comply with immigration laws passed by Congress.\\xa0 I was one of the few House Republicans to vote to keep the impeachment procedures within the committee process and in keeping with regular order – a process that House Republicans doubled down on earlier this Congress.\\xa0 It’s now time for the Senate to do its job and hold a full trial of Secretary Mayorkas – anything less would be a dereliction of duty ironically in line with the violations of Mayorkas himself.  When I voted to keep the impeachment process of Mayorkas with the committee of jurisdiction, I stated then that shortcuts couldn’t be an option if there was any hope of the Senate following our lead and holding Mayorkas accountable via impeachment. I also stated that we shouldn’t be taking a page out of the Democrat playbook by holding a “snap” impeachment akin to what the Democrats did to President Trump in 2021.\\xa0 I certainly took potshots from elements of my party for doing so at the time, but I vote methodically and according to the rule of law and what is right morally.\\xa0\\xa0 While process and that vote gave rise to misguided political animus that was levied at me and other Republicans who voted to allow the House Homeland Security Committee to finish its investigation, it produced a stronger set of impeachment articles with even sharper teeth – which I was both proud to cosponsor and vote in favor of. We did our job by the book, refused to cut corners, and set novel precedent while doing so. In the end, I’m proud that my fellow House Republicans came to my position and committed to doing the hard work of a full impeachment inquiry, investigation, the committee process, and the successful impeachment of Secretary Mayorkas.  The Senate must respect the nearly year-long, five-phased investigation by the House Homeland Security Committee and the duly passed articles of impeachment. \\xa0The charges were of utmost consequence and were brought to avert a Constitutional crisis.\\xa0 Mayorkas refused to comply with the laws passed by Congress and breaching the public trust by lying to Congress about the security of the border and the actions he took.\\xa0 Actions like specifically directing through written memoranda that DHS employees violate immigration laws.\\xa0  Think about the chaos that has engulfed not only the southern border, but also the entire nation under Secretary Mayorkas’ watch. According to data from Customs and Border Protection (CBP), more than 7.2 million illegal aliens have been encountered at the southwest border since President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas took office. There have been north of 1.8 million known “gotaways” that have evaded CBP and escaped into the United States. Since Fiscal Year 2021, more than 300 individuals on the terrorist watchlist have attempted to cross the nation’s southern border illegally. Sadly, the list goes on and on.  If the Executive Branch won’t enforce the laws we pass, Congress has few options of recourse. We could refuse to fund Mayorkas and his department, but in what way would this further border security?\\xa0 Truly, impeachment is the only option left standing.\\xa0 The Senate must face these facts.\\xa0 It mustn’t run from our oral arguments, the review of evidence, and debate.\\xa0 It must hold a full trial and do its duty as opposed to putting its head in the sand. The fabric of our Constitution – the separation of powers – might very well be at stake. I call on the Senate to fulfill its constitutional duty by holding a full trial for these impeachment articles and hold the Biden Administration accountable for its abuse of the rule of law.

       " 'WASHINGTON – U.S. Representative Pramila Jayapal (WA-07), Ranking Member of the Immigration Integrity, Security, and Enforcement Subcommittee, is leading 47 Members of Congress in calling on Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to provide answers on the troubling treatment of individuals held in immigration detention facilities. Recent reports have detailed serious problems related to the performance of unnecessary medical procedures and the misuse of solitary confinement. “We have a responsibility to treat all human beings with dignity and fairness,” wrote the Members. “All facilities operated by or in connection with the United States government, funded by taxpayers should reflect that. These recent reports indicate that we are falling far short of our obligations. We urge the administration to take these reports and their recommendations seriously.” The United Nations has determined that solitary confinement lasting over 15 days constitutes torture. However, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and its subcontractors regularly detain individuals in solitary confinement for longer periods. Reporting shows that between 2018-2023, more than 14,000 individuals were held in solitary confinement for an average of 27 days, 682 for at least three months, and 42 for over a year.\\xa0 In addition to extensive stints of solitary confinement, which has been proven to result in long-lasting physical and mental harm, the DHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) has also published reports indicating serious concerns with medical procedures at immigration detention facilities. According to DHS OIG, between 2019 and 2021, at least 25 percent of surgeries performed at facilities run by ICE and its subcontractors were not properly approved, therefore ICE cannot confirm whether they were even medically necessary. Specifically, the Members are calling on DHS to provide answers to how they will ensure ongoing compliance with stated policies in all immigration detention facilities, to share the status of implementation for recommendations to phase out the use of solitary confinement, and to share whether ICE plans to advise the President of recommendations for reform. Jayapal has been an active leader on the issue of increasing accountability at immigration detention centers and phasing out the use of solitary confinement. She recently led 50 Members in calling for increased transparency over detention centers that had been recommended for closure, has called for accountability in the death of a detained person at the Northwest Detention Center who died after 1,418 total days of solitary confinement, and was a leader in ensuring accountability for more than a dozen immigrant women who underwent forced, unnecessary medical procedures at the now-closed Irwin Country Detention Center. She also leads the Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act, which would work to reduce our overreliance on detention, end the use of detention for profit, end inhumane conditions at detention centers, and protect the civil and human rights of immigrants.

Republicans attacked the program that Democrats included in Public Law 113-235. The goal in that law was to help the Marianas and other insular areas transition to cheaper, clean energy and expand our use of renewables like wind and solar. These sources of energy are abundant in our islands in comparison to the expensive, foreign-sourced fossil fuel Republicans prefer we use, which is why many constituents ask me for earmarks that fund alternative energy projects. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle do not seem to understand the severe energy challenges we face in island communities: we are not connect to larger electrical grids, we have increased susceptibility to natural disasters and climate change impacts, and our fossil fuel generators are outdated and inefficient—all of which makes electricity around two and a half times more expensive than in the states. During questioning, I stressed to the Republican witnesses their error in attacking a program geared to drive down the price of electricity in the Marianas where everyone Welcome to the on-line office for Congressman Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan.

       " '502 Cannon HOB, Washington, DC 20515Email Me(202) 225-6435 The Tidal Basin in Washington, DC, home of the Thomas Jefferson, the Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorials, is encircled by scenic cherry trees. Each spring the trees bloom in a picturesque display, drawing visitors from around the world. This popular tourist attraction is the result of a gift of more than 3,000 trees presented to the United States by the government of Japan. Likewise, in Western Nebraska we share a special connection with the Japanese people as we await the grand opening of the Japanese Hall and History Center at the Legacy of the Plains Museum. This week, the United States welcomed Japan’s Prime Minister, Fumio Kishida, to Washington, DC. Our relationship with Japan is absolutely vital, especially considering the country’s regional proximity to foreign powers who pose an open threat to our democratic allies and are increasingly working together. Just this week as North Korea’s dictator Kim Jong Un intensified his typically combative rhetoric, China sent a senior diplomatic delegation to Pyongyang to demonstrate the close ties between their communist regimes. Additionally, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, published disturbing new evidence of ongoing exchanges of weapons and oil between Russia and North Korea. In his formal address to Congress, Prime Minister Kishida raised concerns about the aggressive postures of these nations, the risk of a Ukraine-like confrontation occurring in East Asia, and even the possibility of nuclear conflict. It is important to keep in mind, as our most powerful adversaries seek to undermine freedom and opportunity in any country they can, Japan’s location places it front and center in this struggle. Because of this, Japan has wisely increased their own defense spending. The Prime Minister thanked the United States for our unique historical impact and ongoing responsibility to stand for freedom. He was realistic about the fact our common values, such as a commitment to democracy and openness are not shared by rogue states. He called upon the U.S. to continue to demonstrate leadership among those who oppose authoritarianism on the international stage. These values are the keys to a prosperous future, yet we cannot achieve this kind of security without robust engagement on rules-based trade relations. Japan is an important market for U.S. agriculture products, especially high-quality Nebraska beef. However, President Biden’s abdication on trade matters has put both the U.S. and our allies at a competitive disadvantage. This is inexcusable, and it’s the reason I worked with my Ways and Means Committee colleague from West Virginia, Rep. Carol Miller, and others to introduce a bill this week calling for greater U.S. engagement with Indo-Pacific trade partners such as Japan. The saga of United States-Japan relations is storied and gripping. The development of a historic partnership between our countries in the decades following our opposition in the Second World War is a monumental triumph of restored goodwill and continues to stand as one of the most important alliances we have in the world today. At the opening of his address, Prime Minister Kishida announced Japan will gift an additional 250 cherry trees to Washington’s planned Tidal Basin renovation project in preparation for the coming celebration of 250 years of American independence. With endless opportunity on the horizon, there is great promise for the United States and Japan to strengthen our cooperation and friendship. ###',\n",
       " ' Washington, D.C. -- Congressman Paul A. Gosar, D.D.S. (AZ-09), issued the following statement after voting against H.R. 7888, the Reforming Intelligence and Securing America Act, legislation to reauthorize Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, for two years. “Congress purportedly wrote Section 702 of FISA to protect\\xa0our national security by allowing the intelligence community, including the FBI, to spy on non-American threats without a court order. \\xa0However, FISA was never intended to spy on U.S. citizens.\\xa0   Unfortunately, since its inception, the FBI and the federal intelligence community have abused FISA by collecting the communications of American citizens without a warrant, raising serious concerns about the indiscriminate and broad nature of the surveillance program and further infringing on the rights of Americans.   For example, the FBI has abused Section 702 to conduct warrantless searches against American citizens more than 278,000 times.  Several good amendments were offered to improve and reform FISA, including a commonsense amendment offered by my friend, Representative Biggs, that would have prevented warrantless searches of Americans. \\xa0Sadly, 86 Republicans and 126 Democrats inexcusably\\xa0voted to allow the deep state to continue spying on Americans without a warrant by voting down this amendment.   As a result, I could not support the warrantless surveillance of Americans allowed under section 702 of FISA and voted against its reauthorization. It is a clear overreach of authority and is a direct violation of the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures.  While everything must be done to prevent future terrorist activities, it should not come at the cost of the privacy and civil rights abuses of innocent American citizens,” concluded Congressman Gosar.   ###',\n",

So, we need to continue to honor them and realize their importance to our society. I want to also thank Governor Moore: his leadership on the ground, being there every day. He has been the quarterback. He’s been the go-to guy to get this partnership with the federal government executed. So he has just been a rock star in this effort.\\xa0 “But at the same time, as I mentioned, as an appropriator, a bipartisan appropriator working with Congressman Harris, future appropriations chair Tom Cole. We’ve got to bring these dollars home in a positive way. But at the same time, the devil is in the details. And we’ve got to make sure we execute on President Biden’s promises. His promise to make sure that union labor builds this bridge. We need these projects to have Project Labor Agreements, so our union brothers and sisters can build the bridge the right way and on time. And we got to keep thinking about those that have lost wages: our longshoremen, our small businessmen, in the Port of Baltimore, 2.2 million dollars a day in lost wages. Guess what? Four hundred and thirty dollars a week unemployment ain’t going to cover it.\\xa0 “The special fund by the state, [makes it] maybe six hundred hundred dollars a week. That’s not going to cover it. They still got mortgages to meet, food to put on the table, so we need an all of government effort not to just let that slip through the cracks and say, ‘oh, the Port’s open now again. It’s June 1, too bad.’ The government, the President made a commitment to all those there to make up on those lost wages, and we’ve got to come through on that, and that’s what this team will do.

       " \" WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) on Tuesday spoke at a U.S. Senate Appropriations State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Subcommittee hearing on President Biden’s Fiscal Year 2025 budget request for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). In his questions to USAID Administrator Samantha Power, Murphy highlighted the challenges facing aid organizations in Gaza and discussed the deteriorating security situation in Haiti. Last week, Murphy visited Americares, a Connecticut-based, health-focused relief and development organization, whose partner organization in Gaza has suspended operations due to the danger facing aid workers. Murphy highlighted the consequences of this difficult decision: “They’re suspending those operations not because of a lack of access, not because of an overly bureaucratic process at the ports. They are suspending their programming there because they don't think they can keep their people safe because of our inability to do deconfliction in a meaningful way. They are not likely to resume operations until there is a cessation of hostilities, and so we just have to be pretty clear-eyed about the fact that until the bombs stop dropping, until the shooting stops, it’s going to be very, very hard to be able to do what we need to do inside Gaza and save the kind of lives we want to save.” On Haiti’s deteriorating security situation and the role the U.S. can play, Murphy said: “We have been the biggest humanitarian contributor to a country that continues to spiral out of control as gangs now control the majority of the capital. $171 million since October 2022 — I think we should be proud of that fact. But I think we all worry that Haiti is lurching into what may be a permanent state of emergency that is going to be a significant drain on what we have heard today are dwindling resources with lots of suitors and competitors. This is a really critical moment and I know there is a deep skepticism about the role that the United States has played and should play when it comes to restoring security in Haiti. He continued: “I convened a meeting of Haitian-American leaders in my state, and they had a variety of opinions as to what role the United States should play. So, I want to ask you a question, not about whether we should be a humanitarian partner in saving lives in Haiti, but what is the proper role for the United States to play right now in restoring security in Haiti? Because this seems to be a moment to double down on our work in that endeavor rather than just to sit back and let others lead while we continue to provide the bulk of humanitarian assistance.” Last month, Murphy released a statement on the deteriorating security situation in Haiti as violence erupted. In March, Murphy also helped introduce the Caribbean Arms Trafficking Causes Harm (CATCH) Act, legislation that would help curb illicit arms trafficking from the United States to the Caribbean by requiring the Coordinator for Caribbean Firearms Prosecutions to report on the implementation of anti-firearm-trafficking provisions included in the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. A full transcript of his remarks can be found below: MURPHY: “Thank you very much Mr. Chairman. Let me just make one addendum to this discussion about what is happening in Gaza today. Last week I visited a Connecticut-based emergency relief organization, Americares. They deliver mainly emergency medicines into conflict areas. They are amongst a number of organizations that have suspended operations in Gaza. “They’re suspending those operations not because of a lack of access, not because of an overly bureaucratic process at the ports. They are suspending their programming there because they don't think they can keep their people safe because of our inability to do deconfliction in a meaningful way. They are not likely to resume operations until there is a cessation of hostilities, and so we just have to be pretty clear-eyed about the fact that until the bombs stop dropping, until the shooting stops, it’s going to be very, very hard to be able to do what we need to do inside Gaza and save the kind of lives we want to save. “Administrator Power, I wanted to turn your attention to Haiti for a moment. We have been the biggest humanitarian contributor to a country that continues to spiral out of control as gangs now control the majority of the capital. $171 million since October 2022—I think we should be proud of that fact. “But I think we all worry that Haiti is lurching into what may be a permanent state of emergency that is going to be a significant drain on what we have heard today are dwindling resources with lots of suitors and competitors. This is a really critical moment, and I know there is a deep skepticism about the role that the United States has played and should play when it comes to restoring security in Haiti. “I convened a meeting of Haitian-American leaders in my state, and they had a variety of opinions as to what role the United States should play. So, I want to ask you a question, not about whether we should be a humanitarian partner in saving lives in Haiti, but what is the proper role for the United States to play right now in restoring security in Haiti? Because this seems to be a moment to double down on our work in that endeavor rather than just to sit back and let others lead while we continue to provide the bulk of humanitarian assistance.” POWER: “Well just to embrace the premise of your question that there is no humanitarian fix to a complete breakdown in security as is happening in so many neighborhoods and in the capital. Look, I think the U.S. role has been on display over the course actually of several years, going around the world and trying to find a partner who was willing to put security forces, in this case police forces, on the ground in Haiti, securing the commitment. Huge thanks to the Kenyans and to President Ruto for being willing to step forward. And that was of course in an environment that was already unstable, already very, very difficult and now all the more so. “These conversations are ongoing, but mobilizing the resources that we have in order to be in a position to support the payment of salaries — because this is of course not a traditional UN peacekeeping mission, it is blessed by the UN but not funded by the UN— I think that’s an important role for the United States. But so is the diplomacy we’ve done to get other countries, like the Canadians and many of the Europeans as well, to step up and fund and equip that force. “But the diplomacy around the three legs of the stool — security, humanitarian welfare, and governance — and the fact there hasn't been a legitimately elected government in Haiti is something that has surely contributed to the breakdown in security as well as gangs and others use that at least as a pretext for their vigilantism. “So, the efforts to pull together a transition, USAID stands ready with a lot of election support when we are in a position to provide it and when there is a roadmap to elections, but you won't get security without governance and of course you can't get that roadmap to elections until we have a baseline of security.” MURPHY: “Yeah, I think we’ve got a really short window in which to figure out the path forward and find those international partners. Let me pull back and ask you one additional question about China competition. Really excited about the work you are doing to better evaluate the impact of programs on the ground, but there is an asymmetry between how we view our aid and how China views its aid. “We are looking at the impact of our aid largely through a policy lens, trying to impact the largest number of people possible. China is really looking at their aid more so through a political lens. An example is, you know, often there are pet projects that dictators or quasi-dictators have around the world that we don't see as a real ROI for the citizens of that country. We aren’t willing to put our dollars behind it, but China will. Do you see it as an exposure to the United States that our aid is more focused on how many people we can help and China's aid is focused more on how many officials they can influence? How do we balance that asymmetry?” POWER: “Needless to say, I think our budget request is and particularly the investments in global infrastructure efforts are a reflection of our desire to be more competitive in terms of the kinds of resources that we are investing. So that’s quantity. We should be showing up. They are actually receding. From having become the world's largest debt collector, their investments are way down in fact, over the last two or three years, having become overextended, not getting maybe the return on investment that they had sought, being in that position of being debt collector, they’re rethinking what they are doing. “There is an opening, there is a real opening. But I do think our competitive advantage is quality, fundamentally. And that involves not only quality of infrastructure, transparent procurement, not having the investments we make benefit the few rather than the many, but it’s also the quality of what, for example, an agency like USAID can come in with to align with infrastructure that is being built. You've heard a lot about the Lobito Corridor, the flagship initial major investment associated with the PGI. We are looking at mobile money, so small-scale farmers can better access resources in order to take that loan out, in order to be able to get the access to capital they need to grow their business for when that rail exists. We will actually support them in getting their goods to market, but getting them digitized is a prerequisite for the growth that they envisage for themselves. “USAID is funding a public-private partnership with the Department of Transportation in Angola to help them do other concessions for their infrastructure, but again in a manner that is transparent, that changes the enabling environment, hopefully over time sees civil society also empowered to scrutinize what is being done in governmental circles. It’s an entirely different model, but it reflects that, or my response at least tries to reflect, the toolkit that we need to bring to bear, which is both about the hard infrastructure which people are craving, but also aligning development, human development, along with those investments. “We can build a railroad, but if we aren't actually investing in nutrition and education and small- to medium-sized enterprises en route at the same time, the return on that investment is going to be much more limited. The last thing I would say is just the polling is very striking about public reactions in the countries that have taken that alternate development approach, and a real souring on seeing those big infrastructure projects that either aren't actually of the quality that citizens need in terms of their infrastructure – some of them are, but many of them are not – that are saddling publics with debt in the longer term, but also that are bringing in workers from outside the country rather than using infrastructure as a source of employment in the countries themselves. So I think the polls are the best diagnostic about whether we need to change or whether we just need to scale what we are trying to do.” ###\",\n",
       " \"  WASHINGTON–U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Chairman of the U.S Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security, on Wednesday held a hearing on President Biden’s Fiscal Year 2025 funding request for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. In his remarks, Murphy called out Senate Republicans for their role in prolonging the crisis at the southern border and criticized unfounded attempts to place the blame on Secretary Mayorkas. Murphy highlighted Republicans’ hypocrisy in killing the bipartisan border bill earlier this year: “This budget doesn’t provide enough money, and this budget by definition cannot update the immigration laws of this country, which are outdated and broken. But do you know what did provide enough money? Do you know what did update and fix our broken laws? The bipartisan border bill negotiated by myself, Senator Lankford, Senator Sinema with help from Senator McConnell and Senator Graham. It would have provided $20 billion in extra emergency funding to buy 50,000 detention beds, to hire 4,300 new asylum officers, 100 new immigration judges, 1,500 border patrol agents, 1,000 new deportation officers. The list goes on and on. He added: “In addition, our bill would have made a massive downpayment on fixing our broken border and immigration authorities. It would have given the power to the president to close portions of the border to ordinary asylum claims during periods of high crossings. It would have elevated the screening standards for asylum claims to make sure that only truly meritorious claimants enter the country. It would have reduced, maybe most importantly, the time to process an asylum application from 10 years, in some cases, to just weeks, or, at worst, months. It would have a eliminated the use of 235(a) parole at the border and greatly narrowed and refined the uses of humanitarian parole. That is just the tip of the iceberg. If passed, this would have been the most significant, most serious reform of immigration law in 40 years. And it would have been effective at slowing the pace of arrivals at the southern border and making sure that our system of legal immigration, a key to American greatness, is not abused. And that’s why it’s not the law. It’s not the law because it would have made a big downpayment on fixing the problem. Republicans rejected this bill because they didn’t want to fix the problem. Donald Trump and Republicans decided they would be better off with the border a mess because it would help them politically “ On Republicans’ baseless attempts to impeach Secretary Mayorkas, Murphy said: “These articles are laughable on their face. One accuses the Secretary of a high crime and misdemeanor for failing to stop millions of noncitizens from being released into the United States. Let's be clear. Despite Congress’ inability to respond to this crisis, the Biden administration and Secretary Mayorkas have removed, returned or expelled more migrants in three years than the Trump administration did in four years. The annual apprehension rate is the exact same between the Trump administration and the Biden administration. Another impeachment article rages about the immigration court backlog—a backlog that has existed in both Republican and Democratic administrations; a backlog that is the consequence of Congress's unwillingness to adequately fund a solution; a backlog that—wait for it—would have been solved by the bipartisan border bill that the House Republicans so honestly concerned about the state of immigration killed.” Mayorkas explained how the bipartisan border deal would have helped address the challenges at the borders: “This piece of bipartisan legislation would've been the most transformative change to our broken immigration system, not only for the resources it provided but for the changes in the law that it delivered. It would have brought such extraordinary fairness and speed to a system that has suffered backlogs and interminable timelines in the processing of claims. It would have plussed up our personnel in an unprecedented fashion, as you have commented. It would have allowed us to adjudicate asylum claims that now take more than seven years to run through the courts in sometimes less than 90 days. Absolutely transformative, not only from an efficiency perspective, but also fundamentally from a security perspective.” On the flow of fentanyl into the United States and the flow of guns into Mexico, Murphy said: “The fentanyl trade between the United States and Mexico is a circle. Fentanyl comes into the United States, money and guns leave the United States. That is why on a bipartisan basis we have provided additional money for outbound inspections so that we are catching not all, but an appreciable amount of guns and money as it leaves the United States. This trade can only work if the guns and the money leave and the fentanyl comes back.” A full transcript of Murphy’s opening remarks can be found below: “Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to today's hearing concerning Fiscal Year 2025 and the budget request from the Department of Homeland Security. Calling this hearing to order, and we welcome Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas to testify about the FY25 request. Thank you for being here on a very busy day. Looking forward to a serious and lively discussion about the department's budget priorities for the coming year. Nothing is more important in our federal budget than supporting the 260,000 federal employees who spend every day defending our nation. I’ve reviewed the President's proposed budget. I support lots of it, I have questions about other parts, and I look forward to our subcommittee's bipartisan work. I want to use the rest of my time here today to address two elephants that linger in the room. “First, this budget, even with this proposed increase, is not enough to secure our border and manage the unusually high levels of immigration to the United States that started not in 2021 or 2022 but in 2019; not when President Biden took office but when President Trump was president. This budget doesn’t provide enough money, and this budget by definition cannot update the immigration laws of this country, which are outdated and broken. But do you know what did provide enough money? Do you know what did update and fix our broken laws? The bipartisan border bill negotiated by myself, Senator Lankford, Senator Sinema with help from Senator McConnell and Senator Graham. It would have provided $20 billion in extra emergency funding to buy 50,000 detention beds, to hire 4,300 new asylum officers, 100 new immigration judges, 1,500 border patrol agents, 1,000 new deportation officers. The list goes on and on. “In addition, our bill would have made a massive downpayment on fixing our broken border and immigration authorities. It would have given the power to the president to close portions of the border to ordinary asylum claims during periods of high crossings. It would have elevated the screening standards for asylum claims to make sure that only truly meritorious claimants enter the country. It would have reduced, maybe most importantly, the time to process an asylum application from 10 years, in some cases, to just weeks, or, at worst, months. It would have a eliminated the use of 235(a) parole at the border and greatly narrowed and refined the uses of humanitarian parole. “That is just the tip of the iceberg. If passed, this would have been the most significant, most serious reform of immigration law in 40 years. And it would have been effective at slowing the pace of arrivals at the southern border and making sure that our system of legal immigration, a key to American greatness, is not abused. And that’s why it’s not the law. It’s not the law because it would have made a big downpayment on fixing the problem. “Republicans rejected this bill because they didn’t want to fix the problem. Donald Trump and Republicans decided they would be better off with the border a mess because it would help them politically. That's not me saying that. Here's what one honest Republican senator said: ‘The border is a very important issue for Donald Trump, and the fact that he would communicate to Republican senators and congresspeople that he doesn’t want us to solve the border problem because he wants to blame Biden for it is really appalling.’ Now I'm eager to hear about the President's budget request. But we could have done something together in a bipartisan way to give the real levels of adequate funding, real changes in law to protect our nation. “The second thing that hangs over this hearing is the political impeachment articles that are about to be sent to the Senate. There's not a single act of impeachable misconduct alleged by these articles. The process was an embarrassment to the House of Representatives. These articles are laughable on their face. One accuses the Secretary of a high crime and misdemeanor for failing to stop millions of noncitizens from being released into the United States. “Let's be clear. Despite Congress’ inability to respond to this crisis, the Biden administration and Secretary Mayorkas have removed, returned or expelled more migrants in three years than the Trump administration did in four years. The annual apprehension rate is the exact same between the Trump administration and the Biden administration. Another impeachment article rages about the immigration court backlog—a backlog that has existed in Republican and Democratic administrations; a backlog that is the consequence of Congress's unwillingness to adequately fund a solution; a backlog that—wait for it—would have been solved by the bipartisan border bill that the House Republicans, so honestly concerned about the state of immigration, killed. “But what makes me most angry about this impeachment is its attempts to personally impugn Secretary Mayorkas. His life is one of public service: the youngest U.S. Attorney confirmed by the Senate; the former director of USCIS; the former Deputy Director of DHS. He has sought out the toughest, most controversy-laden jobs in government. He was in the room personally for nearly all of our four months of torturous negotiations. Why? Because Republicans and Democrats trusted him. Because Republicans asked for him to be in that room because they knew that he would be an honest broker. So we are very lucky, in my mind, to have Secretary Mayorkas protecting our nation. He shouldn’t have to endure this process, but we are glad that he is here today.” A full transcript of Murphy’s exchange with Secretary Mayorkas can be found below: MURPHY: “I have first a personnel question for you. Jeff Rezmovic was nominated to be the Chief Financial Officer of DHS last year. His nomination has been pending for some time before the Senate. Of course, his nomination is especially important to the Appropriations Committee. It doesn’t make a lot of sense to have an agency this large without a CFO for this long. I assume you would agree with me that his confirmation, the ability to get a CFO working with you at the Department, is of the utmost importance.” MAYORKAS: “It most certainly is, Mr. Chair. I have worked very closely with Jeff Rezmovic for about seven years now, previously when I was a Deputy Secretary, and let me say unequivocally that he is pure gold as a public servant. I should also note that the woman over my left shoulder, Anne Tipton, who is serving as our Chief Financial Officer, is also pure gold. We need a Senate confirmed CFO for the stabilization that it provides our department.” MURPHY: “You heard me testify to the amount of resources that would've been allocated in the emergency supplemental that included $20 billion to surge to 50,000 detention beds, to hire over 4,000 new asylum officers to attack the backlog, 1,500 new border patrol agents and officers. Can you talk for a moment about what those kind of resources would have allowed you to do had both Republicans and Democrats come together and supported that bipartisan supplemental package?” MAYORKAS: “Chair Murphy, my first encounter with the immigration system, the broken immigration system, was in the 1990s when I served as a federal prosecutor in California. And I learned then that the system was fundamentally broken, and it remains so. This piece of bipartisan legislation would've been the most transformative change to our broken immigration system, not only for the resources it provided but for the changes in the law that it delivered. It would have brought such extraordinary fairness and speed to a system that has suffered backlogs and interminable timelines in the processing of claims. It would have plussed up our personnel in an unprecedented fashion, as you have commented. It would have allowed us to adjudicate asylum claims that now take more than seven years to run through the courts in sometimes less than 90 days. Absolutely transformative, not only from an efficiency perspective, but also fundamentally from a security perspective.” MURPHY: “Let me ask you specifically about how you achieve an increased deterrence. I think there's a perception here that by just loading up on detention beds, you can have an appreciable impact on deterrence. But what the bipartisan bill tried to do at your and others' urging was to provide more immediate certainty on asylum claims, to adjudicate those claims in a handful of days or weeks instead of what happens today, five years or ten years. Now that is just the right thing to do for the country. It’s just fair to have that outcome at the border rather than 10 years later. But tell us a little bit about the elements of this bill, including that element, that would've had an impact on deterrence, that would've stopped people from ever contemplating the journey to the border, and how that can only be achieved by changes in law, not just changes in funding levels.” MAYORKAS: “Absolutely, Mr. Chair. So fundamentally, the risk calculus of intending migrants would have changed dramatically, because right now, what they see is a broken asylum system, and they understand that when they are encountered at the border and make a claim for asylum, their claim is ultimately adjudicated sometimes in more than seven years. Our backlog is immense, and it's been growing year over year for well more than a decade. And what happens is, in those seven years, they work. Sometimes they have United States citizen children. And they gain a sense of footing in the United States before their claim to stay here has even been adjudicated. Under the bipartisan legislation, that multi-year process would have been transformed to as little as 90 days and sometimes even quicker, and given the denial rate for most asylum claims, an intending migrant would have the calculus of deciding: should I take that dangerous journey, should I place my life savings in the hands of smugglers, only to be turned around upon arrival in the United States within 90 days? An absolute game changer.” MURPHY: “Finally, let me ask you about a topic that we’ve spent a lot of time talking about relative to the fentanyl trade. The fentanyl trade between the United States and Mexico is a circle. Fentanyl comes into the United States, money and guns leave the United States. That is why on a bipartisan basis we have provided additional money for outbound inspections so that we are catching not all, but an appreciable amount of guns and money as it leaves the United States. This trade can only work if the guns and the money leave and the fentanyl comes back. What percentage of traffic today is subject to outbound inspection, and what's a realistic projection for how we’re gonna expand outbound inspections in this fiscal year?” MAYORKAS: “Chair Murphy, I’ll have to get the precise numbers to you subsequent to this hearing, but let me say that CBP, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and Homeland Security Investigations, the investigative arm of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, are working in tandem to address the outbound flow of both money and guns. In fact, Operation Without a Trace—we’ll provide the data to you—has been an extraordinarily effective operation to curtail the movement of guns and money. We also have deployed transnational criminal investigative units to Mexico to work with our law enforcement partners in Mexico to address this issue and we are of course very well and closely aligned with our U.S. Department of Justice.” MURPHY: “Great, look forward to that update.” ###\",\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON–U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) on Friday released the following statement on the U.S. Department of Justice’s (DOJ) finalized rule to specify the definition of “engaged in the business” as a dealer in firearms.\\xa0Murphy’s\\xa0Bipartisan Safer Communities Act\\xa0clarified the definition of who is “engaged in the business” of dealing in firearms as a person doing so with the intent to “predominately earn a profit.” The finalized rule amends the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives’ (ATF) regulations to conform with the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, clarifying who must register as a federally licensed firearms dealer and conduct background checks on gun sales. “Today’s announcement is a landmark day for the implementation of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act that will significantly increase the number of background checks performed and help keep guns out of dangerous hands. For too long, the law allowed individuals who were clearly in business as a firearms dealer to sell guns for profit without conducting background checks, permitting thousands of gun sales to fly under the radar each year. That’s why our legislation made this important change to expand background checks by broadening the definition of who is engaged in the business. This rule brings us closer to the goal of universal background checks and will save lives,” said Murphy. In December, Murphy submitted a public comment in support of the U.S. Department of Justice’s (DOJ)\\xa0proposed rule.\\xa0In September, Murphy highlighted the importance of this rule and how it will increased the number of background checks on gun sales. ###',\n",
       " \"Washington, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senators Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) released a new report: Servicing Scandals: Student Loan Servicers’ Failures During Return to Repayment, which reveals\\xa0 a decades-long pattern of student loan servicer incompetence and misconduct that has affected millions of borrowers nationwide. The report examines servicer failures during the return to repayment and how these countless billing errors and customer service problems harmed borrowers. The report comes as Senator Warren chairs a hearing today of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee’s Subcommittee on Economic Policy on MOHELA’s performance as a student loan servicer. The report includes new information about loan servicers' performance during the return to repayment\\xa0 provided by the Department of Education and from loan servicers' responses to Congressional inquiries.\\xa0 This data indicated that, in total, servicers made more than 3.9 million billing-related errors during the return to repayment. “Rampant student loan servicing errors have left millions of borrowers confused about how much they owe and when. These student loan servicers are further proving to the American people the absurdity of saddling students who are working to achieve their educational dreams with expensive and burdensome loans. We must work towards a world where students don’t have to worry about taking on any debt at all. In the meantime, the Biden administration needs to take steps to ameliorate the harm that these servicers have inflicted on borrowers,” said Senator Markey.\\xa0 “It’s clear that all servicers misled borrowers and screwed up the resumption of student loan repayments, making a whopping 3.9 million errors,” said Senator Warren. “For decades, loan servicers misled and harmed borrowers who have done everything right. It’s time for real action and accountability.”\\xa0 “The findings of this report paint a harrowing picture, and borrowers deserve justice—these servicers must remedy these harms and resolve this nightmare for borrowers. Student loan debt in the United States is more than $1.6 trillion dollars, impacting over 42 million Americans. For too long, student loan servicers have harmed borrowers with deceitful tactics, including incorrect and late billing statements, low quality customer service, slow processing times, and an overall lack of transparency,” said Senator Blumenthal. “Millions of Americans struggle under the weight of student debt, hindering their opportunities and holding back our entire economy. And as this report shows, systemic incompetence and mismanagement across the student loan servicing industry spanning many years – as well as the millions of billing errors that have occurred since the return to repayment after the pandemic pause – have only made things harder for these Americans. The Biden Administration has made critical improvements through their new industry accountability measures, but we must do more to help those who have been impacted by servicers’ failures and to ensure that their actions don’t hinder the Administration’s work to provide relief to millions of borrowers,” said Senator Van Hollen. The report found that every single student loan servicer—EdFinancial, Maximus, MOHELA, and Nelnet—failed to adequately prepare for the transition back to repayment despite numerous warnings and federal funds throughout the payment pause. As a result, millions of borrowers experienced billing-related errors and poor customer service, made unnecessary payments, and were denied debt relief due to servicing mistakes.\\xa0 The report calls for a clear path to cancel debt for borrowers who are harmed by servicer failures as the Department of Education works through the rulemaking process for student debt cancellation under the Higher Education Act.\\xa0 Key findings from the report include:\\xa0\",\n",
       " 'Bill would establish an education and grant program in NOAA to educate the next generation of climate leaders Bill Text (PDF) Washington (April 11, 2024) – Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Clean Air, Climate, and Nuclear Safety, and Representative Debbie Dingell (MI-12) today reintroduced the Climate Change Education Act, which would establish a Climate Change Education Program within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to provide grants and technical assistance to state and local education agencies, institutions of higher learning, professional associations and academic societies, and youth corps organizations. The legislation would help ensure that graduating students are trained to live, work, and lead in a world increasingly impacted by climate change. “The young students of today will be the climate leaders of tomorrow, and we must arm them with knowledge to understand and fight back against climate change,” said Senator Markey. “We teach math and reading to prepare our students for their future, and we should help our schools teach them about the impacts of, and solutions for, climate change to protect that future. The Climate Change Education Act demonstrates our commitment to placing climate education front and center in our nation’s education system.” \\xa0“We cannot fully confront the existential threat of climate change without a thorough understanding of the impact it will have on our lives and the steps we must take to combat it. Students learning these lessons today will be on the frontlines of the fight to save our planet. With this legislation, we will ensure our students and teachers are equipped with the knowledge and support they need to help us address this challenge today and in the future,” said Congresswoman Dingell. The Climate Change Education Act would support climate literacy by authorizing $50 million per year between fiscal years 2025 and 2030 for grants and cooperative agreements between NOAA and education entities. In line with the Biden administration’s Justice40 Initiative, the bill stipulates that 40 percent of the funds for higher education institutions and youth corps organizations would be directed to environmental justice communities.\\xa0 Original co-sponsors of the legislation in the Senate include Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Laphonza Butler (D-Calif.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Richard Durbin (D-Ill.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.). The legislation is endorsed by the Campaign for Environmental Literacy, the American Federation of Teachers, the National Wildlife Federation, the National Education Association, the North American Association for Environmental Education, the U.S. Green Building Council, Second Nature, the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education, and Earthday.org. “This new act will apply the scientific and grantmaking expertise and resources of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to giving the next generation the knowledge and skills it must have to tackle climate change through a deeper understanding of its causes, consequences and solutions,” said James Elder, Director of the Campaign for Environmental Literacy. “Our students are aware that climate change is happening and intensifying,” said Randi Weingarten, American Federation of Teachers President. “They are active advocates calling on our leaders to address climate change because they—and generations after them—will have to navigate the effects on their lives, future jobs and changing environment. It is our duty as educators to build students’ understanding of the climate crisis and prepare them for jobs and civic engagement in a world affected by climate change. Sen. Ed Markey and Rep. Debbie Dingell’s bill does just that through offering grants so schools can invest in climate education and hands-on learning opportunities. With these programs, we can work to educate the next generation to be significantly more aware of the climate crisis and what to do about it.” “We can’t solve the climate crisis in one generation. Students need the tools and resources necessary to learn about climate change to create resilient solutions and adapt with the changing needs of our planet,” said Kim Martinez, Vice President of Education and Engagement at National Wildlife Federation. “This bill addresses the critical gap in climate education and would provide hands-on learning, mentoring, and skill development opportunities to ensure the next generation succeeds in stewarding the environment into the future.” “From greater exposure to pollution to greater vulnerability to extreme weather, Black, Latino, Indigenous, and other communities of color, low-income communities, people with disabilities, and under-resourced urban and rural communities bear the greatest burdens from negative climate impacts. As our country continues to face the increasing consequences of climate change, climate literacy is critically important,” said Becky Pringle, President of the National Education Association. “The Climate Change Education Act will not only help our nation’s students learn more about the causes, consequences, and solutions to climate change, but it also will be instrumental in allowing opportunities for educators to have the tools and professional learning they need to prepare their students for the changing planet. We are grateful for Senator Markey’s continued leadership on this important legislation that will make a difference for students, educators, and their communities.” “NAAEE applauds the introduction of the Climate Change Education Act,\" said Sarah Bodor, Director of Policy for the North American Association for Environmental Education. \"This bill would provide much needed resources to schools and communities who understand the importance of teaching students about climate change and climate solutions but lack the tools and training to do so effectively.” “Climate and environmental education is the key to entrepreneurism, innovation, jobs, climate security, and climate equity,” said Kathleen Rogers, President of Earthday.org. “We support this legislation as a step in the right direction.” “Educating our students about climate change is a critical step to reach the scale of action necessary to change the trajectory of damage to our planet and ecosystems,” said Anisa Heming, Director of the Center for Green Schools at the U.S. Green Building Council. “We are proud to support the Climate Change Education Act and applaud Senator Markey and Representative Dingell for their continued leadership in providing necessary resources to communities, schools, and teachers in their efforts to educate their students.” ###',\n",

Markey (D-Mass.) today released his tenth episode of the “The Ed Markey Podcast,” featuring Sara Nelson, President of the Association Flight Attendants-CWA, AFL-CIO. The two discussed the risks that climate change poses to workers, how the Green New Deal can deliver good-paying, union jobs, and the importance of organizing and movement building for environmental justice and climate action. “My father was the Vice President of a union up in Boston—U.E. And it's 1944, and here's the President's State of the Union address and he's saying, ‘actually, you know, when the war is over, we are going to need a strategy in order to deal with all these returning veterans and for every family in our country,’” said Senator Markey. “And Senator Joe McCarthy, he thought the U.E. was a kind of a communist union and they were trying to undermine the country. But in fact, all they were doing was expressing the aspirations which every family has for itself. And that's what unions actually provide.” Every Friday until Earth Day next week, “The Ed Markey Podcast” will feature a new episode with a variety of climate champions—from lawmakers to youth organizers and environmental justice activists. “The Ed Markey Podcast” spotlights how the Green New Deal movement has transformed the United States’ national climate agenda by creating new union jobs, delivering long-overdue justice, and reducing dangerous pollution. Senator Markey and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (NY-14) recently unveiled a new report, “Five Years of the Green New Deal,” detailing what the Green New Deal means for good-paying clean jobs, environmental justice, and climate action, and providing a path forward for years to come. ###\",\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON, DC – Today, the Biden Administration finalized strict limits on certain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), also known as “forever chemicals,” in drinking water that will require utilities to reduce them to the lowest level they can be reliably measured.\\xa0 The new rule will further protect public health by requiring water systems to monitor and abate PFAS contamination. This is the first time the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set a drinking water standard for a new contaminant since 1996.\\xa0 Some states – including Rhode Island, Maine, and Massachusetts – have already passed drinking water standards for certain PFAS.\\xa0 According to the EPA, water contaminated with PFAS – which doesn’t degrade in the environment – has potential health risks including links to decreased fertility and high blood pressure in women, developmental delays in children, increased risk of testicular, kidney, and prostate cancer, as well as decreased immune system function and hormonal imbalances. U.S. Senator Jack Reed welcomed the Biden Administration taking bold action to protect Americans from harmful exposure to forever chemicals in their drinking water.\\xa0 Reed, a member of the Appropriations Committee, also noted that the Biden Administration is making $1 billion in federal funding available to help water systems to monitor, treat, and abate PFAS contamination.\\xa0 This funding comes directly from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (P.L. 117-58), that Senator Reed helped pass in 2021, which allocates $50 billion to improve America’s water quality and wastewater and stormwater infrastructure. The final rule announced today will be phased in and is projected to reduce PFAS exposure for approximately 100 million people, improving public health and reducing tens of thousands of serious illnesses. Senator Reed stated: “Every American should be able to turn on their tap and access clean, safe drinking water.\\xa0 Today, the Biden Administration is taking a bold, historic step to protect public health and curtail PFAS chemicals in our drinking water.\\xa0 These tougher standards will reduce contaminants in our drinking water.\\xa0 I am committed to ensuring Rhode Island municipalities and drinking water providers can meet these tough national PFAS limits.\\xa0 Indeed, Rhode Island already has a head start because the state passed its own PFAS restrictions in 2022 and has already begun working to limit forever chemicals in our water supply.\\xa0 This new federal rule comes with additional federal resources to pay for enhanced water treatment systems.\\xa0 Since 2022, my colleagues in the delegation and I have already helped direct nearly $200 million to Rhode Island for water infrastructure projects.\\xa0 Federal, state, and local officials and water utilities must work together to effectively address PFAS and I will ensure the federal government is a reliable partner in this endeavor.” Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances are a class of chemicals often used to make products resist water, stains, and heat and were used at one point in many common household items.\\xa0 Manufacturer 3M recently agreed to pay more than $10 billion to drinking water providers to settle PFAS litigation. At the state level, Rhode Island passed a law in 2022 requiring all community water systems to test their drinking supplies for PFAS and report the results to the state Department of Health (DOH).\\xa0 Under that state law, if a community reports a level of PFAS contamination over 20 parts per trillion, it is required to issue public advisories to customers and enter into an agreement with DOH outlining how it will lower the level of PFAS in their water. To help address PFAS cleanup efforts near military installations, Senator Reed helped authorize more than $500 million for PFAS cleanup across the military services in the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and ensure the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does its part to study human health impacts from PFAS in drinking water sources.',\n",
       " 'PORTSMOUTH, RI – The picturesque Mount Hope Bridge between Bristol and Portsmouth will soon see major updates thanks to new federal funding. In an effort to ensure the safety of the Mount Hope Bridge and save taxpayers money in repairs down the road, U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse today hailed a new $17 million Promoting Resilient Operations for Transformative, Efficient and Cost-Saving Transportation (PROTECT) grant for the Rhode Island Turnpike and Bridge Authority (RITBA) to make needed investments in the Mount Hope Bridge which, coupled with a $10 million federal earmark Reed and Whitehouse secured for the Mount Hope Bridge in the Fiscal Year 2023 Consolidated Appropriations law (P.L. 117-328), will help fund the installation of a dehumidification system on the steel wires, cables, and anchors of the Mount Hope Bridge. Due to the age of the bridge and corrosion from the elements, the 700-ton cables that support the majority of Mount Hope Bridge’s weight have been weakened by cumulative corrosion and moisture. Investing these federal funds in repairs to the historic suspension bridge and the protective dehumidification system will make the Mount Hope Bridge safer and could save taxpayers tenfold by preventing costlier damage in the future. Built in 1929, the Mount Hope Bridge — which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places — is one of only three connections from the mainland to Aquidneck Island, and the sole connection from the East Bay.\\xa0 The two-lane suspension bridge serves as a critical freight corridor connecting coastal Rhode Island to southeastern Massachusetts, Boston, and points north and west in the nation’s highway system.\\xa0 The Mount Hope Bridge carries an estimated 7 million motorists per year, according to RITBA, a quasi-state agency responsible for the operation and maintenance of Rhode Island’s four major bridges. “Our bridges are lifelines that connect communities and we’ve got to keep them in good working order.\\xa0 Age, deterioration from the elements, and every day wear and tear can take a real toll on our bridges.\\xa0 This is a smart investment in keeping this 95-year old bridge in good working order, ensuring its safety and soundness for future generations, and putting people to work in good-paying jobs in the construction trades,” said Senator Reed.\\xa0 “I was pleased to work with Senator Whitehouse to earmark federal funds and help secure PROTECT grant funds for this project.\\xa0 Long before the westbound Washington Bridge went offline, Senator Whitehouse has been out in front on the need to invest in our bridges and do preventative maintenance, particularly on the Mount Hope Bridge.\\xa0 This federal funding will help harden our bridge infrastructure and make the Mount Hope Bridge more resilient to the impacts of climate change.” “As the majestic Mount Hope Bridge nears its century mark, the Bridge is in urgent need of significant upgrades to protect the integrity of its cables from rising temperatures, moisture, and humidity caused by climate change.\\xa0 I’ve advocated extensively for this Mount Hope Bridge funding to prevent another massive disruption for Rhode Islanders, which would be triggered by further deterioration of the cables.\\xa0 Senator Reed has been an excellent partner on the Appropriations Committee as we have worked to prepare Rhode Island’s critical infrastructure for climate change and take preventive steps to keep the Mount Hope Bridge online,” said Senator Whitehouse, who helped create the PROTECT Grant program as a senior member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.\\xa0 “This investment follows the $82.5 million grant we secured to extend the life of the Pell Bridge, which was awarded from the INFRA Program I helped create.” In 2021, RITBA issued a report on bridge inspections between 1960 and 2000 showing that 744 wires on the bridge had broken out of 2,450.\\xa0 While most of those were repaired over the years, the report highlighted that the entire bridge could be compromised if the cables were allowed to deteriorate without fixes.\\xa0 The $27 million in federal funding will help keep the bridge cables in a state of good repair and significantly improve the resilience of this key connection.\\xa0 RITBA officials have previously estimated that replacing the cables would cost over $500 million. “We are so grateful to Senator Reed and Senator Whitehouse for their relentless advocacy and support of Rhode Island’s bridges,” said Lori Caron Silveira, Executive Director of the Rhode Island Turnpike and Bridge Authority.\\xa0 “Maintaining these bridges is critical for the communities that rely on them, and we appreciate that Senator Reed and Senator Whitehouse understand the unique needs of our infrastructure.”\\xa0\\xa0 RITBA began doing cable air flow testing earlier this year as part of the Mount Hope Dehumidification Project, which is part of a multi-year project to upgrade the bridge.\\xa0 The cable dehumidification technology that RITBA is using has been successfully employed in other major bridges in the U.S., including the Delaware Memorial Bridge and the South Tenth Street Bridge in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. According to Structure magazine: “Main cable dehumidification involves injecting dried-air into the cable microenvironment and allowing the air to permeate into the interstitial spaces (voids) between the individual cable-wires.\\xa0 The dried-air collects the trapped water before releasing the moisture-laden air through exhaust ports (Figure 1).\\xa0 Cable dehumidification addresses the root cause of corrosion by removing one of the two necessary components of the corrosion process – water – which is far easier than removing the other component – oxygen. “The premise of cable dehumidification is to protect the individual cable wires through the control of humidity within the cable.\\xa0 This is a long-proven technique dating back to the first half of the twentieth century, where work was carried out by W.H.J. Vernon and later by H.H. Uhlig of the MIT Corrosion Laboratory.\\xa0 The results of corrosion studies indicate that if the relative humidity (RH) is kept below 60%, the corrosion rate dramatically decreases, and below 40%, corrosion practically ceases (Figure 2).”',\n",

Click\\xa0here\\xa0to download audio.*** “Few things are more frustrating in government than unelected bureaucrats asserting authority they don’t have and foisting federal mediocrity on the excellence of states,”\\xa0said Cramer.\\xa0“The Senate will take up my bipartisan resolution that overturns the Biden administration’s obviously illegal rule that requires state departments of transportation to measure CO2 tailpipe emissions then set declining targets for vehicles traveling on the highway systems of their perspective states.”\\xa0 “The Federal Highway Administration provided a very novel rationale,”\\xa0added Cramer.\\xa0“They argued that since Congress was aware of their plans to promulgate this rule, and did not explicitly bar it, ‘Congress intended to leave such determinations to agency expertise to be handled via regulatory authority.’ That's not just arrogance, that is arrogance on steroids. […]\\xa0 The Biden administration should have never introduced this rule. But now we, the policymaking branch of government, must end it. I urge all my colleagues to stand up for the Senate and vote for this restoration of Article One powers.”  Congress has not provided the DOT with any statutory authority to implement this proposal. It was thoroughly debated and intentionally left out of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. FHWA’s new rule resembles a 2017 Obama administration\\xa0rule\\xa0which\\xa0the Trump administration\\xa0repealed\\xa0in 2018 after reconsidering the legal authority under which it was promulgated.\\xa0Recently, two federal courts issued\\xa0decisions\\xa0against the rule, reiterating Congress never gave the Executive Branch this authority.\\xa0 “Colleagues, the absence of a prohibition is not a license for the bureaucracy to do whatever it pleases. These court rulings underscore agencies must abide by the law, not invent the authority they desire,”\\xa0said Cramer.\\xa0“Several states have resoundingly rejected this illegal rule. Several state departments of transportation objected to it in writing, and several states joined this litigation and 50 senators have cosponsored this Congressional Review Act.” Additionally, the agency’s proposal is not workable, as illustrated by comments from a majority of state DOTs and attorneys general, which raised concerns or outright opposed it. “If the people, through Congress, believe that the states should spend the time and money necessary to measure and report GHG emissions and set declining emission targets, they may do so by amending Section 150 or passing a new law. But an agency cannot make this decision for the people. An agency can only do what the people authorize it to do, and the plain language of Section 150(c)(3) and its related statutory provisions demonstrate the DOT was not authorized to enact the 2023 Rule,”\\xa0said Judge James Wesley Hendrix of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas. “If the Administrator were allowed to shove national greenhouse-gas policy into the mouths of uncooperative state Departments of Transportation, this would corrupt the separation of sovereigns central to our lasting and vibrant system of federalism. Neither the Constitution nor the Administrative Procedure Act authorizes administrative ventriloquism,”\\xa0said Judge Benjamin Beaton of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky. Over the past year, Senator Cramer has engaged in numerous efforts to prevent the Biden administration from finalizing this mandate. In December 2023,\\xa0he penned an op-ed in the\\xa0Wall Street Journal\\xa0highlighting FHWA’s\\xa0lack of statutory authority to issue the rule, and stressed its unworkable nature for rural states.

The\\xa0new rule undermines\\xa0the franchise business model by forcing liability on companies for another business’ employees, even if they do not directly manage them. Additionally,\\xa0it creates\\xa0uncertainty among small and local businesses as to their legal liabilities,\\xa0leading to higher operational costs and less opportunity to create jobs. North Dakota is home to 2,338 franchise locations,\\xa0employing\\xa0nearly 25,000 people.\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0 For over 25 years, a company could only be considered a joint employer if they have “direct and immediate” management over another business’ employees. The Obama administration\\xa0changed\\xa0this\\xa0in 2015 and forced companies to be liable for another business’ employees if they held “indirect” and “reserved” control over their workers. The 2015 rule cost franchises an estimated\\xa0$33 billion\\xa0each year, 376,000 job losses, and expensive litigations. In 2020, the Trump administration\\xa0returned\\xa0to the longstanding “direct and immediate” standard, providing liability relief to businesses.

Res.98, a\\xa0Congressional Review Act (CRA)\\xa0resolution\\xa0of disapproval to overturn the NLRB’s new joint\\xa0employer rule.\\xa0 The resolution passed the Senate by a vote of\\xa050 to 48. “This rule, crafted by out-of-touch D.C. bureaucrats, would negatively impact millions of workers and thousands of businesses if left in place,”\\xa0said Cramer.\\xa0“It represents\\xa0another attempt by this administration to pursue unnecessary and costly regulation, at the expense of our nation’s workers and economy. Today’s vote repeals this egregious rule and protects the franchise business model in America.”\\xa0 North Dakota\\xa0businesses like Anytime Fitness and Great Clips are directly impacted by this rule, and applauded Senator Cramer’s efforts to overturn it. “I am thankful that Senator Cramer is working to stand up for my franchise business and the\\xa02,000 franchise businesses across the state.

The final joint employer rule is as unworkable as it is impractical,”\\xa0said Emily Wilcox, North Dakota Great Clips franchisee.\\xa0“This rule would remove the independence of small business owners like me and turn us into mid-level managers. Local franchise owners pour our heart and soul into our businesses, employees, and communities -- and now Washington is meddling in our affairs to satisfy their special interest allies. Thank you, Senator Cramer and all the other elected officials, willing to stand up for the franchise model before it’s too late.”\\xa0\\xa0 In December 2022, Senator Cramer joined U.S. Senator Mike Braun (R-IN) and 42 Senate Republicans in a\\xa0letter\\xa0to NLRB Chairman Lauren McFerran opposing the proposed joint employer rule, and in September 2022, he sent a letter to the NLRB raising concerns about their efforts to modify the existing joint employer standard.

On His Next Legislative Focus After the Senate’s Passage of His CRA: “I think it's permitting reform quite honestly.

Let's get some permitting reform that allows us to build out the type of infrastructure we need for gas powered cars, and electric generation and moving that electric generation distributing it to\\xa0market.” On Federal Courts: “I think we're going to have more of these types of fights where federalism is actually on the floor, where the overreach of the federal government into the powers of the states and the powers of the elected officials is stymied both by Congress, but also by courts. Remember, this success I had yesterday in overturning the Biden rule on […] greenhouse gas emissions measurements, that\\xa0was just one of many of these fights where this court. That\\xa0has been really developed by Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell over the last few years, not just the Supreme Court, but other courts have been very clear with using the major questions doctrine, […] a lack of a prohibition is not licensed for a federal agency to do whatever they want. Same with the Waters of the United States, return power to states. Now, the Supreme Court's going to take up a Chevron Doctrine case. All of this is slowly turning the ship of the Constitution back in line with what the founders had in mind.” On Excessive Green Energy Subsidies Under Biden Administration: “I love the idea of impoundment, Larry, but we need to take a look at all of this tax policy that provides these subsidies and these credits, to everybody's favorite type of energy. The production tax credit for wind, for example, has been around for over 30 years. […] I'm not completely against early technologies, or emerging technologies that need a boost in the early stages that have promise, but these early investments become permanent investments and they just become pigs at the trough and then they compete with efficient energy like coal generated, and natural gas generated, and nuclear generated electricity.” \\nTags: \\nEnergy and the Environment\\n\",\n",
       " 'BISMARCK – While federal law routinely penalizes recidivist child exploitation offenders for their crimes, a loophole in the existing Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) fails to sufficiently discipline repeated child exploitation offenders with prior military convictions. To close this significant loophole, U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) joined U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) in cosponsoring his Parity\\xa0for Child Exploitation Offenders Act\\xa0to ensure enhanced sentencing for defendants with prior federal, state, or military convictions related to sex or child sexual exploitation. A companion measure was\\xa0introduced\\xa0the House by U.S. Representatives Claudia Tenney (R-NY-24) and Deborah Ross (D-NC-02). “Protecting our children, the most vulnerable and innocent members of society, is our most fundamental duty. Regrettably,\\xa0existing laws contain\\xa0unacceptable loopholes which\\xa0fail to adequately penalize offenders of\\xa0child exploitation crimes,”\\xa0said Cramer.\\xa0“Effectively\\xa0addressing these gaps will ensure that repeat offenders of child exploitation, sentenced under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, are held accountable and judged by the same standards as those without prior military convictions. I look forward to working\\xa0further\\xa0with my colleagues to pass this legislation and ensure the safety of all children.” “Those convicted of multiple child pornography and related offenses should face increased sentences. Ensuring that this loophole is closed is long overdue, and it is with great pride that I introduce this legislation with bipartisan and bicameral support. We must continue to work hard against the great evil of sexual abuse, especially relating to minors,”\\xa0said Senator Rubio. The Parity\\xa0for Child Exploitation Offenders Act proposes amendments to several statutes under Title 18 of the U.S. Code to ensure repeated military offenders receive enhanced sentencing when compared to their civilian counter parts. Upon implementation, bill would also address the disparity in sentencing for child pornography-related offenses under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which were previously excluded from enhanced sentencing provisions. Additional cosponsors include U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Mike Lee (R-UT), Angus King (I-ME), Mike Braun (R-IN), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Ted Budd (R-NC), Catherine Cortez-Masto (D-NV), Katie Britt (R-AL), John Fetterman (D-PA), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Susan Collins (R-ME), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), and Bob Casey (D-PA).

By extending the nationwide sale of E15, the letter notes this could add billions of gallons of ethanol to the fuel supply at a time domestic inventories of crude oil and petroleum products are at their lowest point since May 2004.

Under the Biden Administration, we passed and signed into law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the first significant gun violence prevention legislation passed in nearly three decades. And now, thanks to the President’s leadership, we are taking action to reduce the number of firearms sold without background checks. These common sense solutions will help save lives. “I am especially proud to see that the new rule includes action to close the firesale loophole, which has been a priority of mine. The fireseale loophole allows federally licensed firearm dealers whose licenses are revoked to transfer their inventory to their personal collections, allowing them to sell those firearms without conducting background checks. Closing this dangerous loophole will help keep deadly weapons out of the wrong hands.” The Department of Justice’s final rule implements the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act—the largest expansion of background checks since the Brady Bill became law.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The final rule makes clear when a person needs to become a licensed dealer and run background checks, and gives the Department of Justice additional tools to crack down on individuals illegally selling guns without background checks. Specifically, the final rule: Since his early days in public service, Booker has seen the devastating impact of gun violence first-hand. He is the only Senator who goes home to a low-income community that is disproportionately affected by violent crime caused by the easy availability of guns. As a result, Booker has been a forceful advocate for common-sense gun safety laws during his time in the Senate. He first introduced the Federal Firearm Licensing Act in 2019 and the Fire Sale Loophole Closing Act in 2022. He has also introduced the groundbreaking Break the Cycle of Violence Act that would provide federal grants to communities for evidence-based gun violence intervention and joined colleagues in introducing an Assault Weapons Ban. He was also a part of a bipartisan group of 20 Senators who signed on to a framework outlining the proposal to address the gun violence epidemic that resulted in the passage of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act in 2022.\\xa0\\xa0',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ), John Kennedy (R-LA), Ed Markey (D-MA), and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) introduced the Samaritan Efforts to Ensure Key Health Emergency and Life-saving Protections Act (SEEK HELP Act), a bipartisan bill that would provide limited legal protections to individuals who administer naloxone or other FDA-approved opioid reversal drugs to save a life in the event of an overdose. The bill also directs federal government resources towards raising public awareness about these life-saving protections. Drug overdose deaths in our nation have continued to soar to unprecedented levels, exceeding 112,000 for the first time within a 12-month span in 2023. Research has shown fear of police involvement and the possibility of facing criminal charges is cited as one of the most common reasons people avoid calling 9-1-1 to get assistance when they experience or witness a drug overdose. To address this problem, over 40 states have enacted Good Samaritan laws to provide limited criminal immunity to those who call emergency assistance to save an overdose victim. According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), these laws have been effective in curbing overdose deaths, but their impact is limited due to lack of public awareness. There is currently no federal Good Samaritan statute or substantial government investment in raising awareness about these laws. The SEEK HELP Act would fill this void and bring our nation one step closer to ensuring that no American dies simply because they or their loved ones are afraid to seek help. “The drug overdose crisis is ravaging communities across the nation, and far too many Americans have lost their lives as a tragic consequence. We can and must do more,\" said Senator Booker. \"I\\'m proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation to help combat this crisis, protect those seeking to help others, and ultimately save more lives.\" “In 2022 alone, about 1,400 Louisianians lost their lives to opioid\\xa0overdoses,” said Senator Kennedy. “The SEEK Help Act would get more Americans the life-saving treatment they need when they fall victim to an opioid overdose, and the Senate should pass it immediately.” “The SEEK HELP Act expands public health and community oriented approaches to preventing drug overdose. I’m grateful to my colleagues, Senators Booker and Kennedy, for attacking the opioid crisis head-on with me. This legislation is critical to our communities who have suffered because of illicit fentanyl and opioids. I am proud to lead with strategies that will build community trust and ensure people receive urgent services during overdose,” said Senator Markey.  The SEEK HELP Act would: The SEEK HELP Act is endorsed by the following organizations: Americans for Prosperity, Association of Prosecution Attorneys, Due Process Institute, Law Enforcement Action Partnership, National District Attorneys Association, R Street Institute, and Vera Institute. \"The SEEK HELP Act is a significant stride in our battle against the opioid epidemic,\" said Nelson Bunn, Executive Director of the National District Attorneys Association. \"With its provision of legal protections during overdose situations and efforts to raise awareness of Good Samaritan Laws, this legislation not only saves lives but also strengthens trust between law enforcement and communities. Ultimately, the SEEK HELP Act enhances public safety and fosters healthier, more resilient communities.\" “By raising public awareness of Good Samaritan laws and preventing any hesitation in using life-saving medical services, The SEEK HELP Act would prevent overdose deaths and increase community safety,” said David LaBahn, President of the Association for Prosecuting Attorneys. “This furthers our\\xa0mission to help prosecutors create safer communities through a more just and equitable legal system.\" \"Over a hundred thousand Americans are dying each year from a drug overdose. We must explore innovative policies that save lives and reduce the use of illicit substances in our country,\" said Greg Glod, Policy Fellow at Americans for Prosperity. \"Good Samaritan laws have shown great promise at reducing drug overdose deaths in the 48 states that have them in place. The SEEK HELP Act is an example of commonsense federal legislation that can save lives and empower our hard-working law enforcement officers and prosecutors to focus on threats to public safety.\"\\xa0\\xa0 “When someone calls 911 to save another person’s life during a drug overdose, they should expect immediate help—not prosecution and potential jail or prison time,” said Marta Nelson, Director of Sentencing Reform at the Vera Institute of Justice. “The drug crisis in our country is a consequence of failing to implement the right approach by continuing to criminalize and punish people experiencing addiction. Instead, we should incentivize people who witness or experience an overdose to reach out for help without fear of criminal or civil consequences, as the SEEK HELP Act does. We should also invest our resources in more access to treatment, overdose prevention centers, and fentanyl test strips. With this approach, we can work to prevent another year of more than 100,000 deaths from overdose in this country” “The R Street Institute supports the SEEK HELP Act in its efforts to increase the public’s awareness of Good Samaritan laws and are encouraged by the bill\\'s inclusion of federal immunity protections,” Mazen Saleh, Policy Director, Integrated Harm Reduction at R Street Institute. “We hope state laws follow suit.

This long-term extension would offer businesses the certainty they need to increase investment in sub-Saharan Africa at a time when many firms are looking to diversify supply chains away from China. Sub-Saharan Africa is home to the world’s youngest population and many fast-growing economies, and AGOA has played a critical role in advancing economic development and strengthening U.S. economic engagement in the region. “Over the past 24 years, AGOA has created jobs and economic growth in one of the fastest-growing regions of the world and created investment opportunities for American businesses,” said Senator Coons. “The AGOA Renewal and Improvement Act is necessary to support continued economic development on the continent while further strengthening ties between the United States and partners in sub-Saharan Africa.”\\xa0 “AGOA plays a significant role in U.S.-sub-Saharan Africa trade and investment, as well as in U.S. foreign policy.

       " 'Today, U.S. Representative Matt Cartwright (PA-08) introduced a pair of bills to help ensure accountability and save taxpayers millions by addressing and preventing “zombie mines,” idled modern-era mines that have not been cleaned up by irresponsible coal companies. The\\xa0Coal Cleanup Taxpayer Protection Act, co-led by Congresswoman Debbie Dingell (MI-06), will help ensure coal companies restore mine lands across the country to their original state after mining operations cease. \\xa0 The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA) was supposed to ensure that mines would not be abandoned without sufficient funding available to clean up and reclaim them. Typically, these funds would be made available in the form of bonds provided by the mine operator as part of the initial permitting process. If the mine operator failed and did not restore a mine to usable land, the bond would be forfeited, providing the state with enough money to cover the cost of cleanup.  However, loopholes within SMCRA have allowed too many mine operators to fail to put down bonds equal to cleanup costs. This means coal mine operators have been able to avoid responsibility and costs required for cleaning up their mines once those mines are closed.  Cartwright’s\\xa0Coal Cleanup Taxpayer Protection Act eliminates reckless self-bonding practices and requires operators to put down the full cost required for cleanup of their mines. Currently, self-bonding allows coal companies to promise to cover these cleanup costs without putting up sureties or collateral, leaving regulators with little to no recourse if a coal company goes bankrupt and forcing the American people to fund unfinished cleanup efforts. The bill also tightens rules on other types of bonding that have been shown to leave taxpayers paying for cleanup costs. “We’ve seen way too many coal companies file for bankruptcy and break their promise to clean up mine sites after they’ve made their profits, leaving the American people on the hook to foot the bill,” said Congressman Cartwright, a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee.\\xa0“These idled and abandoned mines also prevent economic development and pose environmental dangers.” “If you build it, it should be your responsibility to take it down and clean it up,” said Congresswoman Dingell. “Non-operating, defunct mines continue to negatively impact our water, air and lakes, and it shouldn’t be on the taxpayer to foot the bill to clean up these sites. I’m glad to join Congressman Cartwright to introduce the Coal Cleanup Taxpayer Protection Act to put an end to this harmful practice.” This legislation is endorsed by the Alliance for Appalachia, Appalachian Citizens’ Law Center, Appalachian Voices, Citizens Coal Council, Earthjustice, Eastern Pennsylvania Coalition for Abandoned Mine Reclamation (EPCAMR), Friends of the Cheat, National Wildlife Federation, Powder River Basin Resource Council, Sierra Club,\\xa0The Lands Council, Western Colorado Alliance for Community Action, Western Organization of Resource Councils (WORC),\\xa0and the West Virginia Rivers Coalition. “The whole idea of self-bonding, as it stands today, is a loophole and a farce,”\\xa0said Bob LeResche, board member of the Powder River Basin Resource Council and the Western Organization of Resource Councils.\\xa0“We appreciate Congressman Cartwright’s efforts to\\xa0 \\xa0prepare for coal company bankruptcies and the permanent closure of coal mines by tightening the rules for self-bonding. Coal companies should not be allowed to offload mine cleanup costs onto taxpayers and states.” Full text of the bill can be found here.  Cartwright’s Bond Improvement and Reclamation Assurance Act, also introduced today, goes one step further in tackling bonding issues by requiring regulators to consider important financial and environmental factors when calculating and recalculating bond amounts, specifically: \\xa0\\xa0 ·\\xa0 anticipated length of mine operations; \\xa0\\xa0 ·\\xa0 inflation rates; \\xa0\\xa0 ·\\xa0 long-term water pollution treatment needs; \\xa0\\xa0 ·\\xa0 anticipated coal market conditions; \\xa0\\xa0 ·\\xa0 the cost of reclamation if performed by the regulatory authority. This legislation is endorsed by the Alliance for Appalachia, Appalachian Citizens\\' Law Center (ACLC), Appalachian Voices, Powder River Basin, Sierra Club and Western Organization of Resource Councils (WORC). \"In the last few years in Kentucky, we\\'ve seen several mine permits abandoned by the coal operator with inadequate bond amounts,” said Rebecca Sheldon, director of Policy for the ACLC. “We’re so grateful for Congressman Cartwright\\'s leadership in ensuring that mines have reclamation bonds that are sufficient to cover the costs of cleanup. Our regions deserve clean water and reclaimed land so that we can live safely and transition these sites into new opportunities.\" \"We applaud Congressman Cartwright\\'s dedication and leadership to ensure that coal mines are cleaned up, and to ensure that taxpayers aren\\'t paying for coal mining reclamation,” said Chelsea Barnes, director of Government Affairs and Strategy for Appalachian Voices.\\xa0 “Everyone deserves to have clean water and to be safe in their homes; the Congressman\\'s bills are crucial measures to ensure coal companies aren\\'t leaving mining communities to deal with their messes.\" ',\n",
       " ' TUCSON, Ariz. – Today, the Biden administration issued the first-ever national, legally enforceable drinking water standard to protect communities from exposure to harmful per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), also known as ‘forever chemicals. \\xa0PFAS chemicals are estimated to potentially contaminate the drinking water of more than 200 million Americans, and the severe health impacts, including reproductive and developmental effects, are still not fully understood. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also announced nearly\\xa0$1 billion in newly available funding\\xa0through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, supported by Rep.

I’ve long called for enforceable standards to protect the public’s health and supply of drinking water, and today, President Biden delivered. This historic action will protect communities and provide enforcement to make certain that drinking water is safe around the country.” “While I appreciate the Biden administration’s commitment to investing in drinking water infrastructure upgrades, environmental justice, and our collective public health, it’s critical that public water systems across our nation work urgently to exceed the established timelines. We must continue to prioritize protecting Americans from these chemicals and it will require a sustained federal response.

Grijalva. “By closing this decades-old loophole, our communities will be safer from the scourge of gun violence. We must continue to push for common sense gun reforms like universal background checks and a national ban on assault weapons Now is time to build on our progress and have the political courage to protect the children of this nation – full stop.” Previously, only sellers “engaged in the business” of firearm dealing were required to register as a Federal firearm licensee (FFL) and therefore conduct background checks for firearm sales. Today’s rule expands the definition of “engaged in the business” of dealing firearms to anyone who sells firearms to earn a profit, greatly expanding the number of firearms dealers legally required to register as FFLs. Firearms sellers previously operating without running background checks will be obligated to perform them before selling a firearm to a buyer. This rule was made possible by the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the most consequential gun violence prevention legislation signed into law in decades which Rep. Grijalva was proud to help pass.

       " 'WASHINGTON – Today, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), announced $300 million in direct funding through the Shelter and Services Program (SSP), which was authorized by Congress to support communities that are providing services to asylum seekers.\\xa0Arizona will receive $54.5 million in SSP funding in DHS’ first tranche of allocations. Rep. Grijalva and Stanton sent a letter on March 22, 2024 urging for the immediate allocation of funding and requested that border communities on the front lines of the crisis are prioritized. “I appreciate the Biden administration’s swiftness to allocate this federal funding to Arizona. I will continue to work with federal, state, local, and non-governmental organizations to ensure this funding is distributed expeditiously. As Southern Arizona communities continue to deal with the humanitarian crisis, it’s critical we provide them with the resources and funding they need,” said Rep. Grijalva. “It’s clear that the only path forward to address these issues long-term is real immigration reform to fix our broken system beginning with humane solutions, increased legal pathways, dealing with root causes, and providing more resources and personnel at the border instead of Republicans’ detrimental funding cuts and failed enforcement-only policies.” “This funding couldn’t come soon enough. I’ve visited local aid groups along the border, and they’re near a breaking point—over-stretching their budgets to help care for migrant families and prevent street releases,” said Rep. Stanton. “I’ll keep working to make sure Arizona communities get their fair share of federal resources to manage this crisis.” The full funding amounts for Arizona can be found here. Additionally, the Department is announcing $340.9 million through the Shelter and Services Program-Competitive grant program to be allocated before the end of this Fiscal Year as well as $25 million to accommodate evolving operational needs. \\xa0The recent government funding package\\xa0passed in March 2024, provided $650 million for the SSP to reimburse local governments and non-profits for the care for migrants after their release into the U.S. – a decrease from $800 million last fiscal year.

       " 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Rep. Rick Larsen (WA-02) applauded House passage of the Migratory Birds of the Americas Conservation Enhancements Act, a bipartisan bill introduced by Reps. Larsen, Maria Elvira Salazar (FL-27), David Joyce (OH-14) and Mary Peltola (AK-At Large) to reauthorize and improve the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act (NMBCA), the only federal grant initiative to promote the conservation of migratory birds. The bill passed the House of Representatives by voice vote. Senators Ben Cardin (D-MD) and John Boozman (R-AR) have introduced similar legislation, which the Senate is expected to consider soon. For video of Larsen’s remarks on the House floor in support of the bill, click here. What Larsen and Stakeholders Are Saying “I am glad to see our migratory bird bill soar through the House! Pesticide pollution, deforestation and invasive species threaten the more than 350 migratory bird species that rely on the Pacific Northwest as their flyaway,\" said Larsen, the lead Democrat on the Transportation & Infrastructure Committee. \"This bipartisan bill will help protect these diverse bird populations and their habitats in the Pacific Northwest and across the Western Hemisphere and provide a significant boost to the outdoor economy.” “We have lost three billion birds since 1970—a staggering number—and this legislation is critically important to help communities and partners meet the challenges of the moment so we can conserve migratory birds for years to come,” said Marshall Johnson, chief conservation officer at the National Audubon Society. “96 million Americans engage in birdwatching, contributing $100 billion to the U.S. economy each year. Investing in migratory bird conservation across the hemisphere is essential to reversing these troubling bird declines. We thank the House and the co-sponsors of this bill for their leadership, and urge swift passage of the companion bill in the Senate.” \"North Cascades Audubon Society wholeheartedly thanks Rep. Rick Larsen for his leadership and efforts to reauthorize and enhance the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act,” said Robert Kaye, conservation chair at the North Cascades Audubon Society. “This crucial legislation will help protect the neotropical migratory birds that perform such an essential role in the health and well-being of the ecological systems as they journey throughout our hemisphere. Additionally, so much of our forests, lakes, streams, wetlands and marine habitats that are essential to the health of our local ecosystems, and to the survival of these transient birds, will greatly benefit from the protections incorporated into this essential reauthorization legislation.\" “As members of the Skagit Valley community, we understand the vital role that migratory birds play in our ecosystem and our economy,” said John Day, president of the Skagit Audubon Society. “Our valley is home to myriad migratory bird species that rely on the region\\'s wetlands, forests, and farmland as critical stopover and nesting sites during their long journeys. Skagit Audubon Society greatly appreciates the leadership of Rep. Rick Larsen for passing this legislation to increase investments in protecting birds across the hemisphere, helping to ensure that birds have the habitat they need to thrive, no matter where they are on their migratory journey.” What the Migratory Bird Bill Does Since 2002, the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act has awarded more than $89 million in grants to over 700 migratory bird conservation projects in the United States, Canada, Central and South America, and the Caribbean. Partner organizations have contributed an additional $346 million to these projects, which have protected more than 5 million acres of habitat in the Western Hemisphere.

       " 'Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Susan Collins, Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Katie Britt (R-AL), and Tina Smith (D-MN) announced the introduction of bipartisan legislation to provide support for rural health care facilities to provide urgent obstetric care. Their bill, the Rural Obstetrics Readiness Act, would help prepare rural hospitals and practitioners to handle the obstetric emergencies that come through their doors as more delivery units, particularly those in rural areas, are being forced into close. Between 2011 and 2021, more than 260 rural hospitals in the U.S. shut down their obstetrics services, representing one in four of the nation’s rural obstetric units. In Maine, almost one-third of hospitals in rural Maine have closed their obstetric units in the past 15 years. Nationally, this trend has left more than 2 million women in a maternity care desert, meaning that they live in a county without a provider offering obstetric care such as labor and delivery. This can lead to longer driving times for care and increased health risks. \"The closure of labor and delivery units in rural Maine and throughout the nation is an urgent issue that threatens the health and safety of mothers and\\xa0babies,\" said Senator Collins. \"By creating new opportunities to improve obstetric readiness in rural communities through skills training, workforce development, and telehealth partnerships, this bipartisan legislation would help reduce care gaps and better ensure that more rural Maine communities have access to the maternal care they need.” Specifically, the Rural Obstetrics Readiness Act would provide new opportunities for rural health care facilities to respond to obstetric emergencies by: The bill is endorsed by the National Rural Health Association, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American College of Emergency Physicians, American Academy of Family Practitioners, American Society of Anesthesiologists, and the Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs. Improving access to health care in rural areas has been a focus of Senator Collins’ efforts throughout her Senate service. In March, Senator Collins secured $2,397,000 in Congressionally Directed Spending for projects that will help to improve access to health care throughout Maine in the Fiscal Year 2024 (FY24) Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill.\\xa0 Congress has passed the bill, and the President has signed it into law.\\xa0 A one-pager on this legislation is available\\xa0here.

       " 'Washington, D.C. – Following the United States Postal Service’s (USPS) decision to convert the Eastern Maine plant in Hampden to a Local Processing Center, moving outgoing mail processing to Scarborough, U.S. Senator Susan Collins released the following statement: “This misguided decision, which I repeatedly urged the USPS to reject, jeopardizes the reliable delivery of mail, including critical medication, for Mainers,” Senator Collins wrote. “In addition, residents will certainly see their local mail delayed. These concerns are further heightened by the recent USPS IG report highlighting pre-existing delivery delays in Southern Maine. The USPS should reconsider this decision and be transparent with Mainers about its impact.” The Hampden facility is important for mail delivery across large parts of Maine. For example, mail currently sent from Fort Kent to Wallagrass, 10 miles away, is processed in Hampden, 192 miles away. It then returns the following day by truck to Wallagrass, which is 182 miles away. Under the new proposal, this mail would have to be transported to Scarborough, 322 miles away from Fort Kent, and then be sent at least another 312 miles back to Wallgrass. A highway mileage map of Maine can be found here. Senator Collins has long voiced her opposition to proposed changes to the postal network in Maine that could affect reliable mail service for Mainers. In November 2023, she penned a letter to Postmaster General Louis DeJoy objecting to the proposal to consolidate operations of Maine’s two USPS processing facilities, which USPS was considering as part of a study on operational efficiency.\\xa0 Senator Collins also provided comments for a public meeting on the proposal in February. Prior to this, Senator Collins wrote to Postmaster DeJoy several times, addressing concerns about delivery speed and workforce retention in Maine and across the national postal network. Additionally, she met with the USPS IG last fall to discuss their examination of Postal Service quality in Southern Maine. ###',\n",

Washington, D.C. – At a hearing to review the Fiscal Year 2025 budget request for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Senator Susan Collins, Vice Chair of the Appropriations Committee, called on Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas to help find a solution to staffing issues found at Maine’s ports that are threatening the arrival of international cruise ships in Eastport this fall.\\xa0 During the hearing, Senator Collins also highlighted her concern that the President’s budget request does not do enough to address the flood of illegal migrants and fentanyl entering the United States. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials recently informed the City of Eastport that the agency cannot accommodate the four planned international cruise ship arrivals this fall, even though CBP staffed a larger number of international cruise ship arrivals in Eastport last year, and Bar Harbor is seeing a reduction in international cruise ship arrivals. “The cruise ship industry is vital to many Maine communities and delivers millions in economic benefits to our state annually.\\xa0 This is the flip side of the problems that we're now seeing on the southwest border, creating also problems on the northeast border and northern border in general,” said Senator Collins.\\xa0 “Mr. Secretary, what I'm asking from you today is to look into this staffing issue and follow up with me, to try to resolve this problem.” “The Eastport Port Authority thanks Senator Susan Collins for taking the time to bring real issues, affecting real operations in our parts of the world to the forefront.\\xa0 To see a Cabinet Secretary have a hearing start off by being asked specifically about issues of our port, and our friends to the south in nearby Bar Harbor, shows that good representation matters,” said Chris Gardner, Executive Director for the Port of Eastport.\\xa0 “Let us hope this work lends itself to us to finding the solutions we need to continue to grow our port and continue to bring much needed economic activity to the entire region.” Last year, Senator Collins raised similar concerns to Secretary Mayorkas when CBP refused to provide services to an international ferry service between Bar Harbor and Nova Scotia unless the ferry service paid the full annual salaries of four CBP officials – even though the ferry only utilizes CBP services for a few months each year. ###\",\n",
       " 'The Blast Overpressure Safety Act Would Require Defense Department to Enact Better Blast Overpressure Screening, Tracking, Prevention, and Treatment  Bill Text (PDF) | One-Pager (PDF) Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Susan Collins, Vice Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee and Subcommittee on Defense, and Angus King, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC), are cosponsoring a bipartisan bill to better protect service members from the physical and cognitive dangers of shockwaves produced by explosive weapons used both in combat and in training. The Blast Overpressure Safety Act would direct the Department of Defense (DoD) to enact a range of measures to help mitigate and protect service members from blast overpressure. Blast overpressure is the pressure caused by a shockwave above normal atmospheric pressure and is most commonly caused by explosions or sonic booms. During just three months in 2023, DoD provided treatment to service members nearly 50,000 times for traumatic brain injuries (TBI), which are considered the “signature wound” of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. For troops with mild TBI, “the most important cause of brain injury was the long-term exposure to explosive weapons.” Researchers in Afghanistan also determined that, “75 percent of the troops’ [blast] exposure was coming from their own weapons.” Despite this, service members continue to train with weapons with unsafe blast levels.\\xa0 “Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is an all-too-often undetected or misdiagnosed condition that can have debilitating and tragic effects on our wounded servicemen and women. \\xa0If these injuries go undiagnosed or are left untreated, the consequences can be devastating,”\\xa0said Senator Collins.\\xa0“Our soldiers and veterans suffering from TBI as a result of their service deserve the best care and treatment our nation can provide. \\xa0This bipartisan legislation will help improve critical research, accurate diagnosis, and lifesaving treatment for these heroes who serve and defend our nation.” “Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) from explosive weapons — used both in the field and in training exercises — are common yet misunderstood, and they are affecting the health and quality of life of our service members and veterans. In Maine, we know all too well the horrible tragedies that can occur, like in Lewiston, when TBIs are left untreated,” said Senator King. “The Blast Overpressure Safety Act will ensure that we better protect our servicemembers from the dangerous shockwaves produced by explosive weapons, and step up efforts to measure and treat the harm that can be done. This bill is a long overdue, common-sense step forward to expand access to care for those with traumatic brain injuries caused by their time in service. We owe it to the Lewiston victims and their families to expand research, provide TBI care, and follow the data and science of preventable brain damage. It’s the least we can do, and I thank my colleagues from both sides of the aisle for their work to address this critical and preventable issue.” The bill is also endorsed by the Wounded Warrior Project.\\xa0 “Brain health plays a crucial role in many veterans’ overall quality of life.\\xa0 Head-related trauma, including traumatic brain injury (TBI), is sometimes referred to as the ‘signature injury’ for post-9/11 veterans due to the increased TBI prevalence among veterans of this generation.\\xa0Wounded Warrior Project’s (WWP’s) 2022 Annual Warrior Survey found that 36.5% of WWP warriors self-reported experiencing TBI due to military service,” said Jen Silva, Chief Program Officer, WWP.\\xa0 “The Blast Overpressure Safety Act will help protect Service members from blast overpressure and TBI; improve research and data collection regarding brain health and safety; and expand access to effective treatments and support for veterans with brain injury.

Following the Lewiston shooting, Senators King and Collins have been working together to increase mental health funding. In March, the entire Maine Delegation announced that the Maine Department of Health and Human Services (Maine DHHS) would receive $2,048,452 through the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s (SAMHSA) Emergency Response Grant program (SERG). The funding is used for community mental health needs in the greater-Lewiston community, following the shooting that claimed the lives of 18 individuals and wounded 13 others. The delegation also sent a follow-up letter to the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of the Army, Lieutenant General Donna W. Martin, to further press for a comprehensive review of the facts and events leading up to the October 25 mass shooting. Senator King has also introduced legislation to save lives and protect 2nd Amendment rights for all Maine people. The Gas-Operated Semiautomatic Firearm Exclusion (GOSAFE) Act addresses the lethal capacity weapons like the one used in Lewiston and most of the deadliest mass shootings across the country. More specifically, the bill protects communities from gun violence while safeguarding law-abiding Americans’ constitutional right to own a firearm for legitimate self-defense, hunting and sporting purposes. ###',\n",

She joined Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, and other members of Congress for this historic event. The Congressional Gold Medal is a reality for these women because of a bipartisan, bicameral bill Senators Collins and Bob Casey (D-PA) authored. During her remarks, Senator Collins shared the story of the Maine women who worked industrial jobs making supplies and defense equipment during WWII. 3,700 of these women worked as welders, mechanics, and crane operators in South Portland to build 274 Liberty ships for the U.S. Navy. An additional 1,600 women worked in Bath to build over 80 ships. “At a time of great peril for freedom here at home and around the world, an estimated 16 million women stepped forward to learn new skills and to produce the battle ships, war planes, and equipment required by our troops to win the war,” Senator Collins said. “Mothers, wives, sisters, and daughters answered our nation’s call to action by working tirelessly in factories, farms, shipyards, aircraft, plants and steel mills in support of our Armed Forces.” During the event, the “Rosies” accepted the Congressional Gold Medal, which is the oldest and highest civilian award in the United States awarded by Congress. Only 185 people, events, or institutions have been awarded the distinction. The percentage of women in the workforce jumped from 27 percent to nearly 37 percent between 1940 and 1945. By the time the war ended, nearly one out of every four married women worked outside the home.\\xa0These “Rosie the Riveters” took positions across various industries, but the aviation industry saw the biggest increase of female workers – with more than 310,000 working in the aircraft industry in 1943, representing 65 percent of its workforce.

In the letter to President Biden, the Senators suggest that the Japanese agricultural ministry has created unnecessary roadblocks for American potato exports resulting in a $150 million loss to potato growers. The U.S. potato industry is worth more than $100 billion. Around 20% of U.S.-grown potatoes are exported, contributing nearly $4.8 billion to the domestic economy, and supporting nearly 34,000 jobs. More specifically, according to the Maine Potato Board, Maine ranks 6th nationally for acres of potatoes planted and harvested in 2022 and 9th nationally for the value of potato sales that same year. The Maine potato industry supports more than 6,500 full and part-time jobs. “We believe the Prime Minister of Japan’s visit to the United States poses an opportunity to address this longstanding issue and make progress in finally allowing U.S. grown fresh potatoes to be exported to Japan,” the Senators wrote.\\xa0“U.S. producers continue to face significant obstacles in gaining access to the market in Japan […] Despite the efforts of USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Japan’s Ministry of Agriculture, Farming and Fisheries (MAFF) continues to delay substantive negotiations on table stock access.” “There is no valid phytosanitary justification for these delays, as the U.S. potato industry has a strong history of exporting fresh potatoes to many markets, including South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Thailand,”\\xa0the letter continues. “We strongly urge you to raise this issue with Prime Minister Kishida during his visit to the United States.” Senators Collins and King also signed a letter to Secretary Vilsack last year requesting assistance to open the Japanese market for U.S. fresh table stock potatoes.

       " '[WASHINGTON, D.C.] – Today, U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and U.S. Representatives Jen Kiggans (R-VA) and Andy Kim (D-NJ) led the introduction of bipartisan, bicameral legislation to expand affordable healthcare options for members of the Selected Reserve and National Guard. The Servicemember Healthcare Freedom Act allows members of the Selected Reserve and National Guard who are also employed by the federal government to choose between military and civilian healthcare plans. “Servicemembers and their families make sacrifices every day in service to our country, and we have an obligation to make sure they have access to affordable, quality healthcare,” said Blumenthal. “With the Servicemember Healthcare Freedom Act, we provide servicemembers the ability to choose which care plans best suit their needs, ensuring they are able to receive essential care while avoiding costly plans and expensive out-of-pocket costs.”\\xa0  “The men and women in the National Guard and Reserves stand ready to defend our nation at a moment’s notice and they deserve to have healthcare that is commensurate with their service,” said Kiggans. “My bipartisan bill will give eligible members of the National Guard and Reserves the access to TRICARE they should already have. As a former Navy helicopter pilot, Navy wife, and now Navy mom, I will always fight to take care of our men and women in uniform!” “Our National Guard and Reserve members bravely volunteer to wear our country’s uniform and deserve straightforward and comprehensive access to military benefits. I am proud to help introduce this legislation to urgently ensure thousands of federally employed servicemembers can access TRICARE coverage and select the healthcare plan that is best for them and their families. This important step would not only lower servicemembers’ healthcare costs and look after military families’ healthcare needs, but improve overall military retention and readiness,” said Kim. The Servicemember Healthcare Freedom Act rectifies a long-standing issue with the Tricare Reserve Select (TRS) program. While TRS is a more affordable health insurance option for many members of the Selected Reserve and National Guard, current federal law prohibits these servicemembers from enrolling in TRS if they are eligible for Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) plans under their civilian employment. As a result, these servicemembers are often forced into more costly healthcare plans. The Servicemember Healthcare Freedom Act would end this prohibition, allowing all servicemembers to choose between the healthcare plans and providing access to more affordable and satisfactory plans. The legislation is co-sponsored in the Senate by U.S. Senators Tina Smith (D-MN), John Fetterman (D-PA), and Kyrsten Sinema (I-AZ). “We have a solemn duty to take care of the men and women who serve in our armed forces. An\\xa0important piece\\xa0of that is ensuring\\xa0they\\xa0can get the health care\\xa0and benefits\\xa0they\\xa0deserve,”\\xa0said Smith.\\xa0“This bill will allow members of the Selected Reserve and National Guard who are employed by the federal government to choose for themselves what health care plan works best for them, reducing out of pocket costs and minimizing gaps in coverage.” “Members of the\\xa0Reserves\\xa0and National Guard should have access to the benefits they\\'ve earned,”\\xa0said Fetterman.\\xa0“Unfortunately, Guardsmen\\xa0and Reservists who are also federal employees are inexplicably prohibited from enrolling in\\xa0TRICARE Reserve Select, an affordable health care option. This is a good, no-nonsense bill that will fix\\xa0a\\xa0clear problem and I’m proud to cosponsor it.” “Arizona servicemembers and their families make difficult sacrifices to keep us safe and secure – it’s our responsibility to ensure they’re supported. Our legislation ensures members of the National Guard and Reserves receive the quality, affordable health care they’ve earned,”\\xa0said Sinema.\\xa0 The Servicemember Healthcare Freedom Act is endorsed by the National Guard Association of the United States (NGUAS), the Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States (EANGUS), and the Reserve Organization of America (ROA). “Guardsmen have an unparalleled commitment to serving our country. Those who are also federal employees should not be penalized and forced into a more expensive healthcare plan,” said retired Major General Francis M. McGinn, the NGAUS president. “Removing this barrier strengthens our federal workforce and eases the financial burden for our military families. It is a straightforward win. We appreciate Sen. Blumenthal for this effort and ask for the full support of Congress.” “This pivotal legislation represents a significant stride forward in recognizing and addressing the unique needs of our service members who serve both in uniform and as civilians within the federal government. This bill is more than a policy change; it\\'s a testament to our Nation\\'s respect for their dual service and a commitment to their health and well-being. EANGUS supports this legislation and thanks Senator Blumenthal and Representatives Kim and Kiggans for their leadership. Together, we can enhance the readiness and vitality of our Armed Forces, ensuring they are as robust and resilient as the Nation they protect,\" said Daniel Reilly, EANGUS President. “It is unacceptable that more than one hundred thousand Reserve and National Guard service members and dual-status technicians must pay over 100 percent more for their healthcare until 2030,” said the ROA’s executive director Jeff Phillips. “ROA thanks Representatives Andy Kim and Jen Kiggans and Senator Richard Blumenthal for sponsoring the\\xa0Servicemember Healthcare Freedom Act, which reduces out-of-pocket expenses and provides continuity of care for reserve component members and dual-status technicians to ensure readiness and improve retention now.” The full text of the bill can be found here. -30-',\n",

The major investment in this community-requested project totals $2.5 million that was signed into law and is now headed to the county. Spanberger worked directly with Prince William County leaders to solicit this request, move this project forward, and ensure it was included in the final package. This investment will help the county construct an interchange and additional improvements at the intersection of Minnieville Road and Prince William Parkway. “The Minnieville Road-Prince William Parkway Interchange Project will relieve some of the congestion that Northern Virginians are all too familiar with and help keep Virginians safe on the road. This $2.5 million federal investment in Prince William County will strengthen the county, invest in our local economy, and support local jobs,” said Spanberger. “With this funding, we are helping to meet the growing demands of this community and putting the pieces together to support this region’s continued growth and economic development — and I have been proud to work directly with county officials and community leaders to secure these federal dollars to help move this project across the finish line.” U.S. Senators Tim Kaine (D-VA) and Mark Warner (D-VA) also worked during the FY2024 appropriations process to make sure this funding for Prince William County was secured in the U.S. Senate-passed package and sent to the President’s desk to be signed into law. “I’m proud to have worked with local leaders in Prince William County and my colleagues in Congress to secure this $2.5 million to invest in roadway improvements, sidewalks, and updated trails,” said Kaine. “Supporting new, improved infrastructure is vital to keeping the people of Virginia safe and connecting our communities to work, school, and essential services.” “I was proud to vote to pass the FY24 government funding legislation and am thrilled to see $2.5 million in dedicated funding go towards making the intersection of Minnieville Road and Prince William Parkway safer and more accessible. I look forward to continuing to champion local projects that ensure folks can get where they need to go quickly and efficiently,” said Warner. Spanberger, Kaine, and Warner secured $2,500,000 for Prince William County to help construct a Single Point Urban Interchange (SPUI) at the intersection of Minnieville Road and Prince William Parkway. The project will help relieve congestion, improve safety, enhance access and connectivity, and support economic development plans in the region. This funding will also provide for the construction of sidewalk and trail segments to improve safety and increase access for pedestrians and bicyclists. BACKGROUND For FY2024, the U.S. House of Representatives allowed for specific Community Project Funding requests — as it did in FY2023.

The Community Project Funding process was created to ensure that Members of Congress — in concert with the communities they represent — may submit direct applications for federal funding to support locally planned projects as part of the yearly appropriations process. To be eligible, projects must be sponsored by local or state government entities or non-profit organizations and must be projects that would otherwise meet the qualifications to apply for federal grant funding. The purpose of Community Project Funding is to ensure direct, local engagement as part of the federal appropriations process. In line with this goal, funding applications needed to demonstrate significant local support for the projects. ### Congresswoman: “We Have Too Much Work to Do to Waste Time on Petty Political Games” WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger today released the following statement after voting against U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene’s (R-GA-14) effort to throw the U.S. House of Representatives into chaos. “Since January 2023, this dysfunctional House Republican majority has […] The Common Ground Scorecard Ranked the Congresswoman as Tied for Fourth Place for Most Bipartisan Elected Official in the Country WASHINGTON, D.C. —\\xa0The nonpartisan Common Ground Committee (CGC) once again ranked U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger as the most bipartisan Member of Congress from Virginia — and gave her the fourth-highest score of any lawmakers in […] Since the Start of 2019, the Congresswoman’s Office Has Returned More Than $38 Million in Backlogged IRS Refunds, Social Security Checks, VA Benefits, & More WASHINGTON, D.C. —\\xa0U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger announced today that her office has now returned more than $38 million in federal casework funds to residents of Virginia’s Seventh District.

       " 'This Federal Award Will Allow Stafford County to Help Alleviate Significant Flooding that Routinely Occurs Along Brooke Road, Improve Access for Residents & Emergency Services WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger today announced that — after her office sent a letter of support — Stafford County has received a $10,251,613 federal grant to raise and realign a portion of Brooke Road to alleviate frequent flooding that occurs along the road. This funding is made possible through the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) and Federal Highway Administration’s Promoting Resilient Operations for Transformative, Efficient, and Cost-Saving Transportation (PROTECT) Grant Program — created by the bipartisan infrastructure law, which Spanberger helped negotiate and voted to pass. This award will allow Stafford County to realign a 0.45-mile portion of Brooke Road from Loblolly Lane to Maplewood Drive to relocate the road out of the floodplain. The project will address frequent flooding on portions of the road that become impassable for extended periods of time during heavy rainstorms, isolating more than 600 residents and restricting access to food, water, shelter, places of work, and emergency services. The roadway runs parallel to Accokeek Creek, a major tributary to the Potomac River. “Virginians deserve safe roads to drive on in their communities. The project to be funded by this more than $10 million federal grant will finally help relieve persistent flooding that keeps residents of Stafford County and those traveling through from getting where they need to go, getting what they need, and getting the emergency services they might depend on,” said Spanberger. “The bipartisan infrastructure law is continuing to deliver for Virginia’s communities — and I was proud to have a hand in crafting the bipartisan framework that led to this historic investment in our nation’s physical infrastructure needs.” “Stafford County is grateful to the Federal Highway Administration and Department of Transportation for the opportunity to be awarded the $10.2 million PROTECT Grant,” said Meg Bohmke, Chairwoman, Stafford County Board of Supervisors. “Once obtained, it will play a crucial role in addressing the persistent flooding issues at the ‘S’ curve on Brooke Road. It will also enable the County to implement a sustainable solution, ensuring the safety and accessibility of the residents living beyond that point.” BACKGROUND According to USDOT, the Promoting Resilient Operations for Transformative, Efficient, and Cost-Saving Transportation (PROTECT) Discretionary Grant Program was created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act — also known as the bipartisan infrastructure law— to provide funding to ensure surface transportation resilience to natural hazards including climate change, sea level rise, flooding, extreme weather events, and other natural disasters through support of planning activities, resilience improvements, community resilience and evacuation routes, and at-risk coastal infrastructure.

       " ' View Video of Senator Rosen’s Questioning HERE WASHINGTON, DC – Today, during a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee, U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV) called on the Administration to continue providing unimpeded security assistance to Israel as it faces imminent threats from Iran and ongoing attacks from Iranian proxies such as Hamas and Hezbollah. She also asked Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin how Congress can best support the Department of Defense’s efforts to help Israel defend itself. In her questioning, Senator Rosen highlighted the need for the U.S. House of Representatives to pass the bipartisan Senate-passed supplemental security package that would assist Israel in its objectives to free the hostages, defeat Hamas, and defend against threats from Iran and its proxies. Below is an excerpt from Senator Rosen’s questioning:\\xa0 Senator Rosen: The October 7th terrorist attack on Israel must never be allowed to take place again. The U.S. security assistance to Israel must therefore continue unimpeded. But Israel’s security has only become more complicated in recent weeks and months, as it not only works to defeat Hamas and free the hostages, but also faces frequent threats and attacks by Iran and its proxies like Hezbollah and of course so many others. So, Secretary Austin, beyond the House finally passing the Senate-passed supplemental security package – which I am fighting for – what more can be done to help Israel defend itself, including from what are reportedly imminent threats from Iran? Secretary Austin: We’re doing a lot, senator, and first of all, thank you for your support for the supplemental. And I, like you, I hope, sincerely hope, that we can get this across the goal line in the near future here. The Chairman and I talk to our counterparts frequently and assess what additional things that we could be doing to help Israel [and] try to understand, you know, what their priorities are and their direction of travel is. And, again, we do in those conversations talk about the necessity to protect civilians, as you would expect, and to provide humanitarian assistance. But we are doing everything we can to make sure that we get them what they need as quickly as possible. And again, I would expect that things would, as the nature of this fight begins to change to become a more precision fight, then their requirements will, should change a bit. And so, we will stay abreast of their needs, and we will continue to provide security assistance as quickly as we can. We remain committed to helping Israel defend itself. But, we expect that they would execute operations responsibly. And again, these are constant conversations that we have.\\xa0 ###',\n",
       " 'Bipartisan Legislation Would Establish First-Ever National Coordinator to Counter Antisemitism, Tasked With Overseeing Interagency Task Force WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senators Jacky Rosen (D-NV) and James Lankford (R-OK), along with Representatives Kathy Manning (D-NC-6), Chris Smith (R-NJ-4), Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA-1), and Randy Weber (R-TX-14) introduced the bipartisan Countering Antisemitism Act to take historic action to counter antisemitism in the United States. While antisemitism has been on the rise in the U.S. for years, it has skyrocketed since the terrorist attack on Israel launched by Hamas on October 7, 2023. In the three months following the October 7 attack, the ADL found there had been a 360 percent increase in antisemitic attacks in the U.S. as compared to the same period the year before. This bipartisan legislation would take comprehensive action to strengthen efforts to combat antisemitism in America, including by establishing a first-ever National Coordinator to Counter Antisemitism, who would oversee federal efforts to counter domestic antisemitism and lead an interagency task force to implement the U.S. National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism and future government strategies. “Antisemitism has been dramatically rising in the United States in the last several years and skyrocketed in the months since the horrific October 7 terror attack on Israel,” said Senator Rosen. “There have been countless disturbing stories of Jewish families accosted and assaulted on streets, Jewish businesses and places of worship vandalized and desecrated, and Jewish students threatened at colleges and universities. My bipartisan legislation would establish a National Coordinator to Counter Antisemitism for the first time ever, and take other much-needed steps across the federal government to fight\\xa0anti-Jewish hatred, bigotry, and violence in the United States.” “In America, we have the right to have a faith and to live that faith. No American should live in fear that they will be attacked simply because of their religious views,” said Senator Lankford. “As the number of acts of antisemitism continues to rise, Jewish communities across the US deserve action to protect this basic freedom. This bill will work to combat antisemitism by establishing roles to provide transparent oversight, address Holocaust denials and distortions, counter discrimination on college campuses, and designate May as Jewish American Heritage Month. Our Jewish friends and neighbors should not live in fear because of their faith and heritage and this bill affirms the right to live their faith freely.” “Over the past decade, antisemitism has been on the rise in the United States. In the aftermath of the October 7th Hamas terrorist attack on Israel, American Jews are facing an explosion of antisemitic hatred and violence. This frightening development requires a comprehensive, all-of-government, approach. Our bipartisan, bicameral Countering Antisemitism Act will do just that,” said Congresswoman Manning. “This critically needed legislation will strengthen federal efforts to combat antisemitism and protect the Jewish community by codifying portions of the President’s first-ever National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism and establishing a National Coordinator in the White House to oversee an Interagency Task Force to Counter Antisemitism. This Act requires law enforcement to ensure robust threat assessment reporting, enhances education about the history of antisemitism and the dangers posed not just to Jews but to Democracy, requires an analysis of online antisemitism with recommendations to Congress, supports the Nonprofit Security Grant Program, and more.” “The threat of antisemitic violent extremism has grown massively since Hamas’ atrocity spree on October 7, and the annual threat assessment from the FBI and other security agencies will focus attention on the dangers of antisemitic violence across the United States, including in my own congressional district,” said Congressman Chris Smith, who authored the law that created the international Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism. “The National Coordinator will oversee an Interagency Task Force to Counter Antisemitism—with a responsibility to report to Congress—and the bill strongly states that the federal government should apply the IHRA definition of antisemitism. Additionally, provisions on the Department of Education should help break through bottlenecks and roadblocks to countering antisemitic discrimination in higher education. I’ll work hard to pass this bill—and then to conduct oversight to ensure that it’s correctly and vigorously implemented by the Executive Branch.” “Antisemitism has no place in our country,” said Congressman Fitzpatrick. “I am alarmed by the rising acts and incidences of antisemitism and hate across our nation. As a Co-Chair of the Bipartisan Taskforce for Combatting Antisemitism, I am proud to join this bipartisan and bicameral effort to make sure that our federal government is doing everything we can to protect our Jewish communities.” “Over the past six months, we’ve witnessed an alarming surge in antisemitism to levels unseen in our nation’s history, and it’s utterly appalling,” said Congressman Weber. “As members of Congress, we cannot stand idly by and watch our Jewish community face relentless attacks on account of their faith. This reprehensible behavior has no place on American soil, and my colleagues and I refuse to tolerate it any longer. It’s time for the federal government to ramp up its efforts to safeguard our Jewish friends, and this bipartisan legislation will serve as a crucial step in achieving that goal.” “As ADL data shows, the U.S. Jewish community is facing the worst crisis of antisemitism that we have seen in a generation,” said Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of ADL. “We applaud the Countering Antisemitism Act and its efforts to implement and make permanent the National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism.\\xa0 The U.S. government must pursue policies and create the necessary infrastructure to fight antisemitism today and well into the future; these efforts must endure beyond any single Administration or 12-month timeline. Thank you, Senators Jacky Rosen and James Lankford and Representatives Kathy Manning and Chris Smith, Co-Chairs of the House and Senate Bipartisan Task Forces for Combating Antisemitism, for leading this critical, timely bipartisan initiative. This historic bill is the most far-reaching antisemitism initiative ever to be introduced in Congress. As we face such historic levels of antisemitism, the Countering Antisemitism Act offers a smart, innovative whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach to combating this hatred and protecting Jews around the country.” “The surge of antisemitism in the U.S. is an urgent threat to Jews and to all Americans, a threat which has only grown more severe since Hamas’ October 7 attacks on Israel,” said Ted Deutch, CEO of American Jewish Committee. “American Jewish Committee’s (AJC) State of Antisemitism in America 2023 Report found that 63% of American Jews feel the status of Jews is less secure than one year ago — more than a 20 percentage point increase in just one year. One in four reported they were the target of an antisemitic incident—a physical attack, remark, vandalism or messaging—in 2023, and 46% reported changing their behavior out of fear of antisemitism in the past 12 months. As the one-year anniversary of the U.S. National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism draws near, we applaud the co-chairs of the House and Senate Bipartisan Task Forces for Combating Antisemitism, Senators Jacky Rosen (D-NV) and James Lankford (R-OK), and Representatives Kathy Manning (D-NC) and Chris Smith (R-NJ), for coming together on a bipartisan basis to introduce comprehensive legislation urgently needed to counter domestic antisemitism and protect Jewish communities across our country. We are grateful to these congressional champions for taking decisive action to fight anti-Jewish hate and preserve our democracy.” “We applaud the bipartisan and bicameral introduction of the Countering Antisemitism Act, which is the largest legislative package ever considered to combat antisemitism,” said William C. Daroff, CEO of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. “This Act, sponsored by co-chairs of the Senate and House Bipartisan Task Forces for Combating Antisemitism, contains critical provisions that will strengthen federal efforts and capacity to fight antisemitism, including by establishing the position of a National Coordinator to Counter Antisemitism to chair an interagency task force. Given the unprecedented surge of antisemitism in the U.S. following the October 7th terrorist attacks on Israel, this legislation is a significant step in protecting American Jewry and combating the oldest of hatreds.” “This bill contains important provisions that will support our Jewish Federation communities across the country as we work together daily and tirelessly to combat the tsunami of antisemitism we face. We are proud to support its passage,” said Julie Platt, Chair of the Board of Trustees of the Jewish Federations of North America. The bipartisan and bicameral Countering Antisemitism Act would: Senators Rosen and Lankford and Representatives Manning, Smith, Fitzpatrick, and Weber serve as co-chairs of the Senate and House Bipartisan Task Forces for Combating Antisemitism, respectively. The Task Forces were instrumental in pushing for the first-ever U.S. National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism. ###',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV), a member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC), voted to advance two bipartisan bills to improve U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) resources to better detect illicit drugs like fentanyl and other contraband smuggled across the U.S. southern border. The bipartisan Border Enforcement, Security, and Trade (BEST) Facilitation Act would create new CBP positions to closely inspect x-ray scan images to detect illicit contraband in any cargo coming into the United States. The bipartisan Contraband Awareness Technology Catches Harmful (CATCH) Fentanyl Act would establish a pilot program to assess the effectiveness of technologies that can speed up and enhance cargo inspection at U.S. ports of entry. Both bills advanced out of HSGAC today and are now one step closer to being considered on the Senate floor. “Most illicit fentanyl comes to our communities after being smuggled into the U.S. through the southern border,” said Senator Rosen. “When we stop illegal drugs like fentanyl from coming in through the border, we are saving lives in Nevada. That’s why I helped pass two commonsense, bipartisan bills through committee to improve CBP resources and technology to better detect illicit items like fentanyl from being smuggled into our communities.” Senator Rosen has consistently worked across the aisle to secure the border and stop the flow of fentanyl. Last month, Rosen’s bipartisan END FENTANYL Act was signed into law, which will help crack down on drug smuggling by requiring the CBP Commissioner to update its drug interdiction guidance to ensure it is up to date. She also voted to pass the bipartisan border security deal which would invest more than $20 billion to secure the border, get law enforcement the resources they need, and combat the fentanyl crisis. Senator Rosen has also called on the Biden administration to prioritize additional resources to stop the flow of illicit drugs like fentanyl through ports of entry along the border, pushed for increased resources to support border personnel, and voted to advance legislation to provide nearly $14 billion in funding to strengthen border security and humanely process migrants. ###',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON, DC – Today, U.S. Senators Jacky Rosen (D-NV) and Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), and Congressman Mark Amodei (R-NV-02) met with United States Postal Service (USPS) officials regarding the proposed downsizing and relocation of the mail processing operations from Reno, Nevada to Sacramento, California. The bipartisan Nevada delegation expressed their deep concerns about the effects the plan would have on mail service reliability and local jobs, and pushed USPS officials to instead listen to local Nevada leaders, businesses, and residents. “In our meeting with USPS executives today, they were unable to provide us with detailed explanations of how this misguided proposal is good for Nevada,” said Senator Rosen. “I’m outraged by the lack of answers and transparency we have received on a matter that could lead to delayed mail delivery for Nevadans who depend on it. I won’t stop pushing to stop this ill-advised plan, and I look forward to questioning Postmaster General Louis DeJoy about it next week.” “In today’s meeting with the USPS I made it clear that moving the Reno distribution center to California is a mistake that would kill Nevada jobs and could delay the delivery of Nevadans’ essential medications, benefits, and ballots,” said Senator Cortez Masto. “Not a single Nevadan I’ve talked to thinks this is a good idea, and I will continue fighting to stop it.” “Despite today’s meeting with the Postal Service, anything resembling Reno-specific justifications for the proposed plan to ship Nevada’s mail to Sacramento and back is still unavailable,” said Congressman Amodei. “I want to thank House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) for meeting with me today to discuss how we can best oversee the Postal Service, as well as Senators Cortez Masto and Rosen for their part in helping to finally organize a sit-down meeting with officials from the Postal Service, despite months of requests. There is still much to be done in getting the justification for sending Nevada-addressed mail to another state before being sent back to Nevada for delivery.” Senators Rosen and Cortez Masto, and Congressman Amodei have consistently opposed the proposed relocation because of the impact it would have on mail service reliability and local jobs. They recently sent a bipartisan letter expressing serious concern about the proposed relocation of mail processing in Reno. Senators Rosen and Cortez Masto also joined a group of over 20 Senators in a letter urging Postmaster General Louis DeJoy to stop any changes or relocations to USPS processing facilities that would result in job losses and further degrade mail delivery performance, especially in rural states.\\xa0 ###',\n",
       " ' View Video of Senator Rosen’s Questioning HERE WASHINGTON, DC – During a hearing of the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV) urged the passage of her bipartisan legislation that would help lower child care costs for hardworking families. Her Small Business Child Care Investment Act with Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) would increase the availability of affordable, high-quality child care by allowing non-profit providers to participate in the same loan programs from the Small Business Administration that for-profit child care providers have access to. The legislation passed out of committee last year, and it’s awaiting a vote in the U.S. Senate. Below is an excerpt from Senator Rosen’s questioning:\\xa0 Senator Rosen: Senator Ernst, one of our favorite bills we have together, the Small Business Childcare Investment Act. I know she has referred to it. But this is really, as you just said, the crux, a foundational issue for all of us. So I mentioned when Administrator Guzman came before the committee last month, the lack of access to affordable childcare. Like I said, you just alluded to – it’s a crisis that demands immediate action. Infant child care in Nevada – it costs families over $13,000 a year on average. And the rising cost of child care – it’s financially squeezing parents across the state and across the country. And like I said, I am going to keep mentioning our Small Business Childcare Investment Act until we get that passed because it is, I think it will be a game changer. And it’s going to increase the availability of affordable, high-quality childcare for working families by for the first time allowing nonprofit providers to have the same access to SBA loan programs as for-profit providers. That’s a game changer. It’s been over 260 days since that legislation passed out of this committee. There is no excuse for finally getting this long-past due bill across the finish line.\\xa0 ###',\n",

Pete Aguilar and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra visited SAC Health – San Bernardino to highlight the investments made by Congress and the Biden-Harris Administration to make health care more affordable and equitable in the Inland Empire. Rep. Aguilar hosted a fireside chat with Secretary Becerra and CEO of SAC Health, Jason Lohr, to discuss the importance of federal funding in supporting better health outcomes for Latino residents in the region, followed by a press event celebrating the success of the Inflation Reduction Act in bringing down prescription drug costs. “It was a pleasure having Secretary Becerra in the Inland Empire to highlight the shared commitment of the Biden Administration and House Democrats to make health care more affordable for folks in our region,” said Rep. Pete Aguilar. “While we celebrate these victories, we must also acknowledge the challenges that lie ahead. Far too many hardworking residents pay too much for prescription drugs and access to basic medical care. I am committed to continue pushing to lower costs and improve health care access in the Inland Empire.” “Here in San Bernadino, and across the country, accessible, high-quality health care is being recognized as a right for all, and not just a privilege for the wealthy. Finally, more families than ever in California have the peace of mind that comes from knowing they have coverage,” said Xavier Becerra, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. “We are grateful for Congressman Aguilar’s ongoing commitment to support SAC Health and our ability to provide care to the community,” said Jason Lohr, CEO of SAC Health. “For over a decade, he has been a champion in helping secure over 85 million dollars of HHS grant funds that have supported SAC Health programs such as our medical mobile clinic, residency training through our Teaching Health Center funding, HIV care, and Medication Assisted Treatment clinic grants. As we actively expand our locations, access, and services, we look forward to his continued support that will allow us to provide quality healthcare to those who need it the most.” In 2022, Rep. Aguilar helped pass the Inflation Reduction Act, which capped the cost of insulin at $35/month for Medicare enrollees and lowered insurance premiums for those enrolled through the Affordable Care Act. Last year, Rep. Aguilar also helped deliver over $3 million in federal funding from HHS to SAC Health to support their operations and increase access to affordable care in the region. Additionally, in 2022, Rep. Aguilar secured $375,000 to help expand SAC Health’s Mobile Health Clinic program, which officially opened last year. \\r\\n                    Please signup here to receive email newsletter updates from Representative Aguilar\\nYou may cancel or unsubscribe at any time\\n  First Name\\n\\n Last Name\\n\\n Email\\n\\n \\n \\nWashington, DC Office\\r\\n                108 Cannon House Office Building\\r\\n                Washington, DC 20515\\r\\n                Phone: (202) 225-3201\\r\\n                 \\nDistrict Office\\r\\n                685 E.

       " 'WASHINGTON, DC—Congressman Paul D. Tonko (NY-20) today introduced his Cultural Resources Challenge Act, new legislation that would support and protect the nation’s cultural resources by empowering the National Park Service (NPS) to expand historic preservation efforts. Tonko’s legislation comes days after the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) released their Cultural Resources Challenge for the National Parks Service report, which called upon Congress to better support and fund NPS to restore and protect the nation’s resources. “Our national parks are powerful, awe-inspiring records of our rich heritage and history,” Congressman Tonko said. “Despite their vital historic and economic benefits, our cultural resources are continuously underfunded and facing dire threats through natural disasters and climate change. My Cultural Resources Challenge Act seeks to address these threats. By addressing staff shortages with the National Park Service, confronting the role of climate change, and improving resiliency and accessibility of cultural resources, my bill will help ensure our cultural resources can continue to connect individuals and communities with the stories of our shared past and inspire future generations.” “History is at the heart of our national parks, which protect pivotal stories of the Revolutionary War, the Civil Rights Movement, and countless other chapters of the ever-unfolding American narrative. National Park Service rangers work tirelessly to teach park visitors about our country’s diverse, complex cultural resources.” said Alan Spears, Senior Director of Cultural Resources for the National Parks Conservation Association. “But chronic underfunding means fewer talented National Park Service historians and other expert staff are left to tell those stories at parks every year. Funding shortfalls have left our history vulnerable to climate change-related disaster, with flood and fire threatening historic buildings, battlefields, and more. The National Parks Conservation Association proudly supports Congressman Tonko’s Cultural Resources Challenge Act, which would breathe new life into cultural resources management and preservation in our national parks. New funding would help the Park Service recruit more of the best and brightest cultural resources staff, as well as safeguard American history from climate change. This bill would help equip the Park Service to continue to serve as some of America’s greatest storytellers, and protect our American legacy for generations to come.” “This legislation recognizes the vital importance of safeguarding our shared cultural heritage in U.S. National Parks from the growing threat of accelerating climate change impacts, including coastal flooding, extreme heat and worsening wildfires.

       " \"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Congressman Brad Finstad (MN-01) introduced the EPA Accountability to Farm Country Act, legislation that would require the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and farmer stakeholders to review rules and regulations proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that may impact the agricultural sector and provide recommendations on how to limit the impact. If EPA does not mitigate the effect of their proposed rule, it would be unable to be finalized. “American farmers are the best environmentalists in the world, and the EPA’s repeated failure to consider the impact of their regulatory agenda on agriculture has made clear that they are out-of-touch with farm country,” said Rep. Finstad. “Those who are directly impacted by EPA regulations – American farm families who work tirelessly to feed and fuel the world – deserve a seat at the table.” The EPA Accountability to Farm Country Act is endorsed by the American Farm Bureau Federation, National Corn Growers Association, National Pork Producers Council, Meat Institute, Agricultural Retailers Association, U.S. Beet Sugar Association, American Sugarbeet Growers Association, North American Blueberry Council, Minnesota Corn Growers Association, Minnesota Soybean Growers Association, and Minnesota Farm Bureau. “All too often, growers are left out of federal rulemaking efforts, even though those rules have major implications for farm families, agriculture, and rural communities. It is critical that farmers have a say in crafting rules and regulations that affect them, and Minnesota Corn Growers Association appreciates Congressman Finstad’s work to ensure that farmers are given that opportunity. Bills like the EPA Accountability to Farm Country Act sponsored by Congressman Finstad assure that farmers have a seat at the table so regulatory agencies fully understand the impact of their rules. Congressman Finstad has a long history of supporting farmers, and we are proud to endorse the EPA Accountability to Farm Country Act.” – Dana Allen-Tully, President, Minnesota Corn Growers Association “Farmers rely on a variety of products to maintain sustainable farming enterprises, and many of those products are approved and reviewed by the EPA. Agriculture needs a voice during these important conversations, and the Minnesota Farm Bureau applauds Congressman Finstad's leadership on this issue.” \\xa0–\\xa0Dan Glessing, President of Minnesota Farm Bureau\\xa0 Specifically, the EPA Accountability to Farm Country Act: Original cosponsors of the EPA Accountability to Farm Country Act include Representatives Dusty Johnson (R-SD-AL), Don Bacon (R-NE-02), Ashley Hinson (R-IA-02), Scott Franklin (R-FL-18), Derrick Van Orden (R-WI-03), Dan Newhouse (R-WA-04), Michelle Fischbach (R-MN-07), Austin Scott (R-GA-08), Roger Williams (R-TX-25), Mike Flood (R-NE-01), and Barry Moore (R-AL-02).

       " \"For Immediate Release WASHINGTON, DC – Today, Congressman Jamaal Bowman, Ed.D. (NY-16), along with 16 of his colleagues, introduced the\\xa0 ACCESS In Mental Health Act.\\xa0 To address the systemic issues in our nation’s mental health system, Congressman Bowman (NY-16) introduced the Advancing Culturally Competent and Equitable Supportive Services (ACCESS) in Mental Health Act. This bill would: Provide grants to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) including Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) to create, expand, or improve graduate programs in mental health fields. These fields include psychology, counseling, social work, psychiatry, school-based mental health professions, substance use disorder prevention and treatment, and more.\\xa0 Provide grants of $10,000 per year to students pursuing graduate degrees in mental health fields at HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs to help cover the cost of attendance. “As an educator for 20 years, I saw firsthand how the lack of mental health professionals and culturally responsive care impacted my students and their families,” said Congressman Jamaal Bowman, Ed.D. (NY-16). “Not only do we need more mental health professionals in our communities and schools, but we need more Black and Brown mental health professionals who are equipped to provide culturally responsive and trauma-informed care. My ACCESS in Mental Health Act would work to rectify the lack of diversity in the mental health workforce by providing grants to HBCUs, TCUs, HSIs, MSIs, and their students, to create and expand programs and to support tuition costs. We’ve been facing a national mental health crisis over the last few years and Congress must begin to take action by strengthening our mental health workforce and investing in opportunities for young people from all communities to enter mental health fields.”\\xa0\\xa0 “As our country faces a mental health crisis, we must do everything in our power to address this issue head on,”\\xa0said Congressman Tony Cárdenas. “The ACCESS in Mental Health Act does just that by investing in the buildup and diversification of our mental health workforce in order to provide more Americans with the access to culturally responsive health professionals and care.”  To read the bill summary click here.

Velázquez (NY-07), and Bonnie Watson Coleman (NJ-12) The ACCESS in Mental Health Act is endorsed by: American Psychological Association, American Federation of Teachers, Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, National Association of Social Workers, American Mental Health Counselors Association, National Association of School Psychologists, American Association of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, National Alliance on Mental Illness, Anxiety and Depression Association of America, American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, American Counseling Association, American Association for Psychoanalysis in Clinical Social Work, International OCD Foundation, Maternal Mental Health Leadership Alliance, and Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, and Young Invincibles. “The American Psychological Association strongly supports the ACCESS in Mental Health Act and applauds Representative Bowman for his leadership,” said Arthur C. Evans, Jr., PhD, CEO of the American Psychological Association. “The need for a diverse, representative, culturally and linguistically competent mental health workforce is necessary now, more than ever. The ACCESS in Mental Health Act will help make this a reality by building, strengthening, and supporting pathways to degrees in mental health fields within institutions of higher education that have historically educated predominantly students of color.”\\xa0 “Too many of our students are struggling with their mental wellness, making it harder for them to do well in school, pursue their passions, and develop the skills they need in adulthood,” said Randi Weingarten, President of the American Federation of Teachers. “Whether it's cyberbullying and too much exposure to harmful accounts on social media, the isolation and loneliness from the pandemic, or the trauma from witnessing gun violence, the need for more robust mental health services in schools has gone dramatically unmet, particularly in under-resourced schools and communities. Schools should be able to provide more than just academic support, especially because often, schools are one of the only consistent places of safety for kids. Congressman Bowman's bill tackles this need head-on by increasing the number of mental health professionals available to work with students. It establishes and expands graduate programs so more folks can enter this profession, and it makes them more affordable too. Every day, AFT educators and healthcare professionals see the impact these challenges have on our next generation, so we know first-hand: it’s more important than ever to pass the ACCESS in Mental Health Act as soon as possible.” Permalink: https://bowman.house.gov/2024/4/rep-jamaal-bowman-introduces-the-access-in-mental-health-act-to-strengthen-mental-health-workforce \\r\\n        345 Cannon House Office Building\\r\\n        Washington, DC 20003\\r\\n        Phone: (202) 225-2464\\r\\n        Fax: (202) 225-5513\\r\\n       \\nOpens in February 2023!\\r\\n        222 Mamaroneck Ave.\\r\\n        Suite 312\\r\\n        White Plains, NY 10605\\r\\n        Phone: (914) 323-5550\\r\\n       \\r\\n        6 Gramatan Ave.\\r\\n        Suite 205\\r\\n        Mt.

       " 'Washington, D.C. – In case you missed it, on Tuesday, Defense One reported that Congresswoman Elise Stefanik introduced a new bill Wednesday to accelerate the Defense Department’s use of quantum information science, from sensing and navigation to more ambitious goals of quantum computing for advanced artificial intelligence applications.\\xa0 Read the full article below:\\xa0 Defense One: New bill would greatly expand Defense Department quantum efforts By Patrick Tucker\\xa0 Republican lawmakers will introduce a new bill Wednesday to accelerate the Defense Department’s use of quantum information science, from sensing and navigation to more ambitious goals of quantum computing for advanced artificial intelligence applications.\\xa0 Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., and Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., will introduce the Defense Quantum Acceleration Act. The legislation would direct the Defense Department to establish a new quantum advisor role and stand up a center of excellence to “explore and identify\\xa0 [quantum information science] technologies that have demonstrated value in advancing the priorities and missions of the Department,” according to the text of the bill, viewed exclusively by Defense One.\\xa0 Quantum information science, which takes advantage of the unique properties of quantum mechanics, has many potential defense applications. Information that’s encrypted on the quantum level can’t be secretly intercepted because attempting to measure a quantum property changes it. Quantum sensors can relay information about location, making them a more secure means of navigation than GPS, which can be spoofed. Quantum computers, today in their infancy, could eventually process information exponentially more effectively than conventional computers. The National Academies of Sciences has said “quantum computers are the only known model for computing that could offer exponential speedup over today’s computers.” But China has outpaced the Defense Department in terms of investment in quantum technology, dedicating $15 billion over the next five years—or $3 billion a year—as opposed to the $700 million yearly Defense Department investment.\\xa0 The new bill doesn’t push the Defense Department to match China’s numbers, as private companies like IBM, Google, and Lockheed Martin are also heavily spending research and development dollars on next-generation quantum computing. But it does raise the profile of quantum technology within the Defense Department and, theoretically, would allow the Pentagon to start buying more quantum technologies faster, enabling quicker innovation from private companies.\\xa0 “Quantum’s impact on our national security will be considerable, and we must take immediate steps to ensure the United States is the first nation to reach quantum advantage. This bill will ensure the Department of Defense, led by the incredible work at [The U.S. Air Force Rome Laboratory in New York] is able to outpace our adversaries and rapidly develop and transition quantum technologies to our service members,” Stefanik said in a statement.\\xa0 The Defense Department already has a director of quantum science in the office of the undersecretary for research and engineering. Under the bill, the newly-established quantum advisor would have a much-expanded role, coordinating with combatant commands on where they might need or use quantum science, coordinating with allies like Australia to share knowledge and best practices, and specifically looking at the challenges the Defense Department faces to determine if quantum information science might help.\\xa0 The bill would also direct the stand-up of a center to coordinate with businesses and academia and develop prototypes of more near-term quantum technologies for sensing and navigation, in addition to accelerating quantum computing research. Chris Padilla, vice president of government and regulatory affairs at IBM, applauded the introduction of the act, which he said, “helps ensure the Department of Defense embraces this revolutionary technology. For national defense and economic security reasons, the United States must maintain a leadership position in quantum computing, and this legislation supports that effort. IBM encourages Congress to pass it and the administration to begin deploying quantum-centric supercomputing.” Permalink: https://stefanik.house.gov/2024/4/icymi-defense-one-new-bill-would-greatly-expand-defense-department-quantum-efforts 2211 Rayburn House Office Building Washington, DC 20515 Phone: (202) 225-4611 137 Margaret Street, Suite 100 Plattsburgh, NY 12901 Phone: (518) 561-2324 Fax: (518) 561-2408 330 Ford Street, Suite B8 Ogdensburg, NY 13669 Phone: (315) 541-2670 99 Troy Road, Suite 312 East Greenbush, NY 12061 Phone: (518) 242-4707 Phone: (315) 219-8005',\n",
       " 'Washington, D.C. - Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik and Senator Marsha Blackburn introduced the Defense Quantum Acceleration Act, legislation that would supercharge the Department of Defense’s (DoD) approach to quantum technology and advance U.S. national security, building on the excellent work done by Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) - Rome, in Rome, New York. Currently, there are a number of tremendous individual efforts in quantum across the DoD, such as the quantum computing work being done by AFRL-Rome, but these efforts lack a unified effort and focus on transitioning quantum-enhanced capabilities to the warfighter on a relevant timeline.\\xa0 This bill would establish a framework for the DoD to optimize its approach to the development and transitioning of quantum technology by empowering a Principal Quantum Advisor to the Secretary of Defense to develop a strategic quantum roadmap and provide an independent budget assessment of current DoD quantum budgets to Congress. The bill would also authorize a defense quantum technology testbed to enable the Defense Innovation Unit to successfully execute the transition of near-term quantum capabilities using the $55 million of funding it received for this purpose in Fiscal Year 2024. “I am proud to lead this critical legislation to ensure the United States maintains a quantum technological advantage over our adversaries, including Communist China,” said Representative Stefanik. “Quantum’s impact on our national security will be considerable and we must take immediate steps to ensure the United States is the first nation to reach quantum advantage. This bill will ensure the Department of Defense, led by the incredible work at Rome Labs, is able to outpace our adversaries and rapidly develop and transition quantum technologies to our service members.” “U.S. advancement of quantum technology is critical for our nation to compete on the global stage, as Communist China has made clear their goal to lead the world in this industry by 2049,” said Senator Blackburn. “This legislation helps ensure the Department of Defense maximizes its developmental resources and capitalizes on the incredible work happening at the local level, including in Chattanooga and Oak Ridge.” \"Congresswoman Stefanik\\'s legislation is critical to our national and economic security, and I applaud her foresight in making applied quantum information sciences a priority for the Department of Defense. Much of the military\\'s pathbreaking work in QIS is led by Rome Labs, whose open innovation? initiatives are performed in our world-leading laboratories at Innovare Advancement Center in Rome, NY, where we embed the national quantum workforce strategy into all of our research programs to develop the next generation of quantum scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs. Today, QIS technology is in the laboratory but tomorrow it will likely be in the battlespace. To prepare for this, the U.S. military must have a robust applied QIS R&D infrastructure and talent pipeline to ensure that we are transitioning advances rapidly from the laboratory to the warfighter.\\xa0That\\'s precisely what this bill is all about, and I thank Congresswoman Stefanik for introducing it,” said Heather Hage, President and CEO of the Griffiss Institute. “The Defense Quantum Acceleration Act signifies a critical commitment to leveraging quantum technology to its fullest potential, ensuring that the United States remains at the forefront of technological advancement and strategic defense capabilities. Congresswoman Stefanik is providing key leadership in bolstering America’s national defense industry and securing our nation as the global leader in quantum technology,” said Marc P. Christensen, P.E., Ph.D., President of Clarkson University. “Clarkson University is among our nation’s technological institutions advancing quantum capabilities with the Department of Defense through partnerships like the one we have with Rome Labs, as well as defense contractors on all facets of applied research and educating graduates ready to lead industry in advancing these technologies.” “IBM applauds Representative Stefanik and Senator Blackburn for introducing their Defense Quantum Acceleration Act, which helps ensure the Department of Defense embraces this revolutionary technology. For national defense and economic security reasons, the United States must maintain a leadership position in quantum computing, and this legislation supports that effort. IBM encourages Congress to pass it and the Administration to begin deploying quantum-centric supercomputing,” said Chris Padilla, Vice President of Government and Regulatory Affairs at IBM. “Quantum technologies, including computing, sensors, and networking, have the potential to revolutionize national security.\\xa0The nation that leads in these areas will have a significant military advantage. The Quantum Industry Coalition applauds Rep. Stefanik and Sen. Blackburn for recognizing this, and for introducing the Defense Quantum Acceleration Act to help ensure that the United States will be the world quantum leader for years to come,” said Paul Stimers, Executive Director of the Quantum Industry Coalition. “The Defense Quantum Acceleration Act is landmark legislation.\\xa0For the first time it makes sure the most important advances in quantum information science, from quantum computing and quantum sensing to the latest developments in quantum communication and hybrid technologies, become part of our national defense arsenal.\\xa0At a time when our race for quantum supremacy against China is crucial to the security of America, the DQAA will empower the Department of Defense to find the applications of quantum technology that best serve its needs and requirements, today and far into the future,” said Arthur Herman Senior Fellow, Hudson Institute & Director, Quantum Alliance Initiative. “The field of quantum information science and its applications is a critical area of strategic competition for the United States, and one which the nation cannot afford to lose. Securing a quantum advantage for the warfighter will require a deliberate approach to cultivating these technologies,” said Heather Penney, Senior Fellow at the Air and Space Forces Association\\'s Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies. “PsiQuantum’s mission is to build the world’s first useful quantum computer, and we are grateful for Rep. Stefanik and Sen. Blackburn’s continued leadership on quantum technologies,” said Jeremy O’Brien, CEO and Co-Founder of PsiQuantum. “Utility-scale, fault tolerant quantum computing will be a reality much sooner than conventionally predicted, and both Rep. Stefanik and Sen. Blackburn have understood this reality for years. The Defense Quantum Acceleration Act will ensure that the Department of Defense is prepared to capitalize on the unique ways in which fault tolerant quantum computing can help advance national security imperatives, in both the near- and long-term.” “Quantum information science – and quantum computing in particular – is absolutely crucial to our national and economic security. This bill showcases the U.S.’s strategic vision and leadership that is needed to drive quantum adoption for our nation’s defense and intelligence community,” said Peter Chapman, CEO and President of IonQ. “We believe the Defense Quantum Acceleration Act of 2024 and continued investments by the US Department of Defense in quantum will further accelerate the deployment of transformative computing solutions. We continue to take pride in IonQ’s role as a partner to the U.S. Department of Defense and are excited to support Congresswoman Stefanik and Senator Marsha Blackburn\\'s strategic vision.”\\xa0 \"We applaud Rep. Stefanik for introducing the Defense Quantum Acceleration Act, a policy that will provide a framework for the Department of Defense and its service branches to identify problems that could be addressed by quantum technologies,” said Dr. Alan Baratz, CEO of D-Wave. “Developing and accelerating adoption of quantum and quantum-hybrid applications is critical to achieving mission objectives such as challenges facing the modern battlefield and supply chain logistics. Quantum technologies are advancing at different rates and utilizing the most advanced systems will help achieve an edge in national security.”\\xa0 \"Atom Computing commends Congresswoman Stefanik and Senator Blackburn for spearheading the \"Defense Quantum Acceleration Act\", empowering the Department of Defense to more effectively organize disparate initiatives and operationalize critical quantum technologies that could enable asymmetric competitive advantage for the warfighter. This legislation will give the Department a strategic role in accelerating utility-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing for our national security,\" said Rob Hays, CEO of Atom Computing. “As the world’s largest integrated quantum computing company, Quantinuum strongly supports the Defense Quantum Acceleration Act introduced by Representative Stefanik and Senator Blackburn. Quantum computing is rapidly advancing from the lab to the commercial marketplace and US leadership for this emerging technology will be crucial for economic and national security alike. We believe that the Defense Quantum Acceleration Act will supercharge the Department of Defense’s approach to quantum and drive crucial near-term use cases and workforce development across government and industry,” said Ryan McKenney, Director of Government Relations at Quantinuum.

       " 'Washington, D.C. - In case you missed it, National Review reported that Congresswoman Elise Stefanik sent a letter to the Harvard Corporation demanding Harvard University hold perpetrators of antisemitism accountable. Read the full article below:\\xa0 National Review: Stefanik Blasts Harvard for Failure to Discipline Students Who Allegedly Assaulted Israeli Classmate By Zach Kessel Representative Elise Stefanik (R., N.Y.) sent a letter to Harvard University leadership on Thursday asking why the administration has yet to discipline anti-Israel campus protesters who allegedly accosted and assaulted an Israeli student. During an October 18 “die-in” demonstration intended to signal opposition to Israel’s retaliatory strikes against Hamas after the October 7 terrorist attack, multiple keffiyeh-clad protesters surrounded an Israeli first-year business student, grabbing, pushing, and yelling at him. Harvard has since engaged a law firm to conduct an independent investigation of the incident, and as Stefanik wrote in her letter, local prosecutors are currently in the process of scheduling court hearings for two of the assailants. On March 25, though, the victim’s legal representation “learned that the ‘Clerk’s Hearing’ in the criminal case has been postponed to May 7.” “One of the assailants in the incident, a Harvard Divinity School graduate student, is scheduled to graduate in May 2024. Due to this postponement, the assailant will gain the lifelong distinction of being an alumnus of Harvard despite having committed a well-documented antisemitic hate crime against a fellow student,” Stefanik wrote. The firm representing the victim, Holtzman Vogel, wrote a letter in March to the attorney Harvard retained to conduct its internal investigation asking why the probe had not progressed since it began. Noting that the university and its legal team had not notified them of any developments in the investigation and had not issued proper disciplinary action, the team of attorneys wrote that “the protracted delay all but ensures that at least one of the offending individuals will have the privilege of graduating from Harvard without facing any serious academic or professional consequences for his actions.” The lack of punishment, the attorneys wrote, sends a message that “Harvard students can harass and assault a Jewish individual on camera with impunity, advertise the attack on social media, and still receive a Harvard degree, scot-free.” Stefanik, reminding interim Harvard president Alan Garber and Harvard Corporation senior fellow Penny Pritzker of former president Claudine Gay’s performance at a December congressional hearing, wrote that this latest instance of the university’s refusal to discipline students, faculty, and staff for antisemitic behavior demonstrates a striking lack of accountability on the part of Harvard. “In front of Congress, when disgraced former Harvard President Claudine Gay failed to denounce antisemitism and calls for genocide, she also claimed ‘disciplinary processes are underway’ against perpetrators of antisemitism,” Stefanik wrote. “This has proven to be false, with Harvard producing no evidence of punishment against those who have committed crimes and violated Harvard’s code of conduct.” The New York congresswoman, referencing the sharp decrease in early applicants to Harvard since its post-October 7 wave of antisemitism began, wrote that “at a time when support and applications for Harvard have fallen, university leadership has continuously chosen to side with those who hate Jewish students and faculty and failed to keep them safe.” This particular instance is not the first time Harvard has seemingly stonewalled an investigation. House Education and Workforce Committee chairwoman Virginia Foxx (R., N.C.) announced in March that the university has not complied with a congressional subpoena ordering the administration to provide documents related to the committee’s investigation into Harvard’s handling of antisemitism on its campus. “Harvard’s continued failure to satisfy the Committee’s requests is unacceptable,” Foxx wrote at the time. “I will not tolerate delay and defiance of our investigation while Harvard’s Jewish students continue to endure the firestorm of antisemitism that has engulfed its campus.” Harvard assistant vice president for communications Jonathan Swain told National Review in a statement that the university is intent on fighting antisemitism on its campus. “Antisemitism has no place in the Harvard community,” Swain wrote. “We remain steadfast in our commitment to combating antisemitism, in whatever form it manifests itself and our ongoing efforts to ensure that Jewish students feel safe, valued, and embraced at Harvard.” Swain also wrote in his email to NR that the divinity student referenced in Stefanik’s letter “is not scheduled to graduate in May 2024.” Though Swain would not elaborate on that assertion, NR reviewed previous reporting identifying the student as Elon Tettey Tamaklo — based on an FBI report — and Tamaklo’s LinkedIn page, which indicates that he will in fact receive his degree in May 2024.

On March 25, Holtzman Vogel learned that the “Clerk’s Hearing” in the criminal case has been postponed to May 7. One of the assailants in the incident, an antisemitic Harvard Divinity School graduate student, is scheduled to graduate in May 2024. Due to this postponement, the assailant will gain the lifelong distinction of being an alumnus of Harvard despite having committed a well-documented antisemitic hate crime against a fellow student.\\xa0 In the letter, Congresswoman Stefanik states, “Justice for this incident should have been served quickly, and the delay of justice that specifically allows an antisemitic student to graduate is an affront to accountability and demonstrates the cultural rot of Harvard University’s leadership that has allowed antisemitism to continue.” Read the full letter here.

I am proud to co-lead Chairman Luttrell’s legislation to ensure our veterans’ claims are processed and results are delivered with the urgency they deserve,” said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik. “Over the course of several hearings, I’ve heard time and again about the Veterans Affairs Board of Appeals failing to ensure quality decision making on veterans’ claims,” said Congressman Morgan Luttrell. “The legislation I introduced this week would ensure that the Veteran Affairs Board of Appeals provides veterans and their families with legally accurate and fair decisions on their claims for VA benefits. I will continue to hold the VA’s feet to the fire and do everything in my power to course correct this ship.” “Veterans and their families have earned legally accurate and fair decisions on their claims for VA benefits.

In the FY24 Consolidated Appropriations Act, Congresswoman Stefanik secured a $10M increase for the MDA to conduct planning and design for a third missile defense site at Fort Drum. In the FY24 NDAA, Congresswoman Stefanik led an effort to include report language that states this additional money should be used for “military construction planning and design activities needed to construct a missile defense interceptor site at Fort Drum, New York.” In 2019, the Department of Defense designated Fort Drum as the preferred location for an East Coast missile defense site. The United States’ missile defense architecture is currently aging and a third site would provide additional missile defense coverage to protect our homeland.\\xa0 Watch her line of questioning here. Read a full transcript of her line of questioning below: Congresswoman Stefanik: “First I would like to correct the record. Earlier in this hearing, the ranking member said that the Department of Defense chose Fort Drum as the preferred missile defense site for the third homeland missile defense site nearly ten years ago. That is incorrect despite the fact that you said that’s correct. General Collins, you are aware that the date that that was designated was 2019, correct? Lieutenant General Heath Collins: “Yes, ma’am.” Congresswoman Stefanik: “So the ten years ago was incorrect.” Lieutenant General Collins: “Yes, ma’am. Four years ago.” Congresswoman Stefanik: “Great. You are also aware that just last year, General Milley and Vice Admiral Hill testified in front of this Committee that the construction of a third site at Fort Drum would be strategically worthwhile, correct? You’re aware of that testimony?” Lieutenant General Collins: “Yes, ma’am.” Congresswoman Stefanik: “And you’re also aware that in multiple NDAAs, the language designating Fort Drum as the preferred third site for East Coast missile defense site has been included in multiple NDAAs, you’re aware of that?”\\xa0 Lieutenant General Collins: “Yes, ma’am.” Congresswoman Stefanik: “And just let the record reflect the Ranking Member voted in support of that language, not once but multiple times, as well as voted for Appropriations as did the majority of members of this Committee. Now, in the FY14 Appropriations Act and the NDAA, we worked to secure $10 million in planning and design funds for the Missile Defense Agency to begin construction activities for a third homeland missile defense site at Fort Drum. My question to you, General Collins, is: As the Director of MDA, can you confirm to me that this $10 million is being used at Fort Drum as dictated by Congress as explicitly stated by Congress at Fort Drum to begin the planning and design of a third missile defense site? ”\\xa0 Lieutenant General Collins: “Ma’am, that $10 million has been authorized and appropriated for that purpose, and that’s the purpose we’re executing it for.” Congresswoman Stefanik: “And what are you using that for?” Lieutenant General Collins: “That is to do the initial planning and development of a design for continental interceptor site to take it to the 10 percent design level?” Congresswoman Stefanik: “At Fort Drum?” Lieutenant General Collins: “We are pursuing an agnostic design that would support–” Congresswoman Stefanik: “That’s not what the language said.” Lieutenant General Collins: “By doing it as an agnostic site, we would not slow down the capability to do it at Fort Drum.” Congresswoman Stefanik: “That’s not what the language that was passed by Congress said. And you understand that in the NDAA, for multiple years, it had designated Fort Drum. There were three sites under consideration in three different states. There was a process, an environmental impact study. This has been a very thorough process. And so you're saying to me today that the $10 million is not designated at Fort Drum for the planning and design?” Lieutenant General Collins: “It is. It supports a continental interceptor site at any location that's determined to be optimal in the future in line with the 2019 memo that the department signed out.”\\xa0 Congresswoman Stefanik: “Designating Fort Drum.” Lieutenant General Collins: “Fort Drum, and it also designated that when a requirement was set for a continental site that there would have to be a readdress and a reassessment of location based on performance.” Congresswoman Stefanik: “Even though you said in my office when we met, General Collins, in my office, that you understood that the $10 million would go to the design and planning at Fort Drum, as specified by the NDAA.” Lieutenant General Collins: “When a decision, if a decision is made to pursue a Fort Drum site, the $10 million will be 100 percent in line with being able to accomplish that.” Congresswoman Stefanik: “But you do understand that multiple NDAAs Fort Drum has been designated, as well as by DoD.”\\xa0\\xa0 Lieutenant General Collins: “I’m aware, ma’am, of the report the Department signed out and the previous NDAAs.” Congresswoman Stefanik: “Okay, great.

The outstanding abandoned mine land (AML) liabilities, or the estimated cost of the earth work needed to complete the reclamation of all remaining AML sites, in Illinois is currently $163 million.  \"Mining is an important part of our economy, but unused or abandoned mines present safety risks and leave opportunities for economic and land development on the table,\" said Rep. LaHood. \"The Community Reclamation Partnerships Act will enable partnerships\\xa0between states and nongovernmental entities to reclaim and restore land and water resources adversely affected by coal mining activities. I am proud this legislation passed the House unanimously, and urge the Senate to pass it swiftly.\" “H.R. 6233 enables non-governmental organizations to remediate abandoned mine lands across the country while also easing the burden on the taxpayers. Representative LaHood has championed this bipartisan, commonsense bill through the committee, and I thank him for his efforts to pass it through the House,\" said House Natural Resources Chairman Bruce Westerman.\\xa0 Background: Currently, states are responsible for these rehabilitation projects and receive funding from the AML Fund, supported by fees paid by coal operators. Given the project backlog and need in communities across the country, non-government organization have been encouraged and interested in contributing their time and resources to the effort, but are often deterred due to potential liability. To address this issue, under this bill, these entities would be recognized as “Community Reclaimers” and states would assume responsibility for all Community Reclaimer projects, just as they currently do for approved AML contractors. The legislation also sets up a process for recognizing agreements between states and federal agencies establishing approved practices at abandoned mine sites for Community Reclaimer projects. ###\\xa0 Permalink: https://lahood.house.gov/2024/4/lahood-s-community-reclamation-partnerships-act-passes-house-unanimously 1424 Longworth HOB Washington, DC 20515 Phone: (202) 225-6201 Fax: (202) 225-9249 100 NE Monroe Street Room 100 Peoria, IL 61602 Phone: (309) 671-7027 Fax: (309) 671-7309 527 Colman Center Drive Rockford, IL 61108 Phone: (779) 238-4785 108 East Beaufort Street Normal, IL 61761 Phone: (309) 445-8080 1715 North Division Street Suite E Morris, IL 60450',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced the first-ever federal rule limiting PFAS in drinking water, which will protect 100 million people from PFAS exposure. To support states and territories in detection of PFAS and implementation of this new national standard, the Biden-Harris Administration has also announced an additional $1 billion, made possible through President Biden’s Investing in American agenda. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)—also known as “forever chemicals”–are man-made chemicals that cannot be broken down. According to the CDC, 97% of Americans have at least some PFAS in their blood. Exposure to PFAS has been connected to several serious health issues, including cancers, liver and heart disease, and immune and developmental damage to infants and children. “PFAS is a serious environmental and health issue that has harmed communities in Pennsylvania, like mine, for decades—this new national standard is the first of its kind and will help fulfill our right to clean drinking water,” Rep. Dean said. “For too long, victims of PFAS exposure have suffered deadly cancers and other serious health issues. Because of tenacious advocates, who have educated the public and demanded change for decades, we can better protect our neighbors. I thank them for their tireless work toward environmental justice, and I commend the Biden Administration, especially the EPA, for this major step for the health and safety of\\xa0 communities and for future generations.” The new rule creates a Maximum Contaminant Level, or MCL, that is near zero. Ten states, including the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, have previously set MCLs; the EPA’s nationwide MCL is stricter and enforceable across all 50 states. As a former state Representative for Pennsylvania’s 153rd District and now as the U.S. Representative for Pennsylvania’s Fourth Congressional District, Congresswoman Dean has prioritized limiting PFAS, funding research on the health consequences of PFAS exposure, and holding those responsible for the manufacturing of these forever chemicals accountable. Most recently, she introduced the\\xa0PFAS Accountability Act to create a federal cause of action and allow courts to award medical monitoring for victims of PFAS exposure.  Rep.

       " 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – Congresswoman Madeleine Dean (PA-04) and Congressman Donald Beyer (VA-08) led a letter to urge the Biden Administration to extend Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to Ethiopians. The letter was signed by 44 other Members of Congress. TPS authority stems from the same deeply held principles that underpin the U.S. refugee and asylum systems—that the United States will not return people to situations where their lives or freedom will be threatened. A country is typically designated for TPS when conditions in the country fall into one or more of the three statutory bases for designation: ongoing armed conflict, environmental disasters, or extraordinary and temporary conditions. Since last year, a large-scale conflict has raged in Amhara, Ethiopia’s second largest region, leading the Ethiopian government to declare a state of emergency on August 4, 2023, and renew it on February 2, 2024. According to the International Organization for Migration, more than 3.45 million Ethiopians are internally displaced. And droughts have devastated communities—the UN expects the number of critically food insecure people to rise over the next few months, reaching 10.8 million by this summer.\\xa0\\xa0 “The conditions in Ethiopia remain dire; ongoing conflicts continue to pose serious threats to personal safety and drought continues to disrupt living conditions and exacerbate food insecurity and hunger,” the lawmakers wrote. “We call upon the administration to do its part to continue to protect Ethiopians in the United States from deportation by extending and redesignating Ethiopia for TPS.” Protections for Ethiopian TPS holders are set to expire on June 12, 2024. The lawmakers urged President Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to issue an immediate 18-month extension and redesignation. Read the full letter here.

       " 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – This morning, President Biden announced a final rule implementing the background check requirements in the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. The Department of Justice estimates that there are over 20,000 unlicensed sellers who are selling firearms through online advertisements, gun shows, and other means. Under the Biden Administration’s rule, these sellers must become licensed firearm dealers and therefore must run background checks on all sales. In 2022, Congresswoman Madeleine Dean (PA-04) voted along with more than 200 of her House colleagues to pass the Bipartisan\\xa0Safer Communities Act — the first gun violence prevention legislation in nearly 30 nears. And in December 2023, Congresswoman Dean led 160 of her colleagues in urging President Biden to finalize this rule. The letter can be found here. “When we passed the Safer Communities Act, we had just lost ten people in Buffalo, and 19 students and two teachers in Uvalde, to gun violence. This is a uniquely American problem — a problem that led me to run for public office in the first place,\" said Rep. Dean. \"The Safer Communities Act is a meaningful action that we must build upon. I applaud the President for implementing it as strongly as possible to save lives.” Specifically, the rule: Lists the types of commercial activity indicating that a person must become a licensed dealer and run background checks; States that the gun show or online sale loopholes do not exist; Prevents people from evading the licensing and background check requirements by claiming that they are just selling a few guns; Prevents people from falsely claiming that guns are part of a personal collection to evade the law; and Closes the firesale loophole.

The announcement comes after Stanton and Grijalva sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne Criswell, urging them to quickly allocate funding under the replenished SSP and ensure border communities were prioritized.  Maricopa County will receive $11,606,329, Pima County will receive $21,827,581, World Hunger in Maricopa will receive $11,606,329, and World Hunger in Yuma will receive $9,532,854.  “This funding couldn’t come soon enough. I’ve visited local aid groups along the border, and they’re near a breaking point—over-stretching their budgets to help care for migrant families and prevent street releases,” Stanton said. “I’ll keep working to make sure Arizona communities get their fair share of federal resources to manage this crisis.”  “I appreciate the Biden administration’s swiftness to allocate this federal funding to Arizona. I will continue to work with federal, state, local, and non-governmental organizations to ensure this funding is distributed expeditiously. As Southern Arizona communities continue to deal with the humanitarian crisis, it’s critical we provide them with the resources and funding they need,” Grijalva said. “It’s clear that the only path forward to address these issues long-term is real immigration reform to fix our broken system beginning with humane solutions, increased legal pathways, dealing with root causes, and providing more resources and personnel at the border instead of Republicans’ detrimental funding cuts and failed enforcement-only policies.”  FEMA also announced several key changes to the program—including two common-sense fixes Stanton urged Biden Administration officials to make in a December letter.

       " \"WASHINGTON, DC – Today, Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-1) and Joaquin Castro (TX-20) introduced the Enhancing Development Finance Corporation Oversight Act of 2024, bipartisan legislation that would grant law enforcement authority to the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the United States International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) in order to improve oversight and accountability of U.S. foreign aid programs. Six years ago, Reps. Fitzpatrick and Castro helped to establish the DFC as co-sponsors of the 2018 Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development Act (BUILD) Act. To ensure appropriate oversight over taxpayer dollars expended through the DFC, the BUILD Act simultaneously established the DFC OIG with a mission to prevent, detect, and deter waste, fraud, and abuse in DFC programs and operations. Until 2020, when the DFC OIG became operational, the OIG for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) provided oversight for DFC programs. While the USAID OIG has federal law enforcement authorities to conduct criminal investigations, including the authority to make arrests and obtain and execute search warrants, the DFC OIG does not currently possess these same authorities, constraining its oversight power. “The International Development Finance Corporation Office of Inspector General (DFC OIG) must be given law enforcement authority in order to properly provide oversight of its programs,” said Congressman Fitzpatrick. “I am proud to co-lead this bipartisan legislation with Rep. Castro that would improve oversight and accountability of U.S. foreign aid programs by granting the DFC OIG further authority to reduce unnecessary misuse of resources.” “Across the federal government, strong Inspectors General play an essential role in rooting out fraud and maintaining trust in government programs. As U.S. global development projects continue to expand, Congress needs to ensure that DFC’s OIG has the tools to maintain the highest level of integrity in DFC’s operations. This bipartisan bill will help the United States set a strong example of good governance at home and abroad, and I am thankful to Congressman Fitzpatrick for his partnership on this much-needed bipartisan reform,” said Congressman Castro. “I applaud Congressman Joaquin Castro and Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick for re-introducing the Enhancing Development Finance Corporation Oversight Act, which will provide the DFC’s Office of Inspector General with the needed law enforcement authorities to identify and eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse. As a strong proponent of the DFC, I believe it is critical that the agency's IG have the full suite of tools to properly conduct oversight of the agency's operations.\\xa0 I commend Reps. Castro and Fitzpatrick for their leadership on this important issue, and I urge Congress to enact this legislation,” said former Congressman Ted Yoho, lead author of the BUILD Act. “This bipartisan measure gives the DFC’s Office of Inspector General the same authority other federal OIG’s have to ensure strong oversight and accountability of agency projects,” said Rob Mosbacher, Jr., a member of the Modernizing Foreign Assistance Network member who served as President and CEO of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) from 2005 to 2009. “I commend Congressman Castro and Fitzpatrick for their leadership.” Law enforcement authorities for Inspectors General are generally granted through the Inspector General Act of 1978, which outlines a process by which the U.S. Attorney General can delegate these authorities. The Department of Justice has indicated that it has no objections to providing law enforcement authority to the DFC OIG but has not moved to grant such authority. The Enhancing Development Finance Corporation Oversight Act of 2024 would restore appropriate law enforcement oversight to the DFC and ensure that agency programs continue to operate with integrity and efficiency.

This follows Minnesota House Republicans’\\xa0initial letter\\xa0to Secretary Mayorkas surrounding the alarming\\xa0report\\xa0that a member of Al-Shabaab was allowed to roam the country for nearly a year before being arrested in Minnesota. In case you missed it…Known terrorist spent year in US after being wrongly released by feds — and GOP lawmakers demand answersNew York PostJennie TaerApril 2, 2024https://nypost.com/2024/04/02/us-news/lawmakers-demand-to-know-if-taxpayers-funded-al-shabaab-terrorist/  A Somali terrorist was allowed into the country and able to operate freely for almost a year before authorities realized their error and re-arrested him.  Republican lawmakers are now demanding information from Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas about what happened to the man – and whether US citizens funded any part of his journey or stay in the US.  The 27-year-old Somalian – who has so far not been identified by name – was on the watchlist as “a confirmed member of al Shabaab” involved in the use, manufacturing or transportation of explosives or firearms, but a border bungle meant he was released after initially being arrested for crossing into the country illegally in California in March 2023.  A letter from Republican lawmakers seeks to find the al-Shabaab member’s path from illegally crossing the border to Minnesota, were he was eventually re-arrested in January, and if he received any government benefits.  It also seeks to find if he took a commercial flight with US citizens to reach their state and if his travel was funded with taxpayer dollars according to the Tuesday letter, first obtained by The Post.  The letter states: “Due to Minnesota’s far distance from the border, it is not an easy task for migrants to travel to the state…  “Did the al-Shabbab terrorist travel to Minnesota with the assistance, either direct or indirect of an [Non-Governmental Organization]? If so, which NGO was responsible for transporting the individual to Minnesota?”  The terrorist organization member had initially crossed into California and been arrested by Border Patrol. However, the Terrorist Screening Center determined he was a “mismatch” to the terror watchlist leading to his release.  Nearly a year later, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) nabbed him after federal authorities made a “redetermination” and released he was associated with the Somalian militant group, designated a terror organization by the National Counterterrorism Center.  In a February press conference, ICE Acting Director Patrick Lechleitner said his agency arrested the individual “within 48 hours” of learning his true identity.  “The Biden administration’s open-borders agenda allowed a known terrorist to roam freely throughout our state, and now they must answer for their inexcusable negligence,” House Majority Whip Tom Emmer said in a statement to The Post regarding the probe.  Border Patrol has recorded an ever-growing number of migrants listed on the terror watchlist attempting to enter the US illegally in recent years.  Between October 2023 and February, agents have already recorded 70 encounters at both the southern and northern borders, according to federal data.  There were 172 such encounters recorded in fiscal year 2023, which ran from October 2022 to September 2023, 98 in fiscal year 2022, 16 in fiscal year 2021 and 14 between fiscal years 2017 and 2020.  In March, Border Patrol agents apprehended Lebanese national Basel Bassel Ebbadi, 22, who told personnel that he came to the US “to try to make a bomb,” according to internal federal documents first obtained by The Post.  Ebbadi admitted to a border agent he is a member of Hezbollah and was later confirmed as a “positive match” on the terror watchlist.  ###  Permalink: https://emmer.house.gov/2024/4/icymi-emmer-minnesota-house-republicans-demand-answers-on-al-shabaab-terrorist-s-travel-to-minnesota',\n",

Carol Miller (R-W.Va.-01) and Yadira Caraveo (D-Colo.-08), introduced the\\xa0Preserving Emergency Access in Key Sites\\xa0Act (PEAKS Act). The legislation would allow Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs)\\xa0in rural, mountainous areas\\xa0to be able to operate ambulatory services under a special enhanced Medicare payment model. The bill would also help to preserve the CAH model in mountainous areas by providing more flexible requirements for these unique hospitals. “As residents of the Mountain State, we are proud of our beautiful peaks. At the same time, we are also aware of the challenges our mountainous topography can cause for transportation, including ambulances,”\\xa0Senator Capito said.\\xa0“The\\xa0PEAKS Act\\xa0addresses this challenge and will ensure even our most rural residents can depend on ambulance services and our critical access hospitals are able to provide the care these residents need and deserve.” “The Appalachian region, which West Virginia lies completely within, has one of the highest shares of people living in ambulance deserts than any other region in the country,”\\xa0Senator Manchin said.\\xa0“I’m proud to introduce the bipartisan, bicameral\\xa0PEAKS Act\\xa0to ensure every West Virginian and American living in mountainous areas are able to reliably depend on ambulance services during an emergency. Our legislation would also allow rural hospitals to receive the reimbursements they deserve for providing life-saving services to their communities and protect them from losing their unique status. I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this important, commonsense bill and I will do everything I can to get it across the finish line and signed into law.”\\xa0 “Everyone, regardless of where they live, should have access to quality and affordable health care. My home state of West Virginia has more Critical Access Hospitals in mountainous areas than any other state in the country, and I know how hard it can be for those who live in rural, mountainous regions to receive treatment in a timely manner. The\\xa0Preserving Emergency Access in Key Sites Act (PEAKS Act)\\xa0is life-saving legislation that will ensure Critical Access Hospitals in mountainous areas are compensated fairly for the ambulatory services they provide to patients and positively impact rural communities across the nation. It’s imperative that all patients, especially those that live in unforgiving terrain, can access emergency medical care,” Rep. Miller said. “Every Coloradan deserves access to emergency medical services regardless of where they live, and hospitals deserve proper compensation for their risky and often life-saving care,”\\xa0Rep. Caraveo said.\\xa0“It’s high time for us to pass the\\xa0PEAKS Act, which would ensure that the cost of ambulance services is covered all across Colorado.” BACKGROUND: CAHs\\xa0are a unique designation intended for the most rural type of hospital.\\xa0Currently, CAHs in mountainous areas are not being reimbursed for providing ambulatory services under the enhanced Medicare payment model. This legislation would correct that error and reimburse CAHs for ambulatory services when there is\\xa0no other ambulatory base within 15 miles of the facility. This would help to ensure these CAHs are not operating at a financial loss or struggling to support the flow or transportation of patients in their hospitals, and more areas of rural West Virginia and America would have access to ambulances.\\xa0 The bill also protects CAHs currently located in mountainous areas to ensure they will not lose their designation even if a new facility is constructed within 15 miles.\\xa0Construction in geographically mountainous areas is difficult and sometimes results in the need for flexibility in mileage requirements to preserve access to care in these rural areas.

However, I am a bit concerned about the administration and some of the neglect I've seen in the major flaws in the air monitoring data quality. “It seems as though the administration is prioritizing an agenda while misallocating taxpayer dollars on projects that have limited benefits to our public health and welfare. “First, I think it is important to acknowledge that Americans enjoy some of the cleanest air in the world and recognize just how much air pollution in the United States has been reduced. “According to the EPA, between 1980 and 2022, the combined emissions of criteria air pollutants and precursor pollutants was reduced by 73 percent. “Hazardous air pollutant emissions have also similarly declined. “Despite this fact, many Americans are led to believe through inaccurate claims that our air quality is getting worse when, in fact, air quality has significantly improved and can get better. “Congress has made significant investments to support the ambient air quality monitoring network, the federal government partners with states, localities, and Tribes to build and operate the system. “This network is comprised of official stationary air monitors that gather data to inform regulatory decisions and determine regulatory compliance. “While use of these official monitors has been generally successful, deficiencies with one model’s accuracy and reliability demonstrate the need to ensure that the monitoring system is maintained at the highest standards and is the most accurate it can be. “One year ago, EPA modified a measurement method of the Teledyne PM Mass Monitor, used to track and measure particulate matter. “These monitors are crucial to inform potential regulatory actions undertaken by the EPA and the states, including implementation of the national ambient air quality standards or the NAAQS. “Peer-reviewed analysis reported that the monitors had led to over-inflated measures of fine particulate matter, or PM 2.5. “In other words, the monitors led the EPA and states to believe that the air quality was worse than it actually was. “These artificially high readings date all the way back to 2017 when they were first deployed. “Those Teledyne monitors had a significantly high bias relative to other monitors, including the ‘gold standard’ reference monitor that the chairman spoke about. “On February 14th of this year, the EPA issued a proposal to retroactively modify PM 2.5 data reported from the Teledyne monitors from when they were first deployed from the years of 2017 through April 2023. “The EPA proposal notes that the more than 400 Teledyne monitors in our official [ambient] air monitoring network were consistently producing PM 2.5 data that was 20 percent higher than the real concentration levels. “To be clear, this level of inaccuracy could be stated as unprecedented. “It is absolutely critical that EPA prioritize correcting this unprecedented error, which they are doing, and refocus on providing high-quality, accurate monitoring data that is relied on for regulatory compliance. “This is where the EPA’s focus should be in a monitoring context before the agency promotes the use of emerging, and less accurate, sensors. “Despite the challenges faced by the existing network used for regulatory purposes, there has been a choice to prioritize funding for less-accurate, difficult to use, low-cost monitors. “The partisan American Rescue Plan and Inflation Reduction Act funded the use of less accurate and reliable, low-cost air quality sensors. “A recent GAO report identified key challenges and data deficiencies associated with use of those low-quality air sensors. “GAO found that users face difficulties understanding the capabilities, operations, and maintenance requirements and accuracy of those sensors. “Particularly, GAO noted users often lack the knowledge to select the right sensors or deploy them in a way that best fits their intended use to gain accurate and actionable data. “This leads to confusion when the data lacks the high-degree of confidence necessary to make regulatory decisions and can cause misunderstandings about the concentration of air pollutants that are affecting local communities. “Of particular concern GAO points out [is] that the EPA has not taken basic steps to address issues with sensor use, such as issuing guidance on how to make the sensors more usable for communities. “This confusion can undermine confidence in EPA and state regulatory actions, as well as cause our communities and residents to panic about their air quality and misallocated resources. “I am concerned that spending more money on new, unproven, and inaccurate monitors that can’t be used reliably to direct our regulatory action will at best be a waste of money or a misplaced priority. “Instead, we need to make improvements in the existing monitoring network so that we can build on the substantial progress we have made to improve our air quality. “With that, I yield back.” #

WASHINGTON, D.C. – This morning, U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference and a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, joined CNBC’s “Squawk Box”\\xa0to discuss TikTok and the national security threat it poses. During the interview, Senator Capito also expressed her support for the divestment of TikTok from ByteDance, its current owners who are subject to the will of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). HIGHLIGHTS: ON THE NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT POSED BY TIKOK: “Well, I think it's obvious that the structure of TikTok is constructed, with ByteDance being the owner, to comply with the Chinese intelligence laws. That means that you are required as a company to share your data with the CCP, and I think in this case of TikTok, it’s so widely used. I think it would create— it has created a great vulnerability not just for our young people, but for everybody. And so, all we're asking in this bill is that the ownership change and become domestic and TikTok can, you know, move forward with the good things that TikTok does. And so, I am very concerned about the effect- that long-term effect, but also the short-term effect and what data is already in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.” ON IF THE BIPARTISAN TIKTOK DIVESTMENT BILL WILL PASS THE SENATE: “You know, I don't understand why [Senator] Schumer is not taking it up. I thought Leader McConnell was very forceful on it. It was an overwhelming vote in the House and so I expect it to come before the floor, and I expect it to pass, and the president says he would sign it.” ON HOW REAL THE THREAT IS TO AMERICANS: “Well, I think because of the ownership structure, and the competition, and the will of the Chinese government itself to become the most powerful economy in the world, causing, I think, a great threat to us, as Americans,absolutely the threat is there. I think, also, when I talk about this publicly, I got a lot of parents who are concerned about the direction that TikTok is taking their children, and I can tell you in my own personal Senate office: hundreds of calls from 11-year-olds, 12-year-olds.They're being channeled by TikTok into their Senate office so [TikTok knows] where you live, because they're telling me- you know, they're calling my office and they live in my state, and they're saying, you know, ‘please don't ban TikTok.’ ON IF THE CCP IS CURRENTLY HARVESTING AMERICANS’ DATA IN A WAY THAT THREATENS THE U.S.: “Well, I think we've seen reports that [CCP data harvesting of Americans is] moving forward, but I'm not naive enough to think that that's not what they're doing. I mean, I think we have to guard against the possible and I think that is not just a small possibility, but it's a large possibility. Look, we have an election coming up. We have all these geopolitical things that are going on that I'm sure the Chinese would try to sway the American thought process in a lot of these things. And if they have our data, which I am certain that they do, and you know, let's see. Let's just get real here: data never dies. They had it before, before they separated and created this Texas company, they probably have ways to have it now. I don't think you can believe what they say. And so, I'm in the category of a very skeptical person who believes that China has goals in mind that would fit very nicely with capturing as much data here in this country as they possibly could, however they would do it.” # # # \\nTags: \\nEconomy, Homeland Security\\n\",\n",

WASHINGTON, D.C.\\xa0– Today, the U.S. Senate passed a measure co-sponsored by Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Ranking Member of the Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, and sponsored by Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Ranking Member of EPW’s Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee, to overturn the Biden administration’s illegal greenhouse emissions performance measure final rule being imposed on state departments of transportation (DOTs) and metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs).\\xa0The Senate approved the Congressional Review Act (CRA) joint\\xa0resolution of disapproval\\xa0by a vote of 53-47. In 2023, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) issued a rule mandating that state DOTs and MPOs set declining emissions targets, attempting to use authority that was specifically excluded from the bipartisan\\xa0Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act\\xa0that became law in 2021. Cramer and Capito introduced the CRA resolution in\\xa0February\\xa0of this year. This year, two federal district courts also ruled that the performance measure was not authorized by law. “Today, the Senate rejected the Biden administration’s attempt to ignore the letter of the bipartisan infrastructure law and impose its extreme climate agenda on states across the country,”\\xa0Ranking Member Capito said.\\xa0“Beyond the economic harm a greenhouse gas emissions requirement would cause, the main problem with the FHWA issuing this regulation is it simply lacks the authority to do so. I’m glad a bipartisan group of colleagues joined us in sending a clear message to the administration that we will continue to hold them accountable for executive overreach.” A companion version of the resolution of disapproval was introduced in the House of Representatives in February, led by US.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference and member of the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, delivered remarks on the Senate floor reiterating the need for Senate Democrats to conduct a full impeachment trial for U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. During her remarks, Senator Capito referenced the constitutional duty given to the U.S. Senate to try all impeachments delivered by the U.S. House of Representatives, detailed the catastrophe at the southern border that has developed as a result of Secretary Mayorkas’ failure to uphold the law, and reiterated the decision to take up these articles of impeachment lies with Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Senate Democrats Also this week, Senator Capito penned an op-ed for the Washington Examiner to express the need for the Senate to seriously consider these impeachment articles. Click here to read the senator’s op-ed. Senator Capito’s remarks, as prepared for delivery, are included below:  “Mr./Madame President,  “I rise today during a historic time for this chamber.  “Soon, the U.S. House of Representatives is expected to send over Articles of Impeachment against a Cabinet Officer for only the second time in our nation’s history.  “This is not routine business. Instead, this is a serious moment. “On February 13th, the House agreed to Articles of Impeachment against Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for ‘willful and systemic refusal to comply with the law’ and ‘breach of public trust.’ “This chamber will soon have a constitutional duty to uphold and I firmly believe that the Senate must conduct a full impeachment trial for Secretary Mayorkas.  “Our Constitution gives the Senate responsibility and duty ‘to try all Impeachments’ and \\xa0it requires a vote of two-thirds of Senators present before the federal officer is convicted, a high standard for a serious constitutional process. “For every impeachment in our history, the Senate has held some form of a trial, unless the federal officer resigned prior to trial. This time should be no different.  “Under President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas, there have been more than 9.2 million illegal crossings along our country’s southern border. Or, to put it another way, the average monthly encounters have increase almost 400% under the Biden-Mayorkas DHS. “The record 189,922 illegal crossings in February marked the seventh consecutive month of the highest number of encounters those months had ever seen. And on top of this, there have been 36 straight months with higher encounters at the southern border than any month under President Trump’s administration. “These numbers are shocking, but unfortunately, these statistics have become a regular occurrence under the leadership of Secretary Mayorkas, who bears the responsibility for the worst border crisis in our nation’s history. “Let me be clear: This crisis did not happen by accident. We have seen the Biden-Mayorkas DHS fail to uphold the law and secure our borders, starting on Day One of this administration.  “This broad and willful effort by the Biden administration to open our borders began by ending successful Trump-era policies like contracts to build the border wall, ‘Remain in Mexico,’ also known as ‘Migrant Protection Protocols’ or ‘MPP,” and Safe Third Country agreements. “Again, the numbers don’t lie, and they certainly do not provide the administration any cover. Unlike the cover the administration gives daily to the cartels who are making billions from their human smuggling and drug-trafficking operations as long as this crisis continues. “Furthermore, we have seen Secretary Mayorkas abuse the parole process, expanding the program more than any prior administration, which has led to more than 1 million migrants coming into our country who would otherwise be inadmissible.  “Parole is supposed to be granted on a ‘case-by-case’ basis, but under Secretary Mayorkas’ leadership, DHS has created categorical parole programs to give entry to migrants from many South American and Caribbean countries with minimal vetting.\\xa0 “As this crisis has developed throughout President Biden’s three years in office, nearly half of the migrants encountered on our southern border are coming from countries outside of Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. “The immigration crisis on our southern border is now more multifaceted than ever and the open-border policies from the Biden-Mayorkas DHS has allowed that to happen. We truly have no idea who is entering our country illegally. “Now, 336 individuals on the terror watch list have illegally crossed our southern border during the Biden administration and these are just the individuals we are aware of.  “To put this into perspective, only 14 terror suspects were apprehended between ports of entry during the Trump administration. Not knowing who is in our country is a national security crisis, and at a time of heighted national security risk, that is a chance we cannot be willing to take.  “We have also seen the Biden-Mayorkas DHS abuse the asylum process, expanding eligibility to admit\\xa0a record number of asylum seekers which has led to creating a decade-long backlog in our immigration courts.  “This ensures that anyone who enters our country and passes the very low screening standard will be here for years without any fear of deportation. This policy allowed the alleged killer of Laken Riley, a nursing student in Georgia who was brutally and senselessly murdered, to enter and remain in country.  “This will forever serve as a reminder that Secretary Mayorkas’ catch-and-release policies have allowed the catastrophe at our southern border to impact every community. “When our already overwhelmed border patrol agents are faced with thousands of encounters per day of migrants claiming asylum, we know that some border crossers are going to slip through. These are the people who do not want to be caught and they are the individuals we need to worry about the most. “But, don’t just take my word for it. In a recent interview, Border Patrol Chief Jason Owens referred to the situation at the southern border as a ‘national security threat,’ and that the 140,000 known got-aways are what is ‘keeping me up at night.’ “This is something that all of us should be concerned about and the ripple effect this causes in communities far away from our southern border. Additionally, the drugs flowing across our border are responsible for fueling the addiction epidemic that has devastated communities across this country, including my state of West Virginia. “In West Virginia, it is estimated that during calendar year 2023, 1,327 residents died at the hands of illicit drugs. At the national level, the numbers are just as startling. “According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, agents seized an all-time record of 27,293 pounds of fentanyl coming across the southern border in FY23. That amount of fentanyl is enough to kill close to 6 million people.  “However, what is even more troubling is that CBP reported that federal officials estimated that they were only able to seize between 5% and 10% of all fentanyl smuggled across the southern border.\\xa0 “With a border patrol stretched unfathomably thin with very little support from the administration. There is no telling the amount of drugs that are getting through undetected.\\xa0 “Now, regarding the matter that will soon be before the Senate, the impeachment articles against Secretary Mayorkas make serious allegations and detail the crisis we have all see unfolding for more than three years.  “It is unconscionable for Senator Schumer and Senate Democrats to dismiss these charges without allowing the Senate to hear the evidence. Doing so would deny this body from upholding our constitutional duty to hear a case and decide whether or not Secretary Mayorkas should be convicted or acquitted. “The decision to take up these articles of impeachment lies with Senator Schumer and Senate Democrats. They must do the right thing and conduct a full trial. “With that, I yield the floor.” # # #',\n",
       " \" To watch Senator Capito’s questioning, click here or the image above. WASHINGTON, D.C. – Earlier this week, U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, questioned U.S. Secretary of the Air Force Hon. Frank Kendall, U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David W. Allvin, and U.S. Space Force Chief of Space Operations Gen. B. Chance Saltzman on the U.S. Air Force’s and U.S Space Force’s respective budget requests for Fiscal Year (FY) 2025. During the hearing, Senator Capito asked about Space Force cooperation with commercial partners like the Green Bank Observatory on space domain awareness, tradeoffs in the FY 2025 budget, and current military readiness of Air Force service members and equipment. HIGHLIGHTS:  ON SPACE FORCE PARTNERSHIPS AND WEST VIRGINIA SPACE EXPERTISE: SEN. CAPITO: “We do know that space domain awareness is essential for our military operations in space. And for many operations rely on space-based assets like our satellite communications, obviously, in the- in the non-military space. So, cislunar space domain awareness has also increased in importance. How is the Space Force collaborating with private sector, academic, and interagency partners to leverage the space domain awareness arena and capabilities?” GEN. SALTZMAN: “I can't emphasize this enough: avoiding operational surprise in the space domain is one of our top priorities. The foundation of avoiding operational surprise is access to data that is collected by a number of sensors. We, organically, have many of those in the Space Force, but we rely on industry, commercial services, commercial data capabilities. We rely on allies, international partners. The more data you have on the space domain, the better you're able to make sense of what's going on. And so, we spend money on it. We have it [as] a part of our commercial space strategy to make sure we can incorporate that data, and we're committed to it.” SEN. CAPITO: “Is that an increasing capability that you- I mean, it seems to me that would be ever expanding?” GEN. SALTZMAN: “You know, it is ever-expanding. And so, one of the things that I'm starting to realize now is: as we increase the amount of data that we're pulling in from other sensors, we have to be able to make sense of that data.” SEN. CAPITO: “I understand, too, that there is some emerging cooperation between the Space Force and the Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia. So, I'd like to stay in touch with you [Gen. Saltzman] on those capabilities, and because of the radio astronomy that we have out there and have had out there for decades, so [I’m] excited about those possibilities.” ON THE BUDGET REQUEST ASSUMING RISK IN MODERNIZATION, READINESS: SEN. CAPITO: “Secretary Kendall, nice to see you again. You wrote in your statement, something stuck out to me. It says ‘the Air Force is accepting risk across the service’s modernization accounts, in order to maintain minimally accepted near-term operational readiness. This places additional risk on the Air Force's ability to deter and defeat any adversary going forward.’ Obviously, what caught my eye, or ear, on that, is the ‘minimally accepted.’ Is that the standard where we are now? And I think that is a minimally accepted standard- I can't even imagine that that's actually an accepted standard, the way you phrased it, so could you explain that to me a little bit in more depth?” SEC. KENDALL: “The availability of our aircraft right now sits at around 60%. To me, that's a minimally acceptable number. It actually dipped a little below that. I have the most recent data here [on a notecard], in part driven by the fact that the V-22 fleet is still not back in the air, it’s in the process of getting back in the air. But nevertheless, this is driven by a number of things. It's driven largely by supply chain, driven by, you know, availability of depot for throughput, but it's driven by money, as much as anything… So, we're not where we'd like to be in terms of availability, in terms of current readiness. But it's an acceptable level, because we can meet our commitments around the world. We can do the things we anticipate that the joint- that the joint force may be asked to do, and as far as the air component, particularly in the space components, are concerned. We can't- the point I'm trying to make with what I said in the statement is: we can't go below that, we need to stay there. And that, you know, what happened to us in [FY 2025], in particular, was that our plans were scaled back a little bit because of the Fiscal Responsibility Act. We support that act. It was a- it was acceptable to us, but we're not moving forward with modernization under it as quickly as I'd like to. We are sustaining the current fleet at a level which is acceptable. We have our foundational accounts, weapon systems sustainment, the care of our facilities, our flying hours at levels which we could accept and we could live with, but long-term, they will be problematic for us. So, as we look out over the next few years, we're going to have to try to do better in some of those accounts, but it's acceptable for this year, for [FY 2025] …” # # #\",\n",

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Yesterday, U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), a member of the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, questioned U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on the agency’s budget requests for Fiscal Year (FY) 2025.During the hearing, Senator Capito pressed Secretary Mayorkas on cuts to Transportation Security Administration (TSA) programs at local West Virginia airports, efforts to interdict deadly fentanyl crossing the southern border, and border patrol officer recruitment, retention, and morale. This Appropriations hearing was to review the overall proposed budget of DHS.In addition to yesterday’s budget hearing, Senator Capito spoke on the Senate floor about the failures of the Biden administration when it comes to border security and immigration policy. Senator Capito also penned an op-ed for the Washington Examiner calling for a full impeachment trial of Secretary Mayorkas and joined 42 of her Senate Republican colleagues in sending a letter to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) on the subject as well.HIGHLIGHTS: ON CRITICAL TSA PROGRAMS BEING CUT AT WEST VIRGINIA AIRPORTS:SEN. CAPITO: “I do want to get to this one for my seven airports that lost your TSA law enforcement reimbursement program, where all commercial- all of our seven commercial airports relied on for various law enforcement services. Small airports just aren't able to provide this- the manpower here and obviously we were relying on this. What do you say to those airports across the country where this was cut, and now have $100-150,000… holes in their budgets to try to do this? What was the reasoning behind that? Certainly, it doesn't sound like a safety issue. It doesn't sound like it's making our airports more safe?”SEC. MAYORKAS: “With respect to the airports in your jurisdiction, I'll have to follow up with you on that. From a fundamental policy perspective, if we had the resources, we would devote the personnel to-”SEN. CAPITO: “Well apparently you have had the resources in the past and these were just cut this year. Our airport was notified maybe a month ago that- maybe when we passed this last [appropriations] bill that our- that their help with law enforcement agent- So that would be like if somebody's coming through TSA and there's a gun in a backpack found, for instance, that law enforcement agent then would come in and help the TSA do whatever the local law enforcement would be doing, and apparently we're missing that, and it seems like a pretty critical aspect.”SEC. MAYORKAS: “Senator, I addressed this issue last year, I believe. I am disappointed to hear that it remains an issue. I will circle back with you after I address it internally.”ON BORDER PATROL AGENT RECRUITMENT, RETENTION, AND MORALE:SEN. CAPITO: “I would like to know, with the significant amount of funding that you were- that you were granted, what is the number of border agents right now? Is it going up? Is it at your max? What, you're allowed to have 21,370, I believe? So, where are you on that?”SEC. MAYORKAS: “We are hiring actively, Senator Capito. I will have to get to you the specific number. I concur with you that it's not just personnel that is going to solve the challenge at our southern border, which is why the bipartisan [national security supplemental] not only included additional resources, but also fundamentally needed legislative changes that would have really changed the system and the number of people we encounter in the first instance.”SEN. CAPITO: “How's the morale and retention? I mean, is that an issue, obviously, when you're trying to recruit? It’s got to be.”SEC. MAYORKAS: “Morale has been an issue in our Department of Homeland Security ever since I joined it, and well before then. We are very focused on workforce well-being and are hoping that the well-being of our treasured employees is actually strengthening and improving, despite the stresses and strains they undergo in their very difficult work.”SEN. CAPITO: “Yeah, well, I'm assuming- I would assume that you would know whether you were close to your peak to the allowable amount of agents. I mean, are you close to that number? Are you far away? Are you losing more people than you're gaining? Give me a sense of that.”SEC. MAYORKAS: “We are close. We are close, but I don't want to misspeak and cite a figure that would not be accurate to you, and I will provide that to you with swiftness.”ON FENTANYL INTERDICTION CAPABILITIES AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER:SEN. CAPITO: “This autonomous surveillance towers issue is something I think would be helpful if you've got manpower shortages, if people are coming between the ports, they obviously are. Apparently, your budget has not reflected any kind of plus-up in that area that would fortify and help us interdict in those areas. What's your position on the autonomous surveillance towers and how helpful they have been, and would be, as force multipliers?”SEC. MAYORKAS: “Senator, the automated surveillance towers, the ASTs, have been force multipliers. They have been effective. We are focusing, right now, our resources on the non-intrusive inspection technology, given the fact that the great majority of fentanyl that is smuggled into our country comes in through the ports of entry in commercial trucks and passenger vehicles.”SEN. CAPITO: “I think you told me last time that the- I did ask about how many trucks were being interdicted or, I mean, inspected and you noted that 70%, but you didn't give me an exact figure at that time, but, let’s see, what percentage of cars are actually screened for drugs coming through the ports of entry? Do you have an update on that? Or does that sound like the same figure as last year? Or has it gone up? SEC. MAYORKAS: “I apologize, Senator, I'll give you that data.”SEN. CAPITO: “Okay.

       " 'CHARLESTON, W.Va. – Yesterday, U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), joined 42 of her Senate Republican colleagues in sending a letter – led by U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) – to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) calling on the Senate to fulfill its constitutional duty by holding a trial to consider the impeachment of U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.“The House of Representatives has considered this evidence and impeached Secretary Mayorkas.\\xa0Our constitutional duty requires the Senate to hold a trial.\\xa0In every previous congressional impeachment of the past 227 years, Congress has been faithful to the process set out by the framers… Never before has the Senate abandoned this duty, even when certain members believed the basis for impeachment was tenuous at best,” the senators wrote.“In the face of the disaster that mounts daily at our southern border, and in communities across America, the House of Representatives has formally accused Alejandro Mayorkas of demeaning his office. The American people deserve to hear the evidence through a Senate trial in the Court of Impeachment,” the senators continued.Full text of the letter is available here. Senator Capito, who also serves on the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee and as the vice chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, led a number of her Republican colleagues in a series of speeches on the Senate floor and spoke about this during the weekly Senate Republican leadership press conference.

       " 'For far too long, Washington Democrats and the liberal media have worked hand-in-hand to mislead Americans about the situation on our border. They say that the border is secure and that Biden’s agenda is working. And if you don’t believe them, they call you ignorant – or even worse – racist. We saw a panel on MSNBC mock Virginia Republicans who listed the border as a top priority during coverage of Super Tuesday. More recently, a Democrat in Congress told the audience at a candidate forum to \"forget the border\" and called it a \"Republican talking point and a distraction.\"  Washington Democrats and the liberal media are wrong on every level. A recent poll found that Americans believe the border crisis is the most important problem facing our nation. In another recent poll, 73% of respondents said they want the Biden administration to “make it tougher to get in the U.S. illegally.” Interestingly, that includes 56% of Democrats and 78% of independents.  The truth is that the American people know that our border is in absolute chaos. And they are sick and tired of the Left and liberal media trying to protect Biden from being held accountable for creating the worst border crisis in history. Americans know that the reason we’ve had more than 10 million illegal border entries under Biden is because he took a sledgehammer to former President Donald Trump’s effective immigration agenda. Let’s start with Biden’s move to reinstate catch-and-release, one of the most damaging – and dangerous – examples of his border policies. Hospitals, shelters, and schools are getting overwhelmed because they can’t handle the massive influx of illegal immigrants. What’s also alarming is that in many cases, we have no idea who these individuals are. According to a county official in San Diego, a “minimum” of 125,000 illegal immigrants have been released from detention “without proper vetting” onto the city’s streets in just a span of six months. Without sufficient vetting, there is no way to know if the people coming across the border are dangerous criminals or evil terrorists. On Day One of his administration, Biden made the reckless decision to cancel construction of Trump’s border wall. Back in March, we saw a shocking video where illegal immigrants broke through razor wire then overpowered the Texas National Guard at the El Paso border. In addition to ending construction on Trump’s border wall, the Biden administration is doing everything it can to stop Texas Governor Greg Abbott from taking matters into his own hands by putting up his own wall along the border.  In 2022, Biden got rid of Remain in Mexico, one of the most effective border policies put in place by the Trump administration. When I led a group of my Republican colleagues on a fact-finding mission to the southern border a few years ago, border patrol officials told us that Remain in Mexico, which held illegals seeking asylum on the other side of the border versus being released in the U.S., was one of the most important tools in curbing incentives to illegally cross into our nation.  While the Left and liberal media continue to mislead and insult the American people, House Republicans are fighting tooth and nail to advance the policies we need to end this crisis. As your congressman, you can rest assured that I will NEVER stop fighting to make our border secure again.',\n",

The DOT funding will support a study that recommends short-term projects for completion in 3-5 years, review land-use policies, and integrate nature-based solutions into the design and operations of the construction work. The funds are made possible through the Infrastructure Law, which Heinrich and\\xa0Luján helped pass into law.\\xa0 “Investing in working families includes doubling down on efforts to lower energy costs, strengthen the local workforce, and build resilient infrastructure,”\\xa0said Heinrich. “I’m proud to welcome $2.5 million in federal funds for Doña Ana County that will make homes healthier and more efficient, lower costs to make utility bills more affordable, and create more high-quality career opportunities that New Mexicans can build their families around.”\\xa0\\xa0 “I’m proud to join my colleagues to welcome these critical investments that will improve transportation infrastructure and create more opportunities for clean energy,”\\xa0said Luján. “This investment from the Department of Transportation will help identify how our local infrastructure in Doña Ana County can be strengthened to support emergency evacuations, including during natural disasters. In addition, I’m glad this separate investment from the Department of Energy will help lower costs for families by expanding access to clean, renewable energy through workforce education and training.”\\xa0 “As New Mexicans, we know all too well about the challenges climate change poses with the increased threat of wildfires, drought and extreme heat. I’m proud to secure this funding for Doña Ana County to address transportation vulnerabilities during emergencies and climate disasters,”\\xa0said Vasquez. “These investments will lay the groundwork to strengthen our infrastructure, lower costs and build a more resilient future.”\\xa0 “This grant award will be a tremendous boost for some of our residents, particularly those who live in Las Cruces’ older, more established neighborhoods.

       " 'Washington, D.C. - Congressman Bob Good (VA-05) introduced the Iran China Accountability Act to prevent the Biden Administration from entering into a disastrous nuclear agreement with Iran. The bill blocks any taxpayer dollars from being used to advance a nuclear agreement with Iran until Iran has terminated its cash ties with China and requires Iran to terminate its ties to terrorist groups like Hamas.  \"President Biden has effectively abandoned our most important friend and ally in the Middle East, Israel. From the very early days since Iran-backed Hamas terrorists brutally attacked, Biden has been pressuring Israel to surrender,” said Good. “Meanwhile, Biden has waived sanctions on Iran, releasing billions of dollars to the regime.”  The Iran China Accountability Act condemns Hamas-incited terrorist attacks and mandates a rigorous process for any potential nuclear agreement with Iran. Among its provisions, the bill:  Good continued, “Iran and China both seek America’s downfall. My legislation will hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable and ensure that Biden never re-enters the failed nuclear agreement with Iran.”  Co-sponsors: Rep. Mary Miller (IL- 15), Rep. Andy Ogles (TN-05), Rep. Barry Moore (AL-02), Rep. Clay Higgins (LA-03) Supporting Groups: Endowment for Middle East Truth (EMET), Zionist Organization of America (ZOA)  “The West, and most particularly the United States and Israel, are entering into a particularly perilous historic period with the merger of two of our greatest enemies, the Islamic Republic of Iran and China. Each of these nations harbor profound resentment and antipathy to all of the values our democracies represent, making this legislation critically important. Iran has already been the recipient of billions of dollars of US taxpayers’ funds through the JCPOA and has brutally massacred its own citizens who have courageously fought to overthrow their brutal theocracy. It has also created a network of terrorist proxies throughout the Middle East, as China has been attempting to purchase economic power throughout the region. This important bill must be passed, and any further agreement with Iran must go through the Constitutional protections of ratification of two-thirds of the US Senate.” –\\xa0Sarah Stern, Founder & President, Endowment for Middle East Truth (EMET)\\xa0\\xa0 \"Iran is the root cause of all the problems of the Middle East Region, and making any deal with Iran while they continue to support Islamist terrorist groups including Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis and calling for the destruction of America and Israel is an intolerable obscenity for the foreign policy interests of the United States as well as for our moral integrity. ZOA applauds Rep. Bob Good for his leadership in introducing this House bill that would prohibit the expenditure of any US taxpayer funds to advance a nuclear agreement with Iran while Iran is working with enemies of the U.S., including Arab terrorists responsible for the October 7th\\xa0atrocities and China, which has played an extremely hostile roll in the entire Middle East region.\\xa0 \"Any agreement with Iran can only be in effect once it is ratified as a treaty, which is a requirement of the U.S. Constitution. It is a step forward that this legislation requires Iran to end support for horrific terrorist groups, like Hamas. ZOA praises Rep.

       " 'Reps. Crawford and Duarte Introduce Legislation to Protect Water Systems from Cyber Threats 4/11/2024 Washington –\\xa0Citing persistent cyber threats to our nation’s critical water infrastructure, Congressmen Rick Crawford (AR-01) and John Duarte (CA-13) introduced H.R. 7922, the Water Risk and Resilience Organization (WRRO) Establishment Act. This legislation establishes a new governing body, the WRRO, with cyber and water-system expertise to develop and enforce cybersecurity requirements for drinking and wastewater systems. The WRRO will work in partnership with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to ensure cybersecurity measures are both practical and beneficial. “Foreign adversaries such as Russia and China have utilized cyber-attacks to target critical infrastructure such as water systems. This bill is a more proactive approach to safeguarding our drinking and wastewater from these types of attacks. These protections are vital at a time where cyber threats are constant and technology is evolving quickly,” Rep. Crawford said. Earlier this year, FBI Director, Christopher Wray testified to Congress that Chinese hackers have been targeting infrastructure such as water treatment plants, electrical grids, and pipelines. Just last month, other administration officials echoed this sentiment when both the national security advisor and EPA sent letters to state governors. In the letters, they urge the governors to address any vulnerabilities in their state’s water systems to minimize risks of cyber-attacks.\\xa0 This is more than just a threat; cybersecurity breaches have already happened around the country. Just before last Thanksgiving, a small Pennsylvania water utility was breached by pro-Iran hackers. A Florida water treatment facility was hacked in 2021, and the hackers tried to increase the amount of beneficial chemicals in the water to unsafe levels. In February, the U.S. intelligence community reported that Chinese-backed hackers have had a presence in many critical infrastructure systems in the U.S., including water systems for as long as maybe five years. “With the constant threat of cyberattacks by our adversaries,\\xa0the United States’ water infrastructure must be\\xa0secured and defended properly,” said Rep. Duarte. “I am proud to help lead this crucial legislation with Rep. Crawford to ensure that our wastewater and drinking water systems are adequately prepared to deal with potential cybersecurity threats.” Leaders in the water system industry have shown wide support for the Water Risk and Resilience Organization Establishment Act. They recognize the importance of safeguarding this critical resource and are willing to play a role in achieving this goal. “Strong and effective cybersecurity oversight is critical for the water sector,” said American Water Works Association CEO David LaFrance. “Rep. Crawford’s vision for a collaborative model that leverages the knowledge of the sector is the right approach for protecting water utilities from cyber-attacks.”\\xa0 “NAWC applauds the leadership of Rep. Crawford to advance legislation that helps bolster cybersecurity protections for the entire water sector. This legislation is long overdue and aligns with our guiding cybersecurity pillars, which call for greater collaboration and coordination of efforts to better protect critical water infrastructure,” said Rob Powelson, President and CEO of the National Association of Water Companies. “Cyber threats targeting both informational and operational systems today pose a growing threat to the nation’s water systems, and a successful cyber-attack could threaten public health while also undermining the public’s confidence in their water supply.\\xa0AMWA supports H.R. 7922 as a critical piece of the puzzle to defend the nation’s water systems from criminals and bad actors in cyberspace, and we thank Rep. Crawford for his leadership on this important\\xa0bill,” said Tom Dobbins, CEO of the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies.  Cyber-attacks often cost millions of dollars to address and can result in contamination, malfunctions, and service outages. Leveraging private sector expertise to provide cybersecurity awareness to thousands of public water systems across America is critical to ensuring infrastructure security.

Connolly (D-VA), Co-Chairs of the Congressional Taiwan Caucus, introduced a bipartisan resolution reaffirming the United States’ commitment to Taiwan and commemorating the 45th anniversary of the enactment of the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA). The resolution is cosponsored by a bipartisan group of 63 Members of Congress. Enacted on April 10, 1979, the TRA is an historic piece of legislation that embodies the United States’ commitment to make defense articles available for Taiwan’s self-defense capability and to maintain the capacity of the United States to resist any threat endangering the security of the people of Taiwan. Over the past four decades, the TRA has underpinned the robust United States-Taiwan relationship. Today, the enduring bond between the people of the United States and Taiwan serves as a beacon of democratic values, human rights, and the rule of law in the Indo-Pacific and across the world. \"For the past 45 years, the Taiwan Relations Act has been a cornerstone of peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region, embodying the strong and unwavering commitment of the United States to Taiwan,” said Congressman Andy Barr. “The United States is proud to have a deep and dynamic partnership with Taiwan, one that is based on mutual respect, shared democratic values, and a common commitment to freedom.” “The Taiwan Relations Act serves as the cornerstone of the U.S.-Taiwan relationship, fostering decades of fruitful economic, security, and trade ties,” said Congressman Ami Bera. “Taiwan’s engagement in international organizations to address shared challenges in public health, climate change, and democratic resilience exemplify its capabilities to be a force for good in the Indo-Pacific and across the globe. The United States remains steadfast in support of the people of Taiwan and our shared commitment to democratic values and the rule of law.” “I’m proud to co-sponsor this resolution commemorating the anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act which serves as the cornerstone of the U.S.-Taiwan relationship. The United States and Taiwan share core values in democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. Taiwan stands as a key ally, crucial to prosperity and stability in the region. The United States remains steadfast in its support of the people of Taiwan, and will continue to fortify this valued partnership for years to come,” said Congressman Mario Díaz-Balart. “Now more than ever, it is imperative that the United States stands shoulder to shoulder with Taiwan to celebrate our shared democratic values,” said Congressman Gerald E. Connolly. ?“What better way to reaffirm that solidarity than by recognizing the lasting importance of the Taiwan Relations Act, the foundation of our relationship. Today, we honor the friendship between the US and Taiwan and we recommit ourselves to preserving and protecting the critical partnership we share.” U.S. Senators\\xa0 Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Jeff Merkley (D-OR) introduced a companion resolution in the U.S. Senate.

       " \"Report – Servicing Scandals: Student Loan Servicers’ Failures During Return to Repayment Today, U.S. Senators Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), and Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) released a new report: Servicing Scandals: Student Loan Servicers’ Failures During Return to Repayment, which reveals a decades-long pattern of student loan servicer incompetence and misconduct that has affected millions of borrowers nationwide. The report examines servicer failures during the return to repayment and how these countless billing errors and customer service problems harmed borrowers. The report comes as the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee’s Subcommittee on Economic Policy holds a hearing today on MOHELA’s performance as a student loan servicer. The report includes new information about loan servicers' performance during the return to repayment provided by the Department of Education and from loan servicers' responses to Congressional inquiries.\\xa0 This data indicated that, in total, servicers made more than 3.9 million billing-related errors during the return to repayment. “Millions of Americans struggle under the weight of student debt, hindering their opportunities and holding back our entire economy. And as this report shows, systemic incompetence and mismanagement across the student loan servicing industry spanning many years – as well as the millions of billing errors that have occurred since the return to repayment after the pandemic pause – have only made things harder for these Americans. The Biden Administration has made critical improvements through their new industry accountability measures, but we must do more to help those who have been impacted by servicers’ failures and to ensure that their actions don’t hinder the Administration’s work to provide relief to millions of borrowers,” said Senator Van Hollen. “It’s clear that all servicers misled borrowers and screwed up the resumption of student loan repayments, making a whopping 3.9 million errors,” said Senator Warren. “For decades, loan servicers misled and harmed borrowers who have done everything right. It’s time for real action and accountability.”\\xa0 “The findings of this report paint a harrowing picture, and borrowers deserve justice—these servicers must remedy these harms and resolve this nightmare for borrowers. Student loan debt in the United States is more than $1.6 trillion dollars, impacting over 42 million Americans. For too long, student loan servicers have harmed borrowers with deceitful tactics, including incorrect and late billing statements, low quality customer service, slow processing times, and an overall lack of transparency,” said Senator Blumenthal. “Rampant student loan servicing errors have left millions of borrowers confused about how much they owe and when. These student loan servicers are further proving to the American people the absurdity of saddling students who are working to achieve their educational dreams with expensive and burdensome loans. We must work towards a world where students don’t have to worry about taking on any debt at all. In the meantime, the Biden administration needs to take steps to ameliorate the harm that these servicers have inflicted on borrowers,” said Senator Markey.\\xa0 The report found that every single student loan servicer—EdFinancial, Maximus, MOHELA, and Nelnet—failed to adequately prepare for the transition back to repayment despite numerous warnings and federal funds throughout the payment pause. As a result, millions of borrowers experienced billing-related errors and poor customer service, made unnecessary payments, and were denied debt relief due to servicing mistakes.\\xa0 The report calls for a clear path to cancel debt for borrowers who are harmed by servicer failures as the Department of Education works through the rulemaking process for student debt cancellation under the Higher Education Act.\\xa0 Key findings from the report include:\\xa0\",\n",
       " 'U.S. Senators Chris Van Hollen and Ben Cardin, joined with Congressmen Kweisi Mfume, Andy Harris, Steny Hoyer, Dutch Ruppersberger, John Sarbanes, Jamie Raskin, David Trone and Glenn Ivey\\xa0on Thursday to introduce bicameral, bipartisan legislation that would allow the federal government to fully fund the replacement of the Francis Scott Key Bridge and its approaches.\\xa0Governor Wes Moore, who joined the full Maryland delegation at the Capitol earlier this week for a meeting with Biden-Harris administration officials, praised the bill for fulfilling President Joe Biden’s commitment to have the federal government fully support rebuilding the bridge after the March 26 fatal collapse. Introduced Thursday in both the Senate and the House,\\xa0S. 4114, the\\xa0“Baltimore Bridge Response Invests and Delivers Global Economic Relief Act,” or\\xa0“Baltimore BRIDGE Relief Act,” would amend the federal cost-share requirement for Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Emergency Relief Program for Disaster-Damaged Highways and Bridges. Funds are available for responding to damage caused by the cargo ship Dali to the Francis Scott Key Bridge. The\\xa0Baltimore BRIDGE Relief Act\\xa0would ensure the federal government supports 100 percent of the replacement of this critical bridge and its approaches in Baltimore City, Baltimore County and Anne Arundel County. Emergency Relief funding automatically has a 100 percent federal cost share for the first 270 days after the disaster. Maryland already has received $60 million in Emergency Relief funds. “The impact of the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge has been felt deeply – across Baltimore, our state, and our nation. But during times of tragedy, we come together. As we continue to mourn the lives lost in Baltimore, we are committed to doing everything we can to support our City, our state, and our workers. That’s why federal Team Maryland is putting forward this bipartisan legislation to ensure the federal government covers the full cost of rebuilding the bridge as safely and quickly as possible – and that federal taxpayers benefit from any monies recovered from those found responsible. As we have in the wake of disaster many times before, it’s time to put politics aside and get this done,”\\xa0said Senator Van Hollen. “The sudden collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge was a human tragedy and an economic tragedy – for Maryland and the nation. As\\xa0we continue to mourn the loss of life and this icon of our skyline, we can simultaneously begin work to heal the wounds created by this disaster. A new bridge can be a symbol of hope and resilience,”\\xa0said Senator Cardin. “The federal government is an essential partner in this gargantuan task of reopening the Port of Baltimore shipping channel and replacing the bridge with one built for modern-day commerce and travel needs.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 “When the Key Bridge collapsed, it didn’t just affect Maryland – it affected the entire country. We must continue to come together, across party lines and all levels of government, to reopen the Port of Baltimore and rebuild the bridge as fast as possible,”\\xa0said Governor Moore. “I’m grateful for the leadership of our congressional delegation and our federal allies in this hour of national importance. We can – and we will – win this moment, together.” “Since the collapse of Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge, the Maryland Congressional Delegation has acted with unity, collectedness, precision, and promise. Today, we have made good on our commitment to America and our State by introducing companion legislation in both the House and Senate to build back the Bridge and build it better. A disaster of this scale requires nothing less than the full and total cooperation of all parties involved,”\\xa0said Congressman Mfume. “Following the sudden collapse of the Francis Scott Key bridge, my message has been clear—we must focus our efforts on recovering the victims, bringing closure to those who lost loved ones, and ensuring that the American taxpayer is not held responsible for costs that any negligent, foreign owned shipping company should pay,”\\xa0said Congressman Harris.\\xa0“This legislation is a step in the right direction and will provide Maryland with the resources necessary to reopen the channel, rebuild the bridge, and hold any party responsible for reimbursing the federal government if found negligent.” “Reopening the Port of Baltimore and rebuilding the Francis Scott Key Bridge as fast as possible is in the interest of every American.”\\xa0Congressman Hoyer said. “That’s why it is crucial that we pass this legislation to authorize the federal government to cover the full cost of this project, in accordance with the commitment that the Biden-Harris Administration made immediately after the collapse. This bill is an essential first step in the rebuilding process. To vote against this legislation is to vote against the success of the American economy and the American people.” “Rebuilding the Key Bridge – quickly, safely and stronger – is essential to restoring jobs, protecting the supply chain and keeping inflation down. It’s also necessary to ensure no other families will ever have to endure the heartache of those of the six workers who died performing a community service and who deserve our respect and gratitude,”\\xa0said Congressman Ruppersberger. “We call on all of our colleagues to come together to support this legislation to help bring the Port of Baltimore back online and working for the American economy.” “Since the sudden and tragic collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge, Team Maryland has been united in our commitment to supporting the families of victims, rebuilding the bridge and resuming full Port of Baltimore operations,”\\xa0said Congressman Sarbanes. “The introduction of this bipartisan legislation is proof of our determination to ensure every federal resource at our disposal is deployed to recover from this tragedy. We will keep working in lockstep with President Biden, Governor Moore and other key partners until this vital thoroughfare and iconic symbol of the Baltimore skyline is rebuilt.” “While we continue to mourn and recover from this tragedy, I strongly urge my Congressional colleagues to rise to the challenges ahead and help fund this effort because this isn’t a Maryland problem, it’s an American one. This legislation delivers the message that this critical infrastructure deserves our full support,”\\xa0said Congressman Trone.\\xa0“As a Member of Congress, but most importantly, as a Marylander, I’m prepared to do whatever it takes to provide Baltimore and our state the resources we need to recover, rebuild, and move forward – together.” “Tragic disasters like the destruction of the Key Bridge in Baltimore should not be a blue concern or a red concern but an American concern. Compassion and forethought must be the watchwords of the current situation. We mourn the loss of life and abhor the loss of economic liberty which the bridge collapse has wrought on Marylanders and our fellow Americans. As a federal partner, the Congress must come together to fund the reopening of the Port of Baltimore, and ultimately the rebuilding of a new bridge to help not only Maryland’s economy but also the entire country’s supply chain,”\\xa0said Congressman Ivey. The\\xa0Baltimore BRIDGE Relief Act\\xa0reiterates current law that requires any funds recovered from applicable insurance or liable parties will reimburse the taxpayers for the cost of replacing the Francis Scott Key Bridge. There has been ample precedent for the federal government taking on 100 percent of the recovery costs after a major disaster, ranging from the Northridge earthquake in Southern California, the I-35W bridge collapse in Minnesota, and numerous major hurricanes nationwide.

Hoyer, Dutch Ruppersberger, John Sarbanes, Andy Harris, M.D., Jamie Raskin, David Trone and Glenn Ivey (all Md.) today announced $3.5 million in U.S. Department of Labor’s emergency National Dislocated Worker Grant funds to create temporary clean up and recovery jobs for workers impacted by the tragic collapse of Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge. “The collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge was a human tragedy. We will never forget the six Marylanders we lost in this tragedy, and we’re holding their memories and their families close to our hearts throughout each step of this process,” said the lawmakers. “The collapse also caused serious consequences for our state’s economy, but the reality is that the whole country depends on the Port of Baltimore so the impact is felt far and wide. This tragedy took\\xa0reliable revenue and income from\\xa0small businesses\\xa0and hundreds of thousands of workers. With\\xa0this funding, we hope to relieve some of the economic burden\\xa0and provide stability in a time of uncertainty and grief as teams work to restore the Port as swiftly and safely as possible.”\\xa0 In the early hours of March 26, 2024, a 985-foot cargo ship struck the Francis Scott Key Bridge’s support pylons after losing power. The impact caused the bridge to collapse, tragically killing\\xa0six hardworking Marylanders, halting\\xa0many\\xa0Port of Baltimore operations, and creating a massive, complex wreckage site underwater. Each year, the Port of Baltimore\\xa0generates $70 billion dollars in revenue for the state’s economy and billions of dollars of revenue for the global economy. While modified channels have opened since the collapse and an auxiliary channel is anticipated to open at the end of the month to restart some Port traffic, it is necessary to provide immediate relief to the 8000 Marylanders currently out of work. The Dislocated Worker Grant Program was created to expand the service capacity of dislocated worker programs at the state and local levels by providing funding assistance in response to large, unexpected economic events that lead to significant job losses.',\n",

If approved, Kitka would replace Jocelyn Fenton who started serving in the role of Interim Federal Co-Chair on March 6, 2024. “Alaskans know what Julie Kitka can deliver when she’s taking the lead,” said Senator Lisa Murkowski. “For 33 years, she served as the President of the Alaska Federation of Natives, successfully balancing the needs of a diverse group of tribes, village corporations, regional corporations, regional nonprofits and tribal consortiums, while advocating for Alaskan Natives on a local, state, and federal level. There is no one I can think who is more qualified to advocate for economic development in rural Alaska than Julie.” “Julie Kitka has been a generational leader advancing the interests and improving the lives of Alaska Native people,” said Senator Dan Sullivan. “During her historic, 33-year tenure as President of the Alaska Federation of Natives, Julie elevated the voices of Alaska Native communities and tribes to the highest levels of our state and federal governments, and accomplished so much on behalf of tens of thousands of Alaskans. She also had an unwavering focus on connecting AFN to our Alaska-based military and veterans community that was another very impressive aspect of her tenure. Julie’s wealth of leadership experience and vast knowledge of rural Alaska uniquely qualify her to lead the Denali Commission and execute its important mission. I look forward to continuing to work with Julie in this new role to create opportunities for economic and infrastructure development in our rural communities.” “Julie Kitka is a force of nature. Her work at the forefront of Alaska Native politics has inspired and motivated many across the state. I’ve known Julie for many years, and she has always spoken out for the issues Native and rural Alaskans face. As an organization dedicated to serving the needs of rural Alaskans, the Denali Commission needs a leader like Julie,” said Rep. Peltola. “I’m proud of the delegation’s selection, and I’m hopeful that we will see her approved and at work as soon as possible.” Background:\\xa0The Denali Commission was established in 1998 by the late Senator Ted Stevens to fund economic development and infrastructure in rural Alaska.

It’s my honor to receive this award from an organization so dedicated to preserving our nation’s natural wonders.” “It is our privilege to bestow the Centennial Leadership Award to the senior senator from Michigan, Debbie Stabenow. Since Michiganders first sent Senator Stabenow to Congress in 1997, she has proven herself to be a stalwart champion for America’s Great Lakes and the ten national parks at the heart of the Great Lakes region. Senator Stabenow has led the fight to protect freshwater, resulting in billions of dollars invested in restoring and protecting our majestic Great Lakes,” said Theresa Pierno, President and CEO for the National Parks Conservation Association. “Senator Stabenow’s decisive action and leadership on climate, our national heritage areas, and other key national park issues has been inspiring. She is living proof that courageous public service can bring about real change, and she is an example for future leaders to follow. I know I speak for national park advocates across the country in thanking her for the mountains she has moved,” Pierno continued. Senator Stabenow has been a leader in restoring and protecting the Great Lakes and public lands – which face growing threats as a result of the climate crisis. Senator Stabenow authored two landmark programs that will help ensure the lasting health of our Great Lakes and waterways for future generations – the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative and the Regional Conservation Partnership Program. She also helped pass the historic Great American Outdoors Act, which guaranteed much-needed funding for public lands maintenance and renovation projects in Michigan and across the country.  To protect National Heritage Areas, Senator Stabenow authored the National Heritage Area Act and shepherded it through Congress. Signed into law in 2023, the National Heritage Area Act reauthorized the MotorCities National Heritage Area in Detroit as well as 44 other National Heritage Areas that were set to expire by 2024 for another 15 years, ensuring long-term security for these sites and the communities they benefit. The bill also set up a much-needed framework for the designation and management of new and existing National Heritage Areas. Since 1919, the nonpartisan National Parks Conservation Association\\xa0(NPCA) has been the leading voice in safeguarding our national parks. NPCA and its more than 1.6 million members and supporters work together to protect and preserve our nation’s most iconic and inspirational places for future generations. ###',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON – Senator John Hoeven issued the following statement after the U.S. Senate passed a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), sponsored by Senator Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), to overturn costly, overreaching emissions mandates on state departments of transportation (DOTs). Last year, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) reinstated an Obama-era rule requiring state DOTs to set and enforce declining targets for CO2\\xa0emissions from vehicle traffic, which would significantly burden state-level investments in roadways, bridges, highways and other transportation projects. Hoeven and his colleagues previously\\xa0called on the FHWA\\xa0to rescind the proposed rule, stressing that the agency does not have the required authority from Congress to impose such a mandate. “Burdensome mandates like this FHWA rule disproportionately harm large rural states like North Dakota and will inflate the costs of needed repairs and updates to roadways, bridges and other transportation systems, meaning taxpayers get less for more,” said Hoeven. “Time and again, the Biden administration has overreached its authority and undermined the U.S. economy with expansive federal rules. This CRA resolution is part of our broader efforts to provide regulatory relief, remove these burdens and hold the administration accountable.” -###-',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON – Senator John Hoeven issued the following statement after the U.S. Senate passed the House companion to a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) that he introduced with Senator Bill Cassidy (R-La.) to overturn the National Labor Relations Board’s (NLRB) joint employer rule, which forces liability on companies for another business’ employees even if they do not directly oversee them.\\xa0\\xa0 Specifically, the rule imposes on franchisers the liability of individual franchise owners, despite having no operational authority over the businesses’ employees. This undermines the viability of the franchise business model, a system that employs over eight million workers and has empowered Americans from all communities to become successful business owners. Additionally, the rule creates uncertainty among small and local businesses on their legal liabilities, leading to higher operational costs and less opportunity to create jobs.\\xa0 “The NLRB’s joint employer rule creates legal uncertainty, hurting a successful business model while needlessly imposing costs on business owners. Our CRA resolution would restore long-standing legal standards and alleviate the burdens of this new rule, allowing business owners to hire more employees and expand their operations instead of spending those dollars on regulatory compliance and resulting litigation,” said Hoeven. For over 25 years, it was an established legal precedent that a company could only be considered a joint employer if they have “direct and immediate” management over another business’ employees. This\\xa0changed\\xa0in 2015 under the Obama administration, who forced companies to be liable for another business’ employees if they held “indirect” and “reserved” control over their workers.

The rule would impose new fees and increase existing bonding requirements, royalty rates and minimum bids, while restricting the lands available for leasing. This will discourage investment in new domestic energy production, increase our reliance on foreign imports and result in higher energy prices for U.S. consumers. “This rule continues the Biden administration’s regulatory onslaught that is handcuffing our domestic energy producers, driving up energy costs and making our nation less safe,” said Hoeven. “In states like North Dakota with split-estate lands, the federal government controls significant surface acreage and mineral rights and this rule will limit the development of our abundant, taxpayer-owned oil and gas resources, increasing costs for producers and consumers. We’ll work to stop this rule and force President Biden to reverse course on his regulatory agenda so that we can take the handcuffs off our domestic energy producers.” Hoeven helped introduce the Spur Permitting of Underdeveloped Resources (SPUR) Act, legislation sponsored by ENR Committee Ranking Member John Barrasso, which includes provisions to overturn the Biden administration’s fee increases on the development of federal energy resources. -###-',\n",

Vance (R-Ohio). Full text of the letter can be found below: Dear President Biden: We write to request that you again take swift executive action to permit the sale of E15 fuel during the 2024 summer driving season by extending the Reid vapor pressure (RVP) waiver, nationwide, from June 1 through September 15. Enabling the year-round sale of E15, as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) permitted in both 2022 and 2023 through nationwide temporary waivers under Clean Air Act Section 211(c)(4)(C)(ii), helped allow our energy supply chain to “address extreme and unusual fuel supply circumstances caused by the war in Ukraine that are affecting all regions of the nation.” Unfortunately, this underlying justification remains applicable as Russia’s war of aggression continues to weigh on global energy and security. Further, Iran-backed aggression in the Middle East, specifically Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, presents new threats to global energy markets and our energy security. To counter these influences, we must pursue an all-of-the-above energy strategy, which includes leveraging domestic biofuels. As your previous temporary waivers have proven, permitting the sale of higher blends of biofuels like E15 through the summer driving season bolsters the domestic fuel supply, lowers consumer costs, and promotes the environmental benefits of American biofuels and modern agriculture. Furthermore, temporary action is again required in light of the EPA’s announcement to postpone until 2025 the implementation of eight state petitions to sell E15 year-round. As you know, the consideration of state action has led to a historic agreement between liquid fuel stakeholders in support of securing a permanent legislative solution to allow nationwide, year-round E15 sales, while respecting each state’s authority to opt-out of such a program. Taking temporary action now will continue the uninterrupted sale of E15 for what would be the sixth consecutive year, a major win for consumer choice and emissions reductions. Lastly, extending the nationwide sale of E15 could again add billions of gallons of ethanol to the fuel supply at a time domestic inventories of crude oil and petroleum products are at their lowest point since May 2004, below when the EPA issued its 2022 and 2023 waivers. Furthermore, additional decreases in OPEC oil production will only amplify the already robust market for U.S. exports at a time of rising fuel demand. American biofuels remain a straightforward, no-cost solution to shoring up our energy supply and reducing consumer costs, and issuing a waiver for the 2024 summer driving season remains in the public’s best interest. Thank you for your swift consideration of this request. -###-',\n",

I'm from San Diego, and you don't think of floods… and we just had a gigantic flood in San Diego, a 1,000-year event. And it flooded a good portion of San Diego, we had all these problems, something we normally don't get,” said Rep. Vargas. “This stuff is real. Investors know it, companies know it, the information is there, they should disclose it. And that's what this rule attempts to do.” Last year, Reps. Vargas and Sean Casten (IL-06) founded the Congressional Sustainable Investment Caucus to create a forum to protect Americans’ freedom to invest while increasing the information available to market participants about the risks posed by climate change. Rep. Vargas’s Corporate Governance Improvement and Investor Protection Act, which passed the House in the 117th Congress, encouraged corporations to address important issues such as climate change and worker rights by requiring the SEC to create standard definitions for environmental and social responsibility metrics. The bill also included language from Rep. Casten’s Climate Risk Disclosure Act that required public companies to disclose additional information about their exposure to climate-related risks.\\xa0 A rough transcript of an excerpt from Rep. Vargas’s remarks and questions for witness Professor Jill E. Fisch, University of Pennsylvania Law School Saul A. Fox Distinguished Professor of Business Law, is available below.\\xa0 Rep. Vargas:\\xa0 In your view, how was the rule consistent with the SEC’s three-part mission to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation? Professor Fisch:\\xa0 Thank you. So as my written testimony details, this is information that investors have been demanding, this is a small tip of the information that investors have been demanding with respect to business risks, sustainability challenges for companies, and it responds to the long-standing information asymmetry. Companies have this information, investors don't.\\xa0 And that information asymmetry, reducing that information asymmetry, is what produces more efficient markets so that investors can choose the companies in which they want to invest, so they can evaluate whether a business plan is resilient for the future, and so they can evaluate the quality of management.\\xa0 And something we haven't really focused on today is investors do that not just by buying and selling securities, they also do that through exercising their governance rights. And part of the SEC's mandate is to provide meaningful disclosure so that investors can vote, so that they can vote to elect directors who are monitoring material risks, so that they can vote for or against shareholder proposals based on how well they think the company is doing. And how does that facilitate capital formation? Well, obviously, if you've got strong quality markets, that's going to make it easier for companies to raise capital. And that's going to tailor the costs of capital to a company's business plan. And we see that in the fact that so many companies come to the U.S. capital markets to raise capital. Rep. Vargas:\\xa0 Now, I do want to say this, you talked about the corporations, a lot of these corporations do in fact, collect this information, as you said, because they think it's real… The reality is that they do compile this information because it’s important.\\xa0 And climate change is happening no matter what people think. I mean, I'm from San Diego, and you don't think of floods and San Diego, we just had a gigantic flood in San Diego, a 1,000-year event. And it flooded a good portion of San Diego, and we had all these problems, something we normally don't get.

       " 'Washington, D.C. (Apr. 12, 2024) — Congresswoman Cori Bush (MO-01) released the below statement following the House passage of H.R. 7888, the Reforming Intelligence and Securing America Act. This bill reauthorizes Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) despite failing to impose a warrant requirement when the government wants to spy on U.S. citizens, and despite its inclusion of amendments dramatically expanding unnecessary surveillance of immigrants and the types of businesses that the government could compel to turn over electronic communications. “Our government has a long and dark history of illegally surveilling U.S. citizens. Black and brown communities, as well as anti-war and other social movements, have borne the brunt of this injustice, enduring disproportionate targeting—from COINTELPRO to the protests ignited by the murder of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, and now, the protests against Cop City in Atlanta. I voted no to reauthorize FISA Section 702 because I refuse to sanction this shameful expansion of unrestricted, warrantless government surveillance. I will continue to be a relentless champion for safety and privacy for all people in St. Louis and across our country.” ###',\n",

       " 'Washington, D.C. – Today, Rep. Mike Levin (CA-49) sent a letter to House Energy and Commerce (E&C) Energy, Climate, and Grid Security Subcommittee Chairman Jeff Duncan (SC-03) and Ranking Member Diana DeGette (CO-01) regarding the Subcommittee’s hearing today on spent nuclear fuel. The letter details potential solutions for the approximately 90,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel stranded at nuclear power plants across the country, harming host communities and costing taxpayers billions of dollars. The letter goes on to highlight the shortcomings of the current system for storing spent nuclear fuel, including the impact it has on the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station in Rep. Levin’s district. Accordingly, the letter shares Rep. Levin’s perspective on the necessity of a consent-based approach to break the stalemate over storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel. Critically, the letter explains specific consent-based actions that Congress and the federal government must take to address our current spent nuclear fuel challenges. The Subcommittee invited Daniel Stetson, the Chairman of the San Onofre Community Engagement Panel, to share his expertise through testimony at the hearing. “It is clear to me, and I hope to you as well, that Congress must act.” writes Rep. Levin. “We have seen how a lack of consent has historically stopped projects – both public and private…. While it is encouraging that for the first time in more than a decade the government is finally progressing towards fulfilling its obligation to take title to this waste, we still have a long way to go towards a comprehensive, integrated waste management system.” Click here or read the full letter below: Dear Chairman Duncan and Ranking Member DeGette, As the Energy, Climate, and Grid Security Subcommittee conducts its hearing titled “American Nuclear Energy Expansion: Spent Fuel Policy and Innovation,” I write on behalf of my constituents in California’s 49th Congressional District to share our perspectives on spent nuclear fuel issues. I first wish to express my appreciation for the Subcommittee’s attention to such a long-standing issue that impacts Congressional districts across the country, including the one that I represent and call home. I am also grateful for the Subcommittee’s invitation to Daniel Stetson, the Chairman of the San Onofre Community Engagement Panel, to share more about the impact that the current system of spent fuel management has on our community. Since the 1950s, approximately 90,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel have been generated from commercial nuclear power generation in the United States, and this inventory grows by approximately 2,000 metric tons every single year. In 1982, Congress passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, which mandated that the U.S. government take possession of spent nuclear\\xa0fuel and assigned the Department of Energy (DOE) the responsibility to manage spent nuclear fuel from commercial reactors. Then in 1987, Congress decided to designate Yucca Mountain as the sole candidate for a permanent geologic repository, without engaging in a consent-based process, and over Nevadans’ objections. More recent private storage efforts in New Mexico and Texas have not advanced due to a similar lack of consent. As a result, the 90,000 metric tons of existing spent nuclear fuel is being stored indefinitely at over 70 sites in more than 30 states, without the consent of the communities in which they are located. To say that this current situation is not ideal would be an understatement. Because the federal government was unable to fulfill its responsibility to begin disposing of spent nuclear fuel beginning in January 1998, the federal government has been found to be in partial breach of its contract with owners of commercial nuclear power reactors and must use taxpayer dollars to pay for damages of this breach. The latest Nuclear Waste Fund Audit Report by the DOE Inspector General (DOE-OIG-24-02) notes that this partial breach has cost taxpayers $10.6 billion through September 30, 2023, and that the remaining additional liabilities will total $34.1 billion. These funds add to the federal deficit without benefit of budget or appropriations considerations. This breach also leaves communities like my own to serve as de facto interim storage sites, without their consent. The decommissioning San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS) in my district currently stores more than 3.5 million pounds of spent nuclear fuel just 100 feet from the Pacific Ocean, near active fault lines, surrounded by highly populated areas and on Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton. Since I took office in 2019, one of my top priorities has been moving the spent nuclear fuel from SONGS as quickly and safely as possible. Part of this work has included working with colleagues to secure funding\\xa0for DOE to restart a federal, consent-based consolidated interim storage program. In April 2023, DOE released its comprehensive outline for a 10- to 15-year plan to successfully site and store spent fuel using a consent-based siting process. This process is designed to work with local governments that want to host a site in a way that is inclusive, community-driven, phased, and adaptive. We have seen how a lack of consent has historically stopped projects – both public and private – so I am optimistic that this new, consent-based approach can break the current stalemate on the development of federal management capacity for spent nuclear fuel. While it is encouraging that for the first time in more than a decade the government is finally progressing towards fulfilling its obligation to take title to this waste, we still have a long way to go towards a comprehensive, integrated waste management system. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has found that “a variety of actions are needed to move ahead, including authorization of a new effort to determine where a disposal facility should be located and the development of a management strategy,” and that “Congress needs to take action to break the impasse over a permanent solution for commercial spent nuclear fuel.” While we do not yet know the ultimate sites for consolidated interim storage and a permanent repository, we do know the consent-based path that we must take to successfully site these facilities. We also have the benefit of years of thought and expert development of a bipartisan path forward for how we successfully manage our nuclear future. And, we can now look to the examples set by other countries, such as Finland, Sweden, and Canada, and how their work prioritized consent and was led by single purpose organizations. It is clear to me, and I hope to you as well, that Congress must act. Particularly at a time when we are considering promoting further nuclear energy development, we must also consider the technology’s full life span, including its long-term impact and environmental risks. Anything short of addressing the spent fuel problem is irresponsible and could result in a future, preventable crisis. In the immediate term, we must continue to provide funding, on a bipartisan basis, to DOE’s integrated waste management work, and ensure that annual funding is commensurate with the Department’s needs throughout the process. We must also provide DOE with clear direction to develop a total system plan for the management of spent nuclear fuel, and to build capacity and execute upon this plan. We must also amend existing law to grant the federal government the authority to site, construct and operate a consolidated interim storage site and ultimately a new geological repository, and direct that these processes be based in consent, as agreed upon by the host communities themselves. We must also work with potential host communities and states to identify benefits they can receive in exchange for their volunteering to store this waste. Further, we ought to ensure that we make progress on siting a repository in tandem with a consolidated interim storage facility, so as to provide interim storage host communities with the assurance that they will not become permanent storage sites by default. We may even consider creating a new single-purpose, autonomous organization insulated from the political process and with access to reliable and adequate funding, to handle these tasks. Communities across the country, including my own, have waited patiently for action on this matter. It is past time that we end the continued stalemate that is wasteful of taxpayer resources. The path ahead will not be easy and will require many difficult conversations. But I am committed to seeing this through, and I hope to work with you and your staff to finally fulfill the federal government’s responsibility to manage spent nuclear fuel. Sincerely, Mike Levin United States Representative ###',\n",
       " 'Washington, D.C. — Today, the Co-Chairs of the House Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition (SEEC) Clean Energy Deployment Task Force, Reps. Mike Levin (CA-49) and Sean Casten (IL-06), released the following statement in response to the finalization of the Renewable Energy Rule from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), which will spur the responsible development of clean energy on America’s public lands.\\xa0 “Today, the Biden-Harris Administration announced a historic milestone in ensuring we are maximizing the ability of our public lands to fight the climate crisis,” said Reps. Levin and Casten. “We are pleased to see that we have already surpassed the goal of permitting 25 GW of renewable energy on our public lands by 2025. Now we must build on this progress and continue to aim higher. That’s why our bill, the Clean Electricity and Transmission Acceleration (CETA) Act, sets the next goal of permitting 60 GW by 2030, while also further promoting the buildout of renewable energy on public lands in a responsible, equitable, and efficient manner. “Responsible and planned development of renewables on public lands provides certainty to developers, setting the stage for successful projects while ensuring our most treasured resources are protected. We applaud the now operational projects in California, which prove this planned approach works. But we know more permitting reforms are needed to allow for more efficient development in priority areas without sacrificing environmental protections. We must also ensure that state and local communities benefit from projects in their jurisdiction. Today’s announcement strengthens our resolve to get the necessary reforms in our bill enacted into law.” Background Reps. Levin and Casten introduced the Clean Electricity and Transmission Acceleration (CETA) Act in December 2023 to serve as a consensus House Democrat vision to address the primary permitting and transmission issues holding back the American clean energy transition. The bill is endorsed by the House Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition, the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and the New Democrat Coalition. Reps. Levin and Casten co-lead the bill with 79 of their House Democratic colleagues as cosponsors. Of particular relevance to BLM’s final rule, Title IV of CETA incorporates Rep. Levin’s Public Land Renewable Energy Deployment Act (H.R. 178). This title directs the Department of Interior to permit at least 60 gigawatts of renewable energy on public lands by 2030 and responsibly incentivizes this development on priority areas, while minimizing the adverse impacts to communities and the environment. This title also directs revenues to state and local governments-- providing parity with oil and gas development-- and to fund conservation and mitigation efforts. BLM’s announcement implements authorities that Rep. Levin has championed through the Public Land Renewable Energy Development Act and helped secure in the Energy Act of 2020.

       " 'Washington, D.C.- Rep. Mike Levin (D-Calif) joined House Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member Raúl M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.), Water, Wildlife, and Fisheries Subcommittee Ranking Member Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.), and Rep. Susie Lee (D-Nev.) to issue the following statements applauding the Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM) final rule for onshore oil and gas leasing on public lands. The rule reflects long overdue fiscal reforms that were passed in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), including increased onshore royalty rates, minimum bid amounts, and rental rates; a new fee to nominate public lands for leasing; and an end to noncompetitive leasing. The rule also strengthens bonding requirements for the first time since 1960. “I applaud the Biden Administration for issuing this final rule to promote conservation and ensure a fair financial return on the profits fossil fuel companies make off our public lands,” said Rep. Levin. “The rule ends giveaways of our public lands to fossil fuel companies, holds companies accountable for cleanup costs, and updates outdated fiscal terms for onshore oil and gas leases, all while protecting our important environmental and cultural resources. Taxpayers should never foot the bill for cleaning up after Big Oil. I’m proud to see provisions of legislation I introduced included in this rule to elevate the interests of the American people over fossil fuel companies’ profits.” “When Big Oil uses our public lands, it stands to reason that they should be giving American taxpayers a fair return for the privilege,” said Ranking Member Grijalva. “That’s why Democrats worked so hard to pass reforms in the Inflation Reduction Act to return some balance to a leasing system that has favored polluters for far too long. The Biden administration is taking an important step in moving those reforms forward with this new rule. The ultimate goal is phasing out fossil fuels for good, but these new taxpayer protections will help make sure the American people aren’t getting ripped off in the meantime.” “Democrats fought long and hard to pass reforms in the Inflation Reduction Act to stop Big Oil from abusing our public lands at the cost of our communities and our climate, and this finalized rule by the Biden-Harris administration is going to ensure those reforms are implemented,” said Rep. Huffman. “This is a huge step in putting people over polluters instead of letting fossil fuel and mining industries pad their pockets and plunder our public lands with impunity.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 “For over a century, Big Oil has paid pennies on the acre to drill on our public lands—and then left taxpayers on the hook to clean up the mess,” said Rep. Katie Porter. “In Congress, I’ve fought to get rid of Big Oil’s sweetheart deal to pollute our public lands. I’m proud my proposals to end this reckless disregard for the environment—and our taxpayer dollars—are now law, and I applaud the Biden Administration for putting these much-needed reforms into action.”  “I represent working families in southern Nevada – not Big Oil & Gas. Public lands belong in public hands, not tied up in costly and unproductive fossil fuel speculation,” said Rep. Susie Lee. “Over 80 percent of Nevada lands are public lands, and I’ve made it a top priority to protect our resources and taxpayers from the outdated and wasteful approach of our speculative leasing system. Today’s announcement is another major step toward fixing the broken elements of this system, in line with my End Speculative Oil and Gas Leasing Act. I will continue to work toward a diverse, clean, and efficient energy economy that unleashes our state’s energy potential while lowering costs and protecting our public lands.”  Background The rule reflects legislation championed by Natural Resources Committee Democrats, including the following: 117th Congress: 118th Congress: ###',\n",

San Diego County and the Catholic Diocese of San Diego County each received $19,592,554 in SSP funding to assist with migrant arrivals. “All migrants deserve to be treated humanely, and San Diego is striving to be the model for communities receiving migrants across the country. I’m proud that my colleagues and I in the San Diego delegation secured this critical funding, which will help ensure migrants are welcomed with dignity and respect,” said Rep. Levin. “This funding will help our local partners provide additional resources to meet migrants’ basic human needs and reduce the impact on the existing safety net, including on homeless shelters. While I welcome this announcement, I also know we have more work to do. Congress must pass the bipartisan border security agreement, which would in part provide additional SSP funds.” “People who seek asylum and refuge in the U.S. should be treated with respect and dignity. This funding will allow San Diego nonprofits to continue to provide desperately needed humanitarian aid to individuals and families as they await an immigration court hearing or transportation to another part of the country. I thank the Biden administration and urge Congress to pass the bipartisan border security agreement, which would provide an additional $1.4 billion in SSP funds, speed up the judicial process, and give resources to Customs and Border Protection to better manage the border,” said Rep. Scott Peters (CA-50). “The Shelter and Services Program (SSP) is one of our best tools to ensure that our country is living up to our values and treating migrants and asylum seekers with dignity and respect. That’s why I’m so proud that our San Diego congressional delegation secured another $640 million in federal funds for this program, guaranteeing millions of dollars for San Diego. As always, we will keep pushing for comprehensive immigration reform to address the root causes of migration, relieve the strain on our asylum processing system, and expand the legal pathways for people to stay and work in the U.S., but this funding will go a long way to addressing our immediate concerns regarding the housing, safety, and needs of migrants and asylum seekers in San Diego,” said Rep. Sara Jacobs (CA-51). “The San Diego area has a long tradition of welcoming individuals seeking asylum and refuge with open arms. I’m proud to have worked alongside my San Diego delegation colleagues to secure this critical funding for communities and organizations aiding migrants,” said Rep.

The congressmen both represent the city of San Antonio, Texas, which has maintained a sister city relationship with Kumamoto, Japan for nearly four decades.  “Prime Minister Kishida’s visit to Washington has been a wonderful opportunity to reaffirm the benefits of the U.S.-Japan alliance for both nations,” said Congressman Castro. “Judge Sakai\\'s family was among the first Japanese Americans to settle in the Rio Grande Valley, and he has been a trailblazer for Asian American representation in Bexar County. His story is an example of the American Dream, and it was a privilege to host him and his wife Rachel as Prime Minister Kishida delivered an important message about the ties of history and friendship between the United States and Japan.” “Congressman Castro and I were honored to invite Bexar County Judge Peter Sakai and his wife, Rachel Sakai, to join us for Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio\\'s joint address to Congress. Judge Sakai, a second-generation Japanese American, is a strong advocate for Bexar County and South Texas,” said Congressman Cuellar. “I am also proud to be a member of the U.S.-Japan Caucus and believe in continued robust cooperation between our two nations. Japan is a trusted trade partner with the Lone Star State, and I look forward to strengthening this relationship and growing Texas’s trade economy.” \"I want to thank Congressman Joaquin Castro and Congressman Henry Cuellar for inviting Rachel and I to this very special event and look forward to working with them in the future as Bexar County continues to increase its global reach,” said Judge Peter Sakai. “Prime Minister Fumio Kishida\\'s remarks reaffirmed the strong alliance between the United States and Japan. It is critical for the two nations to work together for a global economy and security. Japan is a tremendous trade partner and integral to economic development in both Texas and Bexar County. The alliance the Prime Minister and Vice President Kamala Harris referenced in their remarks supports my vision to advance economic development in Bexar County.” Japan is the second-largest source of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) job creation in Texas and one of the top import partners for the Lone Star State. To further expand U.S.-Japan collaboration at the federal level, Congressman Castro established the bipartisan U.S.-Japan Caucus in 2014 to facilitate cooperation on issues of common interest between the United States and Japan.

A second-generation Japanese American, Sakai is the grandson of farmers who left Japan to build new lives in the United States. His maternal grandparents immigrated to South Texas, where they became one of the earliest Japanese families in the Rio Grande Valley. His father’s family immigrated to join the farming community in the Imperial Valley in California. Judge Sakai’s father, Pete, was a high school student in California during the outbreak of World War II and became a victim of the Japanese internment. Growing up, Judge Sakai’s passion for justice and public service was shaped by the stories of his father’s internment and the injustices committed against Japanese Americans during World War II. Mrs. Rachel Sakai was an educator, counselor, and administrator at Harlandale Independent School District for 32 years and retired after serving as the Director of the Gateway to College at Palo Alto College and working as a teacher/sponsor at Providence Catholic School.

The center would also be responsible for training and developing exceptional analysts and linguists with designated specialties. “The United States can’t afford to be in a position where our competitors know more about us than we know about them,” said Congressman Castro. “For generations, Congress supported open-source translation programs that helped Americans understand both our allies and our adversaries. As our investment in those programs have declined, countries like China and Russia have accelerated their own – putting us at a strategic disadvantage. The Open Translation Center will be an invaluable resource for American journalists, academics, and policymakers and will promote a 21st-century understanding of the global challenges and opportunities that we face.” “Our adversaries, namely the Chinese Communist Party, continue to grow increasingly aggressive across the world-stage. This poses a serious threat to American national security and in order to understand and combat these threats, it is imperative to be able to read and understand our adversaries’ primary sources,” said Congressman Gallagher. “Establishing an Open Translation and Analysis Center is an important, bipartisan step we can take in Congress to better understand and better defend the free world.” “To better understand threats from countries like China and Russia, compete on the world stage, and keep our families safe, we need accurate, up-to-date information about our competitors and adversaries.

       " 'Devex: New bill aims to give DFC watchdog law enforcement power WASHINGTON – Today, Reps. Joaquin Castro (TX-20) and Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-01) introduced the Enhancing Development Finance Corporation Oversight Act of 2024, bipartisan legislation that would grant law enforcement authority to the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the United States International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) in order to improve oversight and accountability of U.S. foreign aid programs. Six years ago, Reps. Castro and Fitzpatrick helped to establish the DFC as co-sponsors of the 2018 Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development Act (BUILD) Act. To ensure appropriate oversight over taxpayer dollars expended through the DFC, the BUILD Act simultaneously established the DFC OIG with a mission to prevent, detect, and deter waste, fraud, and abuse in DFC programs and operations. Until 2020, when the DFC OIG became operational, the OIG for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) provided oversight for DFC programs. While the USAID OIG has federal law enforcement authorities to conduct criminal investigations – including the authority to make arrests and obtain and execute search warrants - the DFC OIG does not currently possess these same authorities, constraining its oversight power. “Across the federal government, strong Inspectors General play an essential role in rooting out fraud and maintaining trust in government programs. As U.S. global development projects continue to expand, Congress needs to ensure that DFC’s OIG has the tools to maintain the highest level of integrity in DFC’s operations. This bipartisan bill will help the United States set a strong example of good governance at home and abroad, and I am thankful to Congressman Fitzpatrick for his partnership on this much-needed bipartisan reform,” said Congressman Castro. “The International Development Finance Corporation Office of Inspector General (DFC OIG) must be given law enforcement authority in order to properly provide oversight of its programs,” said Congressman Fitzpatrick. “I am proud to co-lead this bipartisan legislation with Rep. Castro that would improve oversight and accountability of U.S. foreign aid programs by granting the DFC OIG further authority to reduce unnecessary misuse of resources.” \"I applaud Congressman Joaquin Castro and Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick for re-introducing the Enhancing Development Finance Corporation Oversight Act, which will provide the DFC’s Office of Inspector General with the needed law enforcement authorities to identify and eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse.\\xa0 As a strong proponent of the DFC, I believe it is critical that the agency\\'s IG have the full suite of tools to properly conduct oversight of the agency\\'s operations.\\xa0 I commend Reps. Castro and Fitzpatrick for their leadership on this important issue, and I urge Congress to enact this legislation,\" said former Congressman Ted Yoho, lead author of the BUILD Act. “This bipartisan measure gives the DFC’s Office of Inspector General the same authority other federal OIG’s have to ensure strong oversight and accountability of agency projects,” said Rob Mosbacher, Jr., a member of the Modernizing Foreign Assistance Network who served as President and CEO of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) from 2005 to 2009. “I commend Congressman Castro and Fitzpatrick for their leadership.” Law enforcement authorities for Inspectors General are generally granted through the Inspector General Act of 1978, which outlines a process by which the U.S. Attorney General can delegate these authorities. The Department of Justice has indicated that it has no objections to providing law enforcement authority to the DFC OIG but has not moved to grant such authority. The Enhancing Development Finance Corporation Oversight Act of 2024 would restore appropriate law enforcement oversight to the DFC and ensure that agency programs continue to operate with integrity and efficiency.

       " 'Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Representative Jared Huffman (CA-02), Ranking Member of the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Water, Wildlife, and Fisheries, released the following statement regarding the Pacific Fishery Management Council’s vote to cancel salmon fishing season off the California: “Last year’s California’s salmon season closure was a crushing blow for our state. And now we’re facing the unprecedented back-to-back closures of the entire California salmon fishery.\\xa0 This is a new low – it’s not just devastating, it’s unacceptable,” said Rep. Huffman. “We just finished getting federal approval for last year’s California salmon disaster. I was relieved that with the reforms I’ve passed in Congress and all the political pressure we worked to build, the federal approval process was somewhat faster.\\xa0 But the amount of disaster money is not nearly enough for the needs of fishermen, tribes, businesses, and families who depend on healthy salmon fisheries – and now we have to start all over again for second consecutive disaster year. “We must do better. On disaster relief, the state must speed up the process for quantifying impacts and the federal government must approve disaster funds faster and at higher levels. But we must also acknowledge that this scramble for federal fishery disaster funds is not the solution to the terrible downward spiral for California salmon fisheries. The solution is to prevent fishery disasters.\\xa0 That requires confronting wrongheaded policies that are killing salmon – failing to protect cold water supplies, starving rivers and tributaries of flows salmon need to survive, and over-pumping in the Delta during sensitive times for migrating salmon,” Huffman concluded.  In February of this year, Rep. Huffman secured $20 million in relief funds through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for California’s fishing community. This followed continued pressure from the congressman to secure this relief for the 2023 Sacramento River Fall Chinook and Klamath River Fall Chinook and inland salmon fisheries disasters. In April 2023, Huffman, Padilla, and Panetta led their colleagues in an urgent letter to President Joe Biden and Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, calling for them to swiftly declare a federal fishery disaster. Earlier that month, Rep. Huffman held a press conference with Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, Representative Kevin Mullin, and fishing industry stakeholders to call attention to this disaster and highlight the people who will bear the brunt of the impacts of closing the salmon season. In addition to regular follow up with NOAA, Rep. Huffman held a call directly with NOAA Administrator Dr. Rick Spinrad to continue the pressure and encourage him to prompt action. As part of his long-standing efforts to improve disaster relief for fisheries, Congressman Huffman was able to help secure an additional $300 million for fishery disaster declarations Fiscal Year 2023 Omnibus Appropriations bill. Congress also authorized new bipartisan fishery disaster relief language based on Congressman Jared Huffman and Senator Roger Wicker’s Fishery Resource Disasters Improvement Act. This language streamlines the process for declaring a federal fishery disaster and helps to quickly provide relief to affected communities. It also extends eligibility for federal fishery disaster funds not only to commercial fisheries, but also to charter fishing businesses and impacted tribes.',\n",
       " 'Water, Wildlife, and Fisheries Subcommittee Ranking Member Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member Raúl M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.),\\xa0 Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.), Rep. Susie Lee (D-Nev.), and Mike Levin (D-Calif.) today issued the following statements applauding the Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM) final rule for onshore oil and gas leasing on public lands. The rule reflects long overdue fiscal reforms that were passed in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), including increased onshore royalty rates, minimum bid amounts, and rental rates; a new fee to nominate public lands for leasing; and an end to noncompetitive leasing. The rule also strengthens bonding requirements for the first time since 1960. “Democrats fought long and hard to pass reforms in the Inflation Reduction Act to stop Big Oil from abusing our public lands at the cost of our communities and our climate, and this finalized rule by the Biden-Harris administration is going to ensure those reforms are implemented,” said Rep. Huffman. “This is a huge step in putting people over polluters instead of letting fossil fuel and mining industries pad their pockets and plunder our public lands with impunity.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 “When Big Oil uses our public lands, it stands to reason that they should be giving American taxpayers a fair return for the privilege,” said Ranking Member Grijalva. “That’s why Democrats worked so hard to pass reforms in the Inflation Reduction Act to return some balance to a leasing system that has favored polluters for far too long. The Biden administration is taking an important step in moving those reforms forward with this new rule. The ultimate goal is phasing out fossil fuels for good, but these new taxpayer protections will help make sure the American people aren’t getting ripped off in the meantime.” “For over a century, Big Oil has paid pennies on the acre to drill on our public lands—and then left taxpayers on the hook to clean up the mess,” said Rep. Katie Porter. “In Congress, I’ve fought to get rid of Big Oil’s sweetheart deal to pollute our public lands. I’m proud my proposals to end this reckless disregard for the environment—and our taxpayer dollars—are now law, and I applaud the Biden Administration for putting these much-needed reforms into action.”  “I represent working families in southern Nevada – not Big Oil & Gas. Public lands belong in public hands, not tied up in costly and unproductive fossil fuel speculation,” said Rep. Susie Lee. “Over 80 percent of Nevada lands are public lands, and I’ve made it a top priority to protect our resources and taxpayers from the outdated and wasteful approach of our speculative leasing system. Today’s announcement is another major step toward fixing the broken elements of this system, in line with my End Speculative Oil and Gas Leasing Act. I will continue to work toward a diverse, clean, and efficient energy economy that unleashes our state’s energy potential while lowering costs and protecting our public lands.”  “I applaud the Biden Administration for issuing this final rule to promote conservation and ensure a fair financial return on the profits fossil fuel companies make off our public lands,” said Rep. Levin. “The rule ends giveaways of our public lands to fossil fuel companies, holds companies accountable for cleanup costs, and updates outdated fiscal terms for onshore oil and gas leases, all while protecting our important environmental and cultural resources. Taxpayers should never foot the bill for cleaning up after Big Oil. I’m proud to see provisions of legislation I introduced included in this rule to elevate the interests of the American people over fossil fuel companies’ profits.” Background The rule reflects legislation championed by Natural Resources Committee Democrats, including the following: 117th Congress: 118th Congress:',\n",
       " '\\xa0 [WASHINGTON, D.C.] – U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) released the following statement after the Civilian Office of Police Accountability today released bodycam footage capturing the fatal police shooting of 26-year-old Dexter Reed on March 21 in Chicago: “The video released today and the violence captured in it is shocking and disheartening. My thoughts are with the friends, family and loved ones of Dexter Reed as they continue to mourn his tragic death. I’m also hoping for a full recovery of the Chicago Police officer who was shot during this incident, and I share the Mayor’s view that attempting to murder a law enforcement officer must never condoned or excused. “As the investigation into this horrible incident continues, we must allow it to play out fairly and responsibly. As that happens, we must also refocus our efforts to bolster investments in comprehensive crime prevention initiatives, enhance efforts to keep illegal firearms off the streets and strengthen accountability over the Chicago Police Department, which must continue the hard work of rebuilding trust through transparency.” -30-  ',\n",
       " '\\xa0 [WASHINGTON, D.C.] – U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) issued the following statement after the Arizona Supreme Court issued a ruling that effectively upheld a near-total abortion ban in that state by allowing a law written during the Civil War in 1864—which criminalizes abortion for patients, providers and anyone who helps a patient obtain an abortion with exceptions only to save the mother’s life—to be “prospectively” enforced. This ruling from the Arizona Supreme Court could never have happened had Donald Trump not successfully overturned Roe v. Wade with his appointments to the U.S. Supreme Court—something he is proud to have done. “Make no mistake: Donald Trump is solely responsible for reviving Arizona’s 160-year-old, near-total abortion ban, just as he is solely responsible for Florida’s 6 week ban—and the threats to IVF access around the country we’ve seen in recent years.  “Again and again, Donald Trump brags about being the one responsible for overturning Roe v. Wade, which eviscerated women’s rights to basic healthcare and set us back decades. And now, thanks to him, the Arizona Supreme Court just dragged women in that state back to the Civil War era. “A woman’s most intimate health decisions should not be up for debate in every state and they should not be decided by extreme right-wing judges in Arizona or any other state in America. To protect abortion, IVF and reproductive freedom for women everywhere, Congress must restore Roe and enshrine full reproductive rights into federal law immediately.” Throughout her time in the Senate, Duckworth has made protecting reproductive freedom in the face of Republicans’ anti-choice crusade a top priority. Duckworth is the lead sponsor of the\\xa0Access to Family Building Act, legislation that would establish a federal right for patients to access IVF, for healthcare providers to provide IVF if they want to as well as for insurance companies to cover IVF. In February, Duckworth\\xa0led a group of Senate Democrats\\xa0in calling for the bill’s passage through unanimous consent, but U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS) objected, blocking the effort. This was the second time\\xa0Senate Republicans blocked Duckworth-led legislation\\xa0that would protect access to IVF nationwide. The\\xa0Access to Family Building Act\\xa0builds on\\xa0previous legislation\\xa0she introduced in 2022. Duckworth was the first Senator to give birth while serving in office and had both of her children with the help of IVF. In 2018 she\\xa0advocated\\xa0for the Senate to change its rules so she could bring her infant onto the Senate floor.\\xa0She has made protecting and expanding access to essential reproductive healthcare a top priority. -30-  ',\n",
       " '\\xa0 [WASHINGTON, DC] – U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), co-founder and co-chair of both the U.S. Senate Environmental Justice Caucus and the U.S. Senate Lead Task Force, today released the following statement commending the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for announcing the first-ever legally enforceable limit on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in drinking water for 5 PFAs chemicals including, PFOA, PFOS and GenX—which will require water systems to monitor and abate PFAS contamination—along with $1 billion in available federal funding to help treat these chemicals. This funding comes directly from the $9 billion included in Duckworth’s Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act (DWWIA) provided for treatment of emerging contaminants that was signed into law as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The final rule will reduce PFAS exposure for approximately 100 million people, preventing thousands of deaths and reducing tens of thousands of serious illnesses. “As we continue working to ensure all Americans—no matter the color of their skin or their zip code—have access to clean and safe drinking water, I’m relieved that the Biden Administration is taking major action today to protect our children and public health with its first-ever legally enforceable limit on PFAS in our drinking water. This new rule, and the federal funding that comes through my DWWIA law, will help clean up communities that have been impacted by the devastating long-term health impacts of PFAS while doing much more to prevent these ‘forever chemicals’ from poisoning our water, air or land in the first place. I look forward to continuing to work with the Biden Administration to safeguard our environment and protect children and families from toxic pollutants while helping improve environmental justice for all.” -30-  ',\n",
       " '\\xa0 [WASHINGTON, D.C.] – U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) this week met with Chicago Regional Transportation Authority (RTA) Executive Director Leanne Redden and other RTA leaders and members to discuss the agency’s funding and priorities for the upcoming Fiscal Year 2025. The RTA region’s system provides more than two million rides each weekday on bus and rail services in Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry and Will counties and serves approximately 8.4 million residents. A photo of this meeting is available on the Senator’s website. “Millions of Chicagoland residents rely on the CTA, Metra and Pace to get to work, school and so much more every day, so it’s critical these transit providers have the support they need to ensure safe, easy and efficient travel,” said Duckworth. “It was great to meet with RTA leaders to learn how they are committed to accelerating their transition to a zero-emission system and their continued commitment to safety and accessibility, and I will do everything I can to ensure they have the support needed from the federal level.” Duckworth is a member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation and is a strong advocate for federal support to improve our nation’s infrastructure and make it more accessible for all. Duckworth’s\\xa0All Stations Accessibility Program (ASAP) Act\\xa0provisions were included\\xa0in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which is providing $1.75 billion over five years to help build ramps, install elevators and make other improvements to help ensure our nation’s transit systems are actually, finally usable for those with disabilities. -30-  ',\n",
       " '\\xa0 [WASHINGTON, DC] – Combat Veteran and U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL)—a member of both the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) and U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee (SFRC)—secured support from U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Secretary Lloyd Austin for a proposal she plans to push strongly to be included in the Fiscal Year 2025 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) aimed at improving DoD medical readiness and ensuring servicemembers and their families have access to quality patient care throughout the Indo-Pacific region—whether during peacetime or in the event of a conflict abroad. Duckworth’s proposal would build on an existing framework that the DoD already has with the Republic of Korea—an agreement that helps patients get quicker medical care without worrying about navigating a foreign healthcare system alone—to ultimately make medical care accessible to U.S. servicemembers and their families across the Indo-Pacific. Additionally, her proposal would ensure any future foreign hospital that the DoD selects and partners with will undergo an accreditation process to help ensure that the quality of care provided to our servicemembers abroad meets U.S. standards for patient care. Full video of Senator Duckworth’s remarks can be found on YouTube. “It is our collective responsibility to ensure the Department of Defense has adequate military treatment facilities for servicemembers and their families during peacetime and in the event of a conflict,” said Duckworth during yesterday’s SASC hearing. “Should there be conflict in the region, getting patients to medical facilities abroad during the ‘golden hour’ where lives can still be saved will be difficult to achieve due to the great distances within the Indo-Pacific. I would like DoD to establish a medical readiness program in the Indo-Pacific to address current gaps in DoD’s medical capacity, allowing DoD to access accredited foreign medical facilities for patient care while also creating a medical readiness strategy in the region.” “I agree with you,” said Secretary Austin in response to Senator Duckworth’s questioning. “I think Korea is a great example from talking to our troops and family members. They really appreciate having the ability to do what you described and take advantage of existing capability.” In November 2023, the DoD Office of Inspector General released a report identifying repeated challenges that servicemembers and their families face when trying to access quality health care in the Indo-Pacific region, including staffing shortages and limited Tricare network providers. At certain military treatment facilities, many servicemembers are also confronted with limited specialty care, such as obstetrics and physical therapy, impacting their quality of life. Duckworth is a proven leader when it comes to strengthening our relations with Indo-Pacific nations and improving security in the region—which she has done while successfully securing significant international investments in Illinois. Last year, Duckworth\\xa0led an official visit\\xa0to\\xa0Japan\\xa0and\\xa0Indonesia\\xa0as part of her continuing efforts to strengthen ties and reinforce support between allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific region and the United States.\\xa0And last summer, Duckworth led another official visit to the Indo-Pacific region again,\\xa0visiting\\xa0Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines to meet with government and business leaders and discuss opportunities that would increase cooperation in areas of mutual interest, such as economic investments, regional stability and national security. Duckworth also successfully included a modified version of her\\xa0Strengthen Taiwan’s Security Act in\\xa0the\\xa0Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)\\xa0to help Taiwan strengthen its military defenses. -30-  ',\n",

I still believe that conversation is urgently needed.\\xa0 Our communities deserve real transparency in policing and real accountability for misconduct.” “Proposals for more comprehensive reforms to policing, such as the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, have also been made.\\xa0 We need to pass these reforms to fully repair the relationship between law enforcement and the communities they serve.\\xa0 And, we can do more to leverage the expertise and capacity of the COPS Office to advance community-oriented policing that serves and protects us.” Video of Durbin’s opening statement is available here.

       " \"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today questioned Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS Office) Director Hugh T. Clements during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing entitled “Oversight of the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Grant Program.”\\xa0 Today’s hearing, the first full Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on oversight of the COPS Program since its creation in 1994, examined the COPS Program and its efforts to promote community-oriented policing practices at law enforcement agencies across the country. Durbin began his questioning of Director Clements by asking him how he interpreted the impact of the COPS Program during his time as a police officer and police chief. “When I dial 911, if God forbid I’m in that position, I pray to God that the person who responds has been carefully recruited, carefully trained, and is ready to come to the aid of my family as quickly as possible.\\xa0 I’m counting on that.\\xa0 I think every American is counting on that no matter where they live.\\xa0 So the question obviously is, does the COPS Program make that likelihood better or not?... You have been a real cop, starting [with] patrolling the beat and working your way up the department.\\xa0 Did you see a measurable impact of federal COPS funds on your performance in your police department?” Durbin asked. Director Clements replied that the COPS Program funding has made a difference in his former department, noting that the COPS Office supported his department in building community partnerships as well as in securing training and technical assistance. Durbin then asked Director Clements to describe what the COPS Program has done to address pervasive patterns of racism and discrimination in policing practices, which have historically harmed the relationship between communities of color and law enforcement. “There's no question that the United States still struggles with the issue of race.\\xa0 It still struggles with the issue of immigrants, and how they are to be treated by our agencies and government, and certainly how they are treated on the streets and neighborhoods of this country on a regular basis.\\xa0 We have seen some outrageous examples.\\xa0 George Floyd comes to mind immediately.\\xa0 And we have heard rhetoric from some political figures who are branding immigrants as not even humans but calling them animals.\\xa0 That sort of rhetoric and that sort of conduct really puts special pressure on the police.\\xa0 Can you tell me if the COPS Program addresses this in any way?” Durbin asked. In response, Director Clements pointed to the COPS Hiring Program (CHP).\\xa0 He explained that CHP prioritizes agencies and law enforcement executives who have an implementation plan that incorporates community members in an effort to establish trust between residents and officers. Durbin then spoke about his visits to a police training academy in Chicago.\\xa0 During those visits, Durbin met with members of the Chicago Police Department, who expressed concern that videos of police interactions are often clipped or removed from a broader context before being shared online.\\xa0 “On four or five different occasions, I have put up a notice at the police training academy in Chicago that I’m going to be sitting in a classroom for an hour and invite any member of the police force from that community who wants to come in for an off-the-record, no-holds-barred conversation to come on down.\\xa0 And they show up… They want to tell their side of the story.\\xa0 They want me to understand what it means to wear that shield and risk your life on the streets on a daily basis and how you have to make momentary – just a few seconds of judgment could be life or death - judgement for yourself, for innocent people around you, or the victim.\\xa0 And how tough that is and how they sometimes think it's unfair that there are clips taken from videos that don’t tell whole story,” Durbin said. “Do you deal with that? Have you dealt with that in your capacity as chief and with the COPS Program?” Durbin asked Director Clements. Director Clements affirmed that police officers struggle with this aspect of their profession.\\xa0 Director Clements explained that officers often arrive on a scene with little information about the situation, unsure of whether they will need to operate a rescue mission or respond tactically to a threat.\\xa0 He concluded his response that the COPS Program has made training more accessible for departments in order to support officers in responding to calls appropriately.

In 1994, the Democratic-controlled Congress passed, and President Clinton signed into law, the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, authorizing $8.8 billion in new spending over six years to create the COPS Program.\\xa0 Since the creation of the COPS Program nearly thirty years ago, Congress has appropriated more than $20 billion for grants awarded through the program.

       " 'WASHINGTON – U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, along with U.S. Senators Gary Peters?(D-MI), Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and Ron Wyden (D-OR), Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, introduced legislation to address historic levels of fraud within federal funds that were passed to help Americans through the COVID-19 pandemic. The Fraud Prevention and Recovery Act includes key resources and programs that will strengthen efforts to recover stolen pandemic funds, hold bad actors accountable, prevent identify theft and ensure taxpayer dollars are being used effectively.\\xa0 The legislation also includes critical safeguards that will prevent future fraud and improper use of federal relief funds.  “During the pandemic, we saw a significant increase in fraud and identity theft,” said Durbin.\\xa0 “In line with President Biden’s historic efforts to address these issues, we introduced legislation to provide law enforcement with the tools necessary to identify the individuals responsible for fraud, prosecute them, and support the innocent victims.\\xa0 We must recover the funds stolen from the American people and bring to justice the perpetrators who committed this fraud.” “When Congress passed critical relief to help Americans weather the COVID-19 crisis, criminals and bad actors took advantage of those important resources to line their own pockets,” said Peters.\\xa0“I fought to ensure real-time oversight efforts were included in those packages, and the legislation I’ve introduced today with Senators Durbin and Wyden will build on that by adding new tools to recoup stolen funds, protect Americans from identify theft, and protect against future fraud.” “Senate Democrats take a back seat to nobody when it comes to fighting fraud and abuse in federal programs, and the Biden administration is standing with us to protect the American people and their taxpayer dollars,”\\xa0said Wyden. “This bill would make big progress cracking down on\\xa0identity fraud and criminal abuses of our unemployment insurance system.\\xa0We also\\xa0know that fighting fraud and improving essential programs are not mutually exclusive. We’ve got to do both.”  Bad actors exploited the resources made available during the COVID-19 crisis, leading to historic levels of fraud of government programs, diverting crucial investments for American communities.\\xa0 The Fraud Prevention and Recovery Act seeks to hold those bad actors accountable and recover stolen funds, as well as establishes safeguards to protect against future fraud, and strengthens systems to combat identity theft and provide support to victims of identity theft.  A summary of the legislation is available here and key provisions are highlighted below: Prosecute perpetrators of major fraud in pandemic programs and recover stolen funds:  The legislation will provide vital resources to the Offices of Inspector General (OIGs) to investigate people who committed pandemic fraud and recover the taxpayer dollars they stole. Every dollar invested in their work generates $10 in taxpayer savings—a tremendous return on investment.  Enhances safeguards and improve data checks to prevent future fraud: The bill would enhance the Treasury Department’s ‘Do Not Pay’ service, which empowers federal agencies to detect and prevent improper payments.\\xa0 This measure alone would help prevent at least $13 billion in illicit payments.  Expand Department of Justice pandemic fraud teams:  Provides robust resources to support the Department of Justice’s program to combat fraud and prosecute those who stole COVID-19 relief funds.\\xa0 The “Strike Force” teams have helped DOJ seize over $1.4 billion in stolen funds as of 2023. Expanding these teams would help recover more taxpayer dollars, targeting criminal syndicates and major fraudulent actors. Safeguards taxpayer dollars & supports victims of fraud: The legislation will create a new fund to help federal agencies prevent fraud and identity theft. It would create a new early warning system fordetecting fraud.\\xa0 The system would notify individuals and groups when their information is being verified by the federal government.\\xa0 It would also develop privacy-preserving identity validation services at the Social Security Administration and bolster the federal government’s capacity to help individuals who were victims of identity theft.']"

Washington, D.C. – At a hearing to review the Fiscal Year 2025 budget request for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Senator Susan Collins, Vice Chair of the Appropriations Committee, called on Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas to help find a solution to staffing issues found at Maine’s ports that are threatening the arrival of international cruise ships in Eastport this fall.\\xa0 During the hearing, Senator Collins also highlighted her concern that the President’s budget request does not do enough to address the flood of illegal migrants and fentanyl entering the United States. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials recently informed the City of Eastport that the agency cannot accommodate the four planned international cruise ship arrivals this fall, even though CBP staffed a larger number of international cruise ship arrivals in Eastport last year, and Bar Harbor is seeing a reduction in international cruise ship arrivals. “The cruise ship industry is vital to many Maine communities and delivers millions in economic benefits to our state annually.\\xa0 This is the flip side of the problems that we're now seeing on the southwest border, creating also problems on the northeast border and northern border in general,” said Senator Collins.\\xa0 “Mr. Secretary, what I'm asking from you today is to look into this staffing issue and follow up with me, to try to resolve this problem.” “The Eastport Port Authority thanks Senator Susan Collins for taking the time to bring real issues, affecting real operations in our parts of the world to the forefront.\\xa0 To see a Cabinet Secretary have a hearing start off by being asked specifically about issues of our port, and our friends to the south in nearby Bar Harbor, shows that good representation matters,” said Chris Gardner, Executive Director for the Port of Eastport.\\xa0 “Let us hope this work lends itself to us to finding the solutions we need to continue to grow our port and continue to bring much needed economic activity to the entire region.” Last year, Senator Collins raised similar concerns to Secretary Mayorkas when CBP refused to provide services to an international ferry service between Bar Harbor and Nova Scotia unless the ferry service paid the full annual salaries of four CBP officials – even though the ferry only utilizes CBP services for a few months each year. ###\"]"
