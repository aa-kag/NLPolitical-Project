The announcement comes after Stanton and Grijalva sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne Criswell, urging them to quickly allocate funding under the replenished SSP and ensure border communities were prioritized.  Maricopa County will receive $11,606,329, Pima County will receive $21,827,581, World Hunger in Maricopa will receive $11,606,329, and World Hunger in Yuma will receive $9,532,854.  \\u201cThis funding couldn\\u2019t come soon enough. I\\u2019ve visited local aid groups along the border, and they\\u2019re near a breaking point\\u2014over-stretching their budgets to help care for migrant families and prevent street releases,\\u201d Stanton said. \\u201cI\\u2019ll keep working to make sure Arizona communities get their fair share of federal resources to manage this crisis.\\u201d  \\u201cI appreciate the Biden administration\\u2019s swiftness to allocate this federal funding to Arizona. I will continue to work with federal, state, local, and non-governmental organizations to ensure this funding is distributed expeditiously. As Southern Arizona communities continue to deal with the humanitarian crisis, it\\u2019s critical we provide them with the resources and funding they need,\\u201d Grijalva said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s clear that the only path forward to address these issues long-term is real immigration reform to fix our broken system beginning with humane solutions, increased legal pathways, dealing with root causes, and providing more resources and personnel at the border instead of Republicans\\u2019 detrimental funding cuts and failed enforcement-only policies.\\u201d  FEMA also announced several key changes to the program\\u2014including two common-sense fixes Stanton urged Biden Administration officials to make in a December letter.

Yet, for months, many Democrats have refused to speak out against the protests.  Sadly, this is no surprise. Antisemitism is a disease that the Far-Left, along with liberal university leaders, has allowed to spread.  In fact, over the past year, we have watched Democrats spread anti-Israel rhetoric time and time again. Some have called for Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to be replaced, one said it was an \\u201chonor\\u201d to visit with the pro-Hamas protestors at Columbia University, one defended the phrase \\u201cfrom the river to the sea\\u201d, which implies the destruction of Israel, one denounced Israel as a \\u201cracist state,\\u201d and more.  In addition, Far-Left Democrats in the House of Representatives have repeatedly voted against legislation supporting Israel. Back in October, immediately following Hamas\\u2019 barbaric October 7th attack on Israel, nine Democrats voted against a resolution to stand with Israel as it defended itself from the terrorist group. Then, again, just a few weeks ago, thirteen Democrats voted against condemning Iran\\u2019s missile attack on Israel.  The recent actions of the Democrats with respect to Israel are both outrageous and inappropriate. They truly seem to have lost all sense of moral and political clarity and have made it very clear - the Far-Left has a serious anti-Israel problem.  I couldn\\u2019t disagree with their views of Israel more.  Israel is our closest friend and ally in the Middle East, and the only democracy in the region. They are under assault by Iran, the largest state sponsor of terrorism and a deadly enemy to both Israel and the United States, and Hamas, a terrorist group who not only ruthlessly murdered over 1,200 Israelis on October 7, 2023, but also still holds over one hundred hostages, including five Americans.  These attacks on Israel are defining moments. Yet, instead of leading through strength and proving to the rest of the world that the United States remains steadfast in our commitment to Israel\\u2019s security, many Democrats have publicly criticized our democratic ally. This is both unthinkable and unprecedented, as their actions are driving a rift between the United States and its closest ally, playing into the objectives of the terrorists.   Although I have no faith that they will, I am calling on all of them, as well as the morally bankrupt university leaders who are allowing pro-terrorist protests on their campuses, to stand with our great ally, Israel, at this critical moment.   As the Leader of the Free World, we must support our allies, work together, and lead through with strength. To do anything else is a public betrayal to our friends in Israel and effectively supports an enemy to civilized people around the world.

The announcement comes after Stanton and Grijalva sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne Criswell, urging them to quickly allocate funding under the replenished SSP and ensure border communities were prioritized.  Maricopa County will receive $11,606,329, Pima County will receive $21,827,581, World Hunger in Maricopa will receive $11,606,329, and World Hunger in Yuma will receive $9,532,854.  \\u201cThis funding couldn\\u2019t come soon enough.

I will continue to work with federal, state, local, and non-governmental organizations to ensure this funding is distributed expeditiously.

Yet, for months, many Democrats have refused to speak out against the protests.  Sadly, this is no surprise. Antisemitism is a disease that the Far-Left, along with liberal university leaders, has allowed to spread.  In fact, over the past year, we have watched Democrats spread anti-Israel rhetoric time and time again. Some have called for Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to be replaced, one said it was an \\u201chonor\\u201d to visit with the pro-Hamas protestors at Columbia University, one defended the phrase \\u201cfrom the river to the sea\\u201d, which implies the destruction of Israel, one denounced Israel as a \\u201cracist state,\\u201d and more.  In addition, Far-Left Democrats in the House of Representatives have repeatedly voted against legislation supporting Israel. Back in October, immediately following Hamas\\u2019 barbaric October 7th attack on Israel, nine Democrats voted against a resolution to stand with Israel as it defended itself from the terrorist group. Then, again, just a few weeks ago, thirteen Democrats voted against condemning Iran\\u2019s missile attack on Israel.  The recent actions of the Democrats with respect to Israel are both outrageous and inappropriate. They truly seem to have lost all sense of moral and political clarity and have made it very clear - the Far-Left has a serious anti-Israel problem.  I couldn\\u2019t disagree with their views of Israel more.  Israel is our closest friend and ally in the Middle East, and the only democracy in the region. They are under assault by Iran, the largest state sponsor of terrorism and a deadly enemy to both Israel and the United States, and Hamas, a terrorist group who not only ruthlessly murdered over 1,200 Israelis on October 7, 2023, but also still holds over one hundred hostages, including five Americans.  These attacks on Israel are defining moments. Yet, instead of leading through strength and proving to the rest of the world that the United States remains steadfast in our commitment to Israel\\u2019s security, many Democrats have publicly criticized our democratic ally. This is both unthinkable and unprecedented, as their actions are driving a rift between the United States and its closest ally, playing into the objectives of the terrorists.   Although I have no faith that they will, I am calling on all of them, as well as the morally bankrupt university leaders who are allowing pro-terrorist protests on their campuses, to stand with our great ally, Israel, at this critical moment.   As the Leader of the Free World, we must support our allies, work together, and lead through with strength. To do anything else is a public betrayal to our friends in Israel and effectively supports an enemy to civilized people around the world.

I condemned the attack by Iran, as well as the precipitating hostilities that led to the attack, and I called for immediate de-escalation to reduce the threat of these actions widening into a larger regional conflict.\\u00a0I also supported President Biden\\u2019s actions, along with allies, in thwarting the Iranian attack and defending Israel against those threats.\\u00a0 \\u201cI voted no on this resolution because I am concerned that it further escalates the situation at exactly the time that we need to do the opposite. It does not mention the precipitating strike on the Iranian embassy by Israel that led to this attack. It \\u2018fully supports\\u2019 further offensive action by Israel and calls for continued arms sales to Israel. It makes no distinction between aid to Israel for defensive purposes\\u2014such as the Iron Dome funding or against threats from Hezbollah and Iran\\u2014versus aid to Israel for offensive strikes against innocent civilians in Gaza. While I continue to support defensive aid to Israel, I have been clear that I cannot support offensive military aid to Israel with no strings attached while the Netanyahu government continues to kill innocent civilians in Gaza \\u2014 both through military action and the blocking of humanitarian aid leading to famine. \\u201cThis is a time to de-escalate the conflict, not promote retaliatory violence, and I appreciate President Biden\\u2019s leadership on this issue. It is also of the utmost importance to achieve an immediate ceasefire to end the killing of innocents, return the hostages, and create a path for peace and security in the region.

I wanted to share an update on the work I did this week in Congress. On Thursday, I joined a bipartisan group of Appropriations Committee members in a visit to Baltimore\\u2019s Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse. We visited the site by boat, were briefed at the U.S. Coast Guard Command Center, and met with local officials to discuss the role of the federal government in assisting with the recovery. Visiting the site in person made it clear just how important the rebuilding of this critical land and sea thoroughfare is. It also highlighted the need for local, state and federal partners to work together on this project. As the lead Democrat on the Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the Department of Transportation, I am committed to ensuring that our country is not only able to address emergencies like this one but also taking preemptive steps to repair damaged bridges and roads that could lead to our next disaster. The Bipartisan Infrastructure bill took critical steps to address this need and Congress must now work to fill any remaining gaps. I will continue working with my colleagues on both side of the aisle and in both chambers until our tunnels, bridges, and roads are the envy of the world. Thanks to funding provided by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Environmental Protection Agency announced the dedication of $3 billion to identify and replace lead service lines in states and territories to prevent lead exposure in drinking water and protect public health. I was pleased to see that $240 million of that funding will go directly towards our great state of Illinois. No matter where you live, everyone should have access to clean, safe drinking water. Today\\u2019s announcement is another win in the fight to see this mission through and replace dangerous lead service lines in Illinois. With efforts like these, we can build a future in which access to safe drinking water is a right, not a privilege. As the Ranking Member on the Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development (THUD) Appropriations Subcommittee, I met with the Secretary of Transportation, Pete Buttigieg and the Acting Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Adrianne Todman to discuss their respective department's funding requests for the 2025 fiscal year. In my hearing with Secretary Buttigieg, we discussed protecting the safety of our transportation workers and the department's emergency relief fund in light of the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse. During my questioning of Secretary Todman, I asked if they anticipate additional funding needs for the Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery program and how the department is addressing rising homelessness. Both hearings provided critical insight to developing a THUD appropriations bill that will effectively address our nation's transit and housing needs. Don't forget, our office is always here to help.

The announcement comes after Stanton and Grijalva sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne Criswell, urging them to quickly allocate funding under the replenished SSP and ensure border communities were prioritized.  Maricopa County will receive $11,606,329, Pima County will receive $21,827,581, World Hunger in Maricopa will receive $11,606,329, and World Hunger in Yuma will receive $9,532,854.  \\u201cThis funding couldn\\u2019t come soon enough. I\\u2019ve visited local aid groups along the border, and they\\u2019re near a breaking point\\u2014over-stretching their budgets to help care for migrant families and prevent street releases,\\u201d Stanton said. \\u201cI\\u2019ll keep working to make sure Arizona communities get their fair share of federal resources to manage this crisis.\\u201d  \\u201cI appreciate the Biden administration\\u2019s swiftness to allocate this federal funding to Arizona. I will continue to work with federal, state, local, and non-governmental organizations to ensure this funding is distributed expeditiously. As Southern Arizona communities continue to deal with the humanitarian crisis, it\\u2019s critical we provide them with the resources and funding they need,\\u201d Grijalva said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s clear that the only path forward to address these issues long-term is real immigration reform to fix our broken system beginning with humane solutions, increased legal pathways, dealing with root causes, and providing more resources and personnel at the border instead of Republicans\\u2019 detrimental funding cuts and failed enforcement-only policies.\\u201d  FEMA also announced several key changes to the program\\u2014including two common-sense fixes Stanton urged Biden Administration officials to make in a December letter.

Yet, for months, many Democrats have refused to speak out against the protests.  Sadly, this is no surprise. Antisemitism is a disease that the Far-Left, along with liberal university leaders, has allowed to spread.  In fact, over the past year, we have watched Democrats spread anti-Israel rhetoric time and time again. Some have called for Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to be replaced, one said it was an \\u201chonor\\u201d to visit with the pro-Hamas protestors at Columbia University, one defended the phrase \\u201cfrom the river to the sea\\u201d, which implies the destruction of Israel, one denounced Israel as a \\u201cracist state,\\u201d and more.  In addition, Far-Left Democrats in the House of Representatives have repeatedly voted against legislation supporting Israel. Back in October, immediately following Hamas\\u2019 barbaric October 7th attack on Israel, nine Democrats voted against a resolution to stand with Israel as it defended itself from the terrorist group. Then, again, just a few weeks ago, thirteen Democrats voted against condemning Iran\\u2019s missile attack on Israel.  The recent actions of the Democrats with respect to Israel are both outrageous and inappropriate. They truly seem to have lost all sense of moral and political clarity and have made it very clear - the Far-Left has a serious anti-Israel problem.  I couldn\\u2019t disagree with their views of Israel more.  Israel is our closest friend and ally in the Middle East, and the only democracy in the region. They are under assault by Iran, the largest state sponsor of terrorism and a deadly enemy to both Israel and the United States, and Hamas, a terrorist group who not only ruthlessly murdered over 1,200 Israelis on October 7, 2023, but also still holds over one hundred hostages, including five Americans.  These attacks on Israel are defining moments. Yet, instead of leading through strength and proving to the rest of the world that the United States remains steadfast in our commitment to Israel\\u2019s security, many Democrats have publicly criticized our democratic ally. This is both unthinkable and unprecedented, as their actions are driving a rift between the United States and its closest ally, playing into the objectives of the terrorists.   Although I have no faith that they will, I am calling on all of them, as well as the morally bankrupt university leaders who are allowing pro-terrorist protests on their campuses, to stand with our great ally, Israel, at this critical moment.   As the Leader of the Free World, we must support our allies, work together, and lead through with strength. To do anything else is a public betrayal to our friends in Israel and effectively supports an enemy to civilized people around the world.

On April 10, 2024, former Editor of NPR, Uri Berliner, issued a scathing review of the news outlet claiming it has \\u201clost America\\u2019s trust.\\u201d Mr. Berliner resigned from NPR shortly after due to a lack of viewpoint diversity and a hard embrace of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) principles.

Yet, for months, many Democrats have refused to speak out against the protests.  Sadly, this is no surprise. Antisemitism is a disease that the Far-Left, along with liberal university leaders, has allowed to spread.  In fact, over the past year, we have watched Democrats spread anti-Israel rhetoric time and time again. Some have called for Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to be replaced, one said it was an \\u201chonor\\u201d to visit with the pro-Hamas protestors at Columbia University, one defended the phrase \\u201cfrom the river to the sea\\u201d, which implies the destruction of Israel, one denounced Israel as a \\u201cracist state,\\u201d and more.  In addition, Far-Left Democrats in the House of Representatives have repeatedly voted against legislation supporting Israel. Back in October, immediately following Hamas\\u2019 barbaric October 7th attack on Israel, nine Democrats voted against a resolution to stand with Israel as it defended itself from the terrorist group. Then, again, just a few weeks ago, thirteen Democrats voted against condemning Iran\\u2019s missile attack on Israel.  The recent actions of the Democrats with respect to Israel are both outrageous and inappropriate. They truly seem to have lost all sense of moral and political clarity and have made it very clear - the Far-Left has a serious anti-Israel problem.  I couldn\\u2019t disagree with their views of Israel more.  Israel is our closest friend and ally in the Middle East, and the only democracy in the region. They are under assault by Iran, the largest state sponsor of terrorism and a deadly enemy to both Israel and the United States, and Hamas, a terrorist group who not only ruthlessly murdered over 1,200 Israelis on October 7, 2023, but also still holds over one hundred hostages, including five Americans.  These attacks on Israel are defining moments. Yet, instead of leading through strength and proving to the rest of the world that the United States remains steadfast in our commitment to Israel\\u2019s security, many Democrats have publicly criticized our democratic ally. This is both unthinkable and unprecedented, as their actions are driving a rift between the United States and its closest ally, playing into the objectives of the terrorists.   Although I have no faith that they will, I am calling on all of them, as well as the morally bankrupt university leaders who are allowing pro-terrorist protests on their campuses, to stand with our great ally, Israel, at this critical moment.   As the Leader of the Free World, we must support our allies, work together, and lead through with strength.

In a letter to the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citi, the Senators press the banks to provide data on wire fraud at their banks and information about their current policies to protect consumers from financial devastation. \\u201cConsumers use wire transfers to send large dollar amounts, often to purchase a home or make significant investments, meaning wire fraud is often a life-changing event that can wipe out consumers\\u2019 savings or irreparably damage their finances,\\u201d the Senators wrote. \\u201cBanks have a responsibility to proactively monitor and prevent unauthorized and fraudulently induced transactions. We believe banks should reimburse their customers when they fail to meet these obligations\\u2026. With improved fraud prevention and reimbursement practices, consumers would no longer be left on the hook to the tune of billions of dollars annually.\\u201d In 2023, consumers lost more than $10 billion due to fraud \\u2013 up 14 percent from the year before. According to the Federal Trade Commission, in terms of dollars lost, \\u201cBank Transfer or Payment\\u201d is the largest payment method used by fraudsters. Brown has long pushed to hold big financial institutions accountable to protect consumers from fraud and scams. Earlier this year, Brown and his colleagues pushed the CEO of Zelle to publicly clarify their reimbursement policy for imposter scams, reimburse customers for additional types of scams, and streamline the process for consumers to report unauthorized transactions, scams, and fraud. In December, he also pressed the CEOs of Venmo and Cash App to adopt new policies to reimburse consumers who get scammed, and make it easier for users to report scams and fraud on these platforms. ###\",\n          \"WASHINGTON, DC \\u2013 Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-1) statement on the Environmental Protection Agency announcing a national drinking water standard to address PFAS (per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances) chemicals in drinking water: \\\"As Co-Chair of the bipartisan Congressional PFAS Task Force, I am pleased with today\\u2019s announcement from the Environmental Protection Agency finally establishing a national drinking water standard for PFAS (per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances) chemicals,\\\" said Congressman Fitzpatrick. \\\"Since first arriving to Congress, I have called for a standard to restrict the levels of these dangerous 'forever chemicals' in our communities\\u2019 drinking water and advocated for long-term health studies to understand the health impacts of PFAS \\u2013 especially in the former Naval Air Warfare Center and Horsham Air Guard Station in my district.\\u00a0This final rule is another critical step in the right direction in protecting the American people from PFAS exposure and related health complications.\\u00a0Our work is far from complete. I look forward to continuing to advocate for federal investments in research and remediation efforts that will ensure that water sources are clean and safe for generations to come.\\\" Permalink: https://fitzpatrick.house.gov/2024/4/statement-on-epa-establishing-a-national-drinking-water-standard\",\n          \"WASHINGTON \\u2013 Today, U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, met with Alyssandra Abrenica, a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipient from Illinois who moved to America from the Philippines when she was four years old. Ms. Abrenica is currently pursuing a career in psychiatry as a resident at the University of Wisconsin, and she is a passionate advocate for DACA. The pair discussed Durbin\\u2019s Dream Act, bipartisan legislation that would allow noncitizens without lawful status who were brought to the United States as children and meet certain education or work requirements to earn lawful permanent residence. These young people, known as Dreamers, have lived in America since they were children, built their lives here, and are American in every way except for their immigration status.\\u00a0 However, under current law, there is often no chance for them to ever become citizens and fulfill their potential.\\u00a0 \\u201cAlyssandra is on a trailblazing path to serving her community as a psychiatrist, and I was honored to talk with her today. Every Dreamer whom I\\u2019ve met has a unique and inspiring story like Alyssandra\\u2019s, but one theme repeatedly emerges: fear of deportation. I\\u2019ve shared almost 150 stories from Dreamers across our country on the Senate floor, because their stories are the embodiment of the American dream. These young people are business owners, teachers, parents, athletes, scientists, nurses, health care workers, musicians\\u2026 and it\\u2019s time for Congress to get to work and pass the Dream Act once and for all,\\u201d said Durbin. Photos of the meeting are available here. As the lead author of the Dream Act and Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Durbin has been a champion for immigration reform for years.\\u00a0 Durbin, along with seven of his Republican and Democratic colleagues, authored a comprehensive immigration reform that would have made critical reforms to our immigration system and addressed many of the challenges our nation faces at the border today.\\u00a0 That legislation passed the Senate with bipartisan support in 2013 but did not receive a vote in the Republican-controlled House. -30-\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

In a letter to the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citi, the Senators press the banks to provide data on wire fraud at their banks and information about their current policies to protect consumers from financial devastation. \\u201cConsumers use wire transfers to send large dollar amounts, often to purchase a home or make significant investments, meaning wire fraud is often a life-changing event that can wipe out consumers\\u2019 savings or irreparably damage their finances,\\u201d the Senators wrote. \\u201cBanks have a responsibility to proactively monitor and prevent unauthorized and fraudulently induced transactions. We believe banks should reimburse their customers when they fail to meet these obligations\\u2026. With improved fraud prevention and reimbursement practices, consumers would no longer be left on the hook to the tune of billions of dollars annually.\\u201d In 2023, consumers lost more than $10 billion due to fraud \\u2013 up 14 percent from the year before. According to the Federal Trade Commission, in terms of dollars lost, \\u201cBank Transfer or Payment\\u201d is the largest payment method used by fraudsters. Brown has long pushed to hold big financial institutions accountable to protect consumers from fraud and scams. Earlier this year, Brown and his colleagues pushed the CEO of Zelle to publicly clarify their reimbursement policy for imposter scams, reimburse customers for additional types of scams, and streamline the process for consumers to report unauthorized transactions, scams, and fraud. In December, he also pressed the CEOs of Venmo and Cash App to adopt new policies to reimburse consumers who get scammed, and make it easier for users to report scams and fraud on these platforms. ###\",\n          \"WASHINGTON, DC \\u2013 Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-1) statement on the Environmental Protection Agency announcing a national drinking water standard to address PFAS (per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances) chemicals in drinking water: \\\"As Co-Chair of the bipartisan Congressional PFAS Task Force, I am pleased with today\\u2019s announcement from the Environmental Protection Agency finally establishing a national drinking water standard for PFAS (per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances) chemicals,\\\" said Congressman Fitzpatrick. \\\"Since first arriving to Congress, I have called for a standard to restrict the levels of these dangerous 'forever chemicals' in our communities\\u2019 drinking water and advocated for long-term health studies to understand the health impacts of PFAS \\u2013 especially in the former Naval Air Warfare Center and Horsham Air Guard Station in my district.\\u00a0This final rule is another critical step in the right direction in protecting the American people from PFAS exposure and related health complications.\\u00a0Our work is far from complete. I look forward to continuing to advocate for federal investments in research and remediation efforts that will ensure that water sources are clean and safe for generations to come.\\\" Permalink:

I wanted to share an update on the work I did this week while back home in our district. On Monday, I celebrated Earth Day by taking a bike ride through Arlington Heights. In March, I secured $480,000 to allow the Village of Arlington Heights to build a safe and accessible walk and bike path connecting the Palatine Trail with the Prospect Heights Trail. This connectivity will allow people to easily access destinations without the use of cars, providing them with vital physical activity and reducing their carbon footprint. Earth Day is a time to celebrate the incredible planet we live on and fight for its future. It is also reminder that the climate crisis isn't just a challenge \\u2014 it's an opportunity to make investments in a cleaner future. Efforts like these are essential to encouraging people to reduce their reliance on gas powered transit, and transition to more efficient, environmentally friendly alternatives. On Thursday, I held my annual LGBTQIA+ roundtable, which hosts activists from across the Chicagoland area. It is an important chance to discuss the current state of LGBTQIA+ affairs and share some of the work I am doing to expand opportunities and strengthen protections for the LGBTQIA+ community. The event was moderated by Center on Halsted's CEO, Joli Robinson. On Thursday night, I viewed the many incredible Congressional Art Competition submissions from Illinois' 5th district. Polina Popandopulo, a student from Ridgewood High School, was declared the winner for their submission, \\\"Best Buddies Down on the Farm.\\\" This piece, along with the other winning submissions from congressional districts around the country, will hang in the U.S. Capitol for the next year. Every spring, the Congressional Art Competition is an opportunity to appreciate the rich artistic talent of the young people in my district. This year\\u2019s competition was no different. From oil on canvas to photography to scratchboard\\u2014 I was incredibly impressed by the potential on display. I am happy to congratulate Polina on their fine work. It will be a wonderful representation of our district's talent for the thousands of visitors to our Capitol from around the world. Don't forget, our office is always here to help. You can call my DC office at (202) 225-4061 or my Chicago office at (773) 267-5926. You can also email me through my website at Quigley.house.gov/contact.

Clarke (D-NY) led a letter to House Ways and Means Committee leadership emphasizing support for the early renewal of the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement (HOPE) and the Haiti Economic Lift Program (HELP) Acts, commonly known as HOPE/HELP. The HOPE/HELP program allows duty-free access for certain apparel and textile products from Haiti to the U.S. market. \\u201cNow more than ever is the time to help stabilize Haiti and save lives \\u2013 that includes supporting its economic growth and critical trade sectors,\\u201d said Congresswoman Pressley. \\u201cThe Haitian people have suffered deeply and to allow HOPE/HELP to expire would be a drastic disservice to their livelihood. I am proud to join my fellow co-chairs in calling for the reauthorization of these vital programs and preserving our longstanding trade partnership with our Haitian neighbors.\\u201d \\u201cHOPE/HELP plays a critical role in driving economic expansion in Haiti\\u2019s garment industry and fostering employment in the country,\\u201d said Congresswoman Cherfilus-McCormick. \\u201cIn these uncertain times for Haiti, it is imperative that we uphold and continue this vital program to ensure Haiti\\u2019s continued economic progress and stability.\\u201d \\u201cWith the ongoing security crisis confronting Haiti, it is critical Haiti\\u2019s economy has the support needed to endure this challenging period in its history. Make no mistake \\u2013 the swift renewal of HOPE/HELP is essential for Haiti\\u2019s post-crisis recovery and the future of its communities,\\u201d said Congresswoman Clarke. \\u201cAllowing Haiti\\u2019s apparel industry to lose necessary support in this moment of uncertainty would only serve to pull the rug out from under Haiti\\u2019s economy and instill further hardship on a nation that has already suffered dearly. Haiti and its people remain cherished allies of the United States, and that is why I am proud to stand with my fellow Co-Chairs of the Haiti Caucus to call for the continued funding of these vital programs.\\u201d HOPE/HELP is due to expire in September 2025, a little over a year from now.\\u00a0 As a result of these programs, apparel exports have grown to over $1 billion, representing over 80% of Haiti\\u2019s total exports. While the security crisis has justifiably received the most attention, the House Haiti Caucus recognizes the essential importance of maintaining Haiti\\u2019s formal economy.\\u00a0 Immediate reauthorization of HOPE/HELP ranks as one of the top policy priorities that the United States can do to help Haiti at this moment in time.\\u00a0 Additional signatories of the letter include Reps. Alma Adams (D-NC), Mario Diaz-Balart (R-FL), Gerald Connolly (D-VA), Adriano Espaillat (D-NY), Maxwell Alejandro Frost (D-FL), Dan Goldman (D-NY), Jonathan Jackson (D-IL), Sydney Kamlager-Dove (D-CA), Barbara Lee (D-CA), Michael Lawler (R-NY), Andre Carson (D-IN).
