May 8,Kevin McCarthy,R,Calif.-20,Speaker Johnson: Americans Should Decide American Elections,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE | Contact: Olivia Porcaro 202-225-6165 Over the past few months, we have watched violent, antisemitic, un-American, and pro-terrorist mobs take over college campuses across the country, endangering Jewish students and other innocent bystanders. Yet, for months, many Democrats have refused to speak out against the protests.  Sadly, this is no surprise. Antisemitism is a disease that the Far-Left, along with liberal university leaders, has allowed to spread.  In fact, over the past year, we have watched Democrats spread anti-Israel rhetoric time and time again. Some have called for Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to be replaced, one said it was an “honor” to visit with the pro-Hamas protestors at Columbia University, one defended the phrase “from the river to the sea”, which implies the destruction of Israel, one denounced Israel as a “racist state,” and more.  In addition, Far-Left Democrats in the House of Representatives have repeatedly voted against legislation supporting Israel. Back in October, immediately following Hamas’ barbaric October 7th attack on Israel, nine Democrats voted against a resolution to stand with Israel as it defended itself from the terrorist group. Then, again, just a few weeks ago, thirteen Democrats voted against condemning Iran’s missile attack on Israel.  The recent actions of the Democrats with respect to Israel are both outrageous and inappropriate. They truly seem to have lost all sense of moral and political clarity and have made it very clear - the Far-Left has a serious anti-Israel problem.  I couldn’t disagree with their views of Israel more.  Israel is our closest friend and ally in the Middle East, and the only democracy in the region. They are under assault by Iran, the largest state sponsor of terrorism and a deadly enemy to both Israel and the United States, and Hamas, a terrorist group who not only ruthlessly murdered over 1,200 Israelis on October 7, 2023, but also still holds over one hundred hostages, including five Americans.  These attacks on Israel are defining moments. Yet, instead of leading through strength and proving to the rest of the world that the United States remains steadfast in our commitment to Israel’s security, many Democrats have publicly criticized our democratic ally. This is both unthinkable and unprecedented, as their actions are driving a rift between the United States and its closest ally, playing into the objectives of the terrorists.   Although I have no faith that they will, I am calling on all of them, as well as the morally bankrupt university leaders who are allowing pro-terrorist protests on their campuses, to stand with our great ally, Israel, at this critical moment.   As the Leader of the Free World, we must support our allies, work together, and lead through with strength. To do anything else is a public betrayal to our friends in Israel and effectively supports an enemy to civilized people around the world. E-mail Me"

May 6,Tom Cole,R,Okla.-4,The Far-Lefts Serious Anti-Israel Problem,"May is Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) Heritage Month. I’m honored to join communities across the country in celebrating the history, immeasurable contributions, and achievements of the Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander communities. 
 
This observance originally began as “Asian/Pacific American Heritage Week,” which was established through a joint Congressional resolution in 1978 and was later designated as “Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month” in section 102 of title 36, United States Code. The month of May was chosen due to two important milestones in AANHPI history: May 7, 1843, when the first Japanese immigrants arrived in the United States, and May 10, 1869, when the first transcontinental railroad was completed with substantial contributions from Chinese immigrant workers.
 
AANHPI Month is about paying tribute to the generations of Asian and Pacific Islanders who have enriched America's history and are instrumental in our future success. We must also do all we can to stop anti-Asian hate, whenever and wherever it occurs. A new report shows 32% of Asian Americans nationwide were called a slur over the past 12 months, and 29% were verbally harassed or abused. More than a quarter of Asian Americans say they feel unsafe on public transportation, and 41% think they will be the victim of a physical attack in the next five years. 
 
Awareness is key – we need to do more to keep all Americans safe from bigotry and discrimination. One of the best ways to fight ignorance and hatred is by learning about other communities and cultures.  That’s why this month is so important. It gives us the  opportunity to learn more about our neighbors and their contributions to our country. Let’s make sure AANHPI stories are told at every level and AANHPI voices are represented – in books, media, entertainment, and in government.    Are you part of the AANHPI community? How are you celebrating this month, and what do you want the public to know about your community? Click to take my survey 
 BREAKING: Economy Update
 
The unemployment rate has been under 4% for the longest stretch of time since the 1960s. The U.S. added 175,000 new jobs last month. This is progress – but we have more to do, we must continue to make sure these jobs pay a livable minimum wage. 
 
That’s why I’m proud to support the Raise the Wage Act to increase the minimum wage to $17 an hour by 2028. Americans deserve to be fairly compensated for their hard work. Hoosiers shouldn’t have to work two or three jobs to feed their families or keep their homes.    That’s why I’m also working to lower the high cost of goods and services. Democrats’ work has resulted in a cap on the price of insulin – no senior on Medicare pays more than $35 a month for this lifesaving medication, thanks to our work. I’ll keep fighting for you – the hardworking, middle-class Americans who make our country so great. 
 Success Story of the Week:  
Last month, my office was honored to present Clifton Morlan of American Legion Post 360 with his official Korean Defense Medal. Our office began assisting Cliff with his medal request back in 2022. He was originally issued the discontinued Korean Service Medal instead of the correct Korean Defense Medal.  We were proud to get the correct medal awarded and honor a worthy veteran for his brave service to our country.    
If you or a family member needs assistance with veterans or other federal benefits, please contact my office! Team Carson is Here to Serve:  Did you know that in 2023, my office responded to over 70,000 of your messages and brought $1.5 MILLION directly back to Indianapolis families? Team Carson is here to serve you – get in touch to find out how we can help you navigate a federal agency, access government benefits, or recognize a community member’s milestone.  For updates throughout the week, don’t forget to follow me on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.

May 6,Gus Bilirakis,R,Fla.-12,Financial Disclosure Pasco County Utilities Project,"""It is unconscionable that President Biden is holding up the arms shipment to Israel. It shows a clear lack of understanding of the situation on the ground and the threat Hamas poses to Israel. Having recently been in the 'Gaza envelope' and talked to victims of the heinous Hamas October 7th attacks, and knowing that Hamas shelled Israel since 2007, it is clear that Hamas must be eliminated. Hamas has substantial military assets, troops and munitions, inside Rafah that Israel for self-defense reasons must neutralize. Israel has taken steps to try to alleviate harm to civilians and other noncombatants, and stands ready to assist with rebuilding a peaceful Gaza once Hamas is eliminated. For the life of me, I cannot understand why any supporter of the state of Israel could support the President’s actions."" Enter your email address to get the latest updates straight to your inbox.

May 6,Gus Bilirakis,R,Fla.-12,Hernando County Sewer Notice of Financial Disclosure,"May 8, 2024 Lawmakers Continue Calls for Extending TPS for Haiti, Halting Deportations, Disrupting Arms Trafficking, Providing Humanitarian & Economic Assistance, and More Press Conference (Twitter) | Photos (Dropbox) WASHINGTON – Haiti Caucus Co-Chairs Congresswomen Ayanna Pressley (MA-07), Yvette D. Clarke (NY-09) and Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick (FL-20), along with Congresswoman Cori Bush (MO-01), Congresswoman Frederica Wilson (FL-24), and Congresswoman Barbara Lee (CA-13), held a Capitol Hill press conference with colleagues and advocates to renew their calls for urgent federal action to address the growing crisis in Haiti. The press conference comes at a time when the humanitarian, political, economic, and security crises in Haiti are becoming increasingly dire.  The policies called for by the lawmakers and advocates include: extending and redesignating TPS for Haiti; halting all deportations to Haiti; disrupting arms trafficking to the island; providing urgent humanitarian relief; preventing the transfer of Haitian nationals to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; passing a new economic assistance package that creates jobs and rebuilds Haiti’s infrastructure; facilitating the establishment of a representative transitional government led by Haitian civil society; and more. “Our Haitian siblings on the island and throughout the diaspora should know that we have not forgotten them and we will never stop fighting for the just and equitable future the Haitian people need and deserve,” said Congresswoman Pressley, Co-Chair of the House Haiti Caucus. “Congress and the Biden Administration have a moral obligation to take action to stabilize Haiti and to save lives, including by providing humanitarian and economic assistance, extending TPS for Haiti, halting deportations, supporting a democratic transition led by Haitian civil society, and more. If we truly believe Black lives matter, then that must include Haitian lives.” “Our nation owes a debt to Haiti. Repayment begins by helping ensure that a Haitian-led democracy rings true in their communities, in the United States, and across the globe. We must take every action necessary to secure a democratic transition led by Haiti’s civil society, and that includes providing vital humanitarian and economic aid, expediting visa processing, cracking down on illegal arms trafficking, and extending TPS and halting deportations. Congress has a responsibility to support Haitian stability and the safety of all its people, and it holds the power to deliver the progress our Haitian neighbors at home and abroad are counting on. In this dire moment where the future of our beloved Caribbean ally is at risk and millions of lives remain imperiled, inaction is inexcusable,” said Congresswoman Yvette D. Clarke, Co-Chair of the House Haiti Caucus. “In the face of the crisis in Haiti, our moral compass and international duty compel us to step forward, not just to alleviate the immediate suffering of the Haitian people, but to address the systemic problems forcing Haitians to flee their homeland. The extension and re-designation of Temporary Protected Status (TPS), alongside an expedited parole program and an immediate halt to deportations, are critical first steps. But our responsibility does not end there. We must confront the root causes of migration by: (1) ensuring that Haitians can live safely and peacefully within their own borders; (2) taking a firm stand against the trafficking of firearms from places like Florida to Haiti; (3) holding those who perpetuate violence and instability accountable,” said Congresswoman Sheila Cherfilus McCormick, Co-Chair of the House Haiti Caucus. “As a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I have a pulse on the challenges facing our allies around the world. Just as we have extended our support to them during their time of need, Haiti deserves the same treatment. The time for action is now – to protect lives, foster security, and promote stability where Haitians can thrive in their own country.” “To deport people back to Haiti is a cause and kiss of death,” said Congresswoman Frederica Wilson. “There is nothing in Haiti but suffering, so we have to say to the President of the United States, ‘Stop the deportation.’ Not only expand TPS but stop the deportation and support the new government that we are putting together in Haiti. This government is being supported by the international community, the United States government, and the Caribbean community; it is Haitian-led. We must fund them—fund them just as we do other countries. Fund them! Fund them just like you fund other countries.” The lawmakers were joined by Guerline Jozef, Executive Director of Haitian Bridge Alliance, Patrice Lawrence, Executive Director of UndocuBlack Network, Mary Estimé-Irvin, Chairwoman of National Haitian American Elected Officials Network, Tessa Petit, Executive Director of Florida Immigrant Coalition, and impacted families and TPS recipients. “It’s urgent for President Biden to re-designate and extend TPS for Haiti,” said Guerline Jozef, Co-Founder and Executive Director, Haitian Bridge Alliance. “Equally vital is for the United States Congress to pass an economic package supporting job creation and key infrastructure projects. Additionally, the Biden administration must immediately cease the deportation of Haitian nationals. Sending people to a country plagued by insecurity and humanitarian crises is  unconscionable. The disparate treatment of Black immigrants must come to an end!” “UndocuBlack Network calls on the Biden- Harris administration to end the cruelty against Haitians. It is cruel to deport Haitian nationals while arranging for evacuation of American nationals at the same time. Our ask is simple, honor the dignity of Haitian people. If Secretary Mayorkas leads by these values, he will release Haitians from detention, extend and redesignate TPS for Haiti and stop the deportations now. To be the change President Biden claimed to be, he must act differently from his predecessors especially as it relates to Black immigrants,” said Patrice Lawrence, Executive Director, UndocuBlack Network. “The painful reality of the Haitian people is complex and multi-layered.  However, the immediate steps that need to be taken can happen with the stroke of a pen. It is time for the Administration to redesignate and extend TPS for Haiti. It is also crucial that all deportation of Haitians be immediately halted,” said Tessa Petit, Executive Director, Florida Immigrant Coalition. “Haitians need security, justice, understanding and acceptance.  That will only be possible with the will from the administration to support Haiti by addressing its root causes, through a comprehensive humanitarian and economic support that will change the future of the Haitian people.” “An economic plan akin to the Marshall Plan is essential to aid Haiti, which is located less than 90 miles from our shores, in addition to humanitarian assistance and the reconsideration of TPS,” said Mary Estimé-Irvin, Chairwoman, National Haitian American Elected Officials Network. “Like Israel, Ukraine, and Taiwan, Haiti is a sovereign nation that requires support.” Footage from the press conference can be found here, and photos can be found here. As Representative for the Massachusetts 7th Congressional District, Congresswoman Pressley serves as Co-Chair for the House Haiti Caucus and represents one of the largest Haitian diaspora communities in the country, with approximately 46,000 Haitians and Haitian-Americans living across the state and over half in the Boston metropolitan area. Additionally, Massachusetts is home to more than 4,700 Haitians with Temporary Protected Status. ### Washington DC Office 402 Cannon HOB

May 6,Gus Bilirakis,R,Fla.-12,Crystal River Wastewater Project Financial Disclosure,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, Representative Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.-07), along with U.S. Senators Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, and Border Safety, Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), and Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), and Representative Nanette Barragán (D-Calif.-44), joined advocates from FWD.us, American Families United, UnidosUS, CASA, and others to call on President Biden to protect long-term undocumented immigrants in the United States. The members and advocates urged the Biden Administration to take urgent action, reportedly under consideration, to provide protections and relief for long-term undocumented individuals, including people who have been in the United States for decades, contributing in countless ways to our communities. Specifically, they called on President Biden to expand Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and to streamline pathways to lawful status for undocumented spouses of U.S. citizens, family caregivers, and other long-term residents. Padilla, Durbin, Booker, Cortez Masto, Luján, and Markey previously provided their recommendations to the Administration for executive actions to streamline immigration relief for the undocumented population and DACA recipients in the United States. “As the Biden Administration considers executive actions on immigration, we must not return to failed Trump-era policies aimed at banning asylum and moving us backwards,” said Senator Padilla. “I urge President Biden to embrace our values as a nation of immigrants and use this opportunity to instead provide relief for the long-term immigrants of this nation.” “Our hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee made clear: Dreamers are American in every way but their paperwork. They contribute to our economy and are foundational to our communities. While Republicans peddle extremist anti-immigrant rhetoric and block bipartisan reform, we need solutions now. That’s why I’m urging President Biden to use his executive authority to provide relief for long-term undocumented immigrants and ensure that families can stay together and live free of fear of deportation,” said Senator Durbin. “I’m proud to stand with advocates and my fellow legislators to reaffirm our commitment to protecting undocumented people, many of whom have been a part of our nation for decades,” said Senator Booker. “These Americans and their families remain ensnared in a dysfunctional system that offers them no path to lawful status. We call on President Biden to take decisive executive action now to provide relief to millions of people and safeguard American families at risk of being torn apart.” “There are hundreds of thousands of Nevadans who live with at least one family member who is an undocumented, long-term resident of the U.S. The President must help protect these hardworking families through executive action so they don’t pay the price for Republicans’ political games,” said Senator Cortez Masto. “The time to act is now, and I’ll keep fighting to fix our immigration system and strengthen our border security—we have to do both.” “There are thousands of immigrants who risked their life to travel to America for a better life. They’ve built lives here, and are now part of the fabric of this nation. They are deserving of a dignified path to citizenship. Both Democrats and Republicans know it’s time for us to fix our broken immigration system,” said Senator Luján. “I urge President Biden to continue working to solve our immigration challenges for our brothers and sisters who already call America home.” “With millions of undocumented immigrants currently living in fear of separation from their families, we need a more streamlined process for undocumented immigrant spouses of U.S. citizens, family caregivers, and other long-term residents to move through administrative obstacles. I will continue to advocate on behalf of DACA recipients and immigrants across this country for an immigration system that prioritizes fairness, humanity, and hope,” said Senator Markey. “President Biden should seize this critical moment by exercising his Executive Authority to rebuild our broken immigration system. We urge him to provide pathways to citizenship and protections for the millions of long-term undocumented residents who have contributed to the rich fabric of the United States,” said Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chair Nanette Barragán. “These are our uncles, aunts, parents, friends, and loved ones, who have raised their own families right here in our neighborhoods. They call America their permanent home, they deserve the chance to come out of the shadows.” “I am proud to be an immigrant, one of just two dozen naturalized citizens to serve in the United States Congress. I know—and the vast majority of the American people know—that America is fueled by the creativity, inspiration and hard work of immigrant families. Harsh, enforcement-only policies that separate families have never worked and will not work. In the meantime, the Biden Administration’s greatest successes have been in using its legal authority to provide more legal pathways through the kinds of actions we are advocating for today. We can boost our economy, enrich our communities, and actually make life better for America families across this country,” said Representative Jayapal. “Immigration relief would be a win-win for immigrant families and our nation. If given access to legal status and work permits, the long-residing undocumented would fill gaps in our workforce, increase productivity, and fuel economic growth,” said Janet Murguía, President and CEO of UnidosUS. “Polls consistently show Americans support relief for the undocumented and it’s the #1 immigration priority of Latino voters. We urge President Biden to act to protect immigrants in American families and with deep roots in the U.S., and we’ll work tirelessly to ensure immigrants sign up for the protection, so they contribute even more to our society, tax base and the economy.” “I know first hand what life in this country is as an undocumented immigrant. I also know the transformational impact of affirmative relief, and the significance of adjusting from temporary status to permanent residence. So I’m here today to urge President Biden in the strongest possible terms to provide affirmative relief via executive action. He could offer legal pathways that would allow as many of 3 million people, including Dreamers, daily caregivers, and other long-settled immigrants to continue working and contributing to their families and communities,” said Maria Praeli, Deputy Director of Government Relations & Coalitions, FWD.us. “DACA has been a lifeline for me, but thousands of DACA recipients like me could also benefit from parole in place – allowing us to adjust our status without having to leave the only country we know as home,” said Foday Turay, a DACA recipient, Assistant District Attorney for Pennsylvania, and an American Families United member. “I want to say directly to President Biden: please grant affirmative relief to protect American families like mine. Parole in place would be a beacon of hope for my family — an answered prayer that would allow me to continue to work as an attorney, contributing to my community by doing what I love. Most importantly, it would provide long-overdue relief to my son and wife, who would no longer have to worry that daddy could be taken away.” “Doing what we thought we needed to do to live our American Dream has become our nightmare. Our family was forced to separate. Our U.S. born children were forced to leave their country to be closer to their mother, and I’ve been living apart from my family for 2 years — our entire family’s mental health, my children’s opportunities, have all been deeply hurt by this separation,” said Gerardo Diaz, a U.S. citizen and an American Families United member who has had to live apart from his family for more than 2 years already. “Two years of not kissing my kids goodnight before they go to sleep and missing out on endless milestones in their young lives. President Biden, please listen to us: we know that you can use your authority to protect and reunite American families like mine. We’ve already seen you reunite families — and there are many more of us who need relief urgently, right now.”

Mayor Muriel Bowser finally stopped restricting law enforcement from restoring order at George Washington University, just hours ahead of her scheduled testimony before the House Oversight Committee.Because the encampments were cleaned up and order was restored on campus, the Committee canceled the scheduled hearing.   “Last week, we announced a House-wide crackdown on antisemitism on college campuses,” said Speaker Johnson. “This week, Chairman Comer and the Oversight Committee delivered results by compelling Mayor Bowser to order police to clear the weeks-long, pro-Hamas and illegal encampments around George Washington University’s campus.   “While it should not require threatening to haul D.C.’s mayor before Congress to keep Jewish students at George Washington University safe, I applaud Chairman Comer’s steadfast leadership.   “Through the House-wide effort to crack down on antisemitism, we are going to learn why security forces and campus administrators have refused to do their first job: keeping students safe.”   ###

May 6,Gus Bilirakis,R,Fla.-12,City of Inverness Project Financial Disclosure,"Ever since Hamas unleashed itself on Israel in October, far-left Democrats and corrupt university leaders have allowed antisemitism to overrun America's once great higher education institutions. All law and order and academic integrity have been thrown out the window as elitist, pro-Hamas student protest groups continue setting up 'Gaza Solidarity' encampments at their schools to protest Israel's right to protect itself from terrorism. In some states, law enforcement has acted swiftly to shut down the mobs; in others, university leaders have protected the protesters, allowing them to continue their hateful demonstrations. The First Amendment protects Americans' rights to assemble and express our views through peaceful protest. It does not, however, protect entitled students who try to wrongfully evoke those rights through aggressive protests promoting terrorism.  The scenes from these protests are downright despicable. Protesters are ransacking academic buildings, they're blocking anyone who refuses to condemn Israel from attending class, and Jewish students no longer feel safe to walk through campus. Enough is enough. Antisemitism has no place in America, especially at our colleges and universities. We must bring back moral decency to our higher education institutions. House Republicans, under the leadership of Speaker Mike Johnson, have launched a House-wide probe into campus antisemitism. This probe will not stop until Jewish students can feel safe again on campus and those who have been compliant in this hatred are held accountable. This week, as part of that effort, I voted to pass the Antisemitism Awareness Act, bipartisan legislation that will be a critical step in taking action to protect Jewish students nationwide. Our Jewish brothers and sisters are looking to us to stand up against hatred. I will continue to work with my House Republican colleagues to lead in this effort where university presidents and far-left Democrats have failed."
May 8,André Carson,D,Ind.-7,Happy AANHPI Month!,"Washington, DC – Today, Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries spoke on the House Floor in opposition to the Hands Off Our Home Appliances Act. He emphasized that while extreme MAGA Republicans are focused on liberty for laundry and dignity for dishwashers, House Democrats are fighting for lower costs, safer communities and reproductive freedom.  LEADER JEFFRIES: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you to the distinguished gentleman from the great state of New Jersey for yielding and for his tremendous leadership.The House of Representatives, of course, is the institution the framers designed to be the closest to the American people, the first institution mentioned in the United States Constitution, the People’s House, the place where President Abraham Lincoln declared that America is the last best hope of Earth, the place where FDR made clear the importance of defending democracy against the tyranny of Nazi fascism. It’s the place where President Lyndon Baines Johnson talked about the importance of the Voting Rights Act, and made clear to America that we shall overcome.The House of Representatives is a special place. And so earlier today I was told you need to get to the House Floor to deal with the signature piece of legislation from the extreme MAGA Republicans in this 118th Congress. And so, I wondered to myself, is it going to be about inflation, lower costs, housing affordability, public safety, dealing with the challenges at the border, Social Security, Medicare, what is it going to be about? And it turns out the signature piece of legislation for the extreme MAGA Republicans this week, this month, this year is Hands Off Our Home Appliances Act. This is what we are dealing with? On this magical House Floor, with all of the challenges that the American people are confronting. Liberty for laundry? Defending the dignity of dishwashers? Fighting for freedom of refrigerators? This is what we’re doing? You can’t make it up. You can’t make it up.As House Democrats, we are going to defend democracy. Extreme MAGA Republicans are working on defending the dignity of dishwashers. As House Democrats, we are going to protect and strengthen Social Security. Extreme MAGA Republicans are apparently interested in protecting gas stoves against phony accusations of oppression. House Democrats are going to defend reproductive freedom. Extreme MAGA Republicans focus on the freedom for refrigerators. We believe in a woman’s freedom to make her own reproductive healthcare decisions. Period. Full stop. And women’s health care and protecting the women of America against extreme MAGA Republican overreach. And instead of leaning into the protection of reproductive freedom, instead of trying to strengthen Social Security and Medicare, you want to criminalize abortion care. You want to impose a nationwide ban and then waste time on the House Floor as it relates to the liberty of laundry. You can’t make this up.And so, I just urge my Republican colleagues to partner with us. If you want to push back against overreach, push back against the pro-Putin, extreme overreach on your side of the aisle that doesn’t want to defend democracy and freedom here and abroad. It’s undermining it. And we extend the hand of partnership, as we’ve repeatedly done, to solve real problems for the American people. But those problems have nothing to do with the dignity of dishwashers, the freedom of refrigerators or the liberty of laundry. Let’s get back to doing the real business of the American people. Vote no against this legislation. Full speech can be watched here. ### Subscribe to our e-newsletter that provides updates

May 8,Morgan Griffith,R,Va.-9,Griffith Statement on President Biden Pause on Israel Arms Shipment,"Washington, DC – Today, Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries delivered remarks at the Holocaust Days of Remembrance ceremony to honor the survivors, remember the victims and make clear our commitment to fighting antisemitism in all its forms.  Leader Jeffries: President Biden, Speaker Johnson, Speaker Emerita Pelosi, Ambassador Eizenstat, Director Bloomfield, all of my colleagues in Congress, honorable ambassadors. To Frank, Abe, Manny, Rae, Alfred, all those survivors whose lives we honor and to all those assembled for this incredibly important event, thank you for your presence here today.Let me begin by making clear our commitment to doing everything that we can, with the positions of authority that we have, in the times when it matters the most, to ensure that never again, unequivocally, means never again.More than 40 years ago, Congress established the Days of Remembrance and enshrined into law the moral necessity to gather in commemoration of the 6 million Jews who were brutally murdered during the Shoah.Holocaust survivor, author and noted humanitarian, Elie Wiesel, when accepting his Nobel Peace Prize in 1986, said that “action is the only remedy to indifference” and he made clear that indifference is “the most insidious danger of all.”This is a day for remembrance and action. A day to honor the memory of all those murdered by the evil Nazi regime. It’s a day to honor the Holocaust survivors, like Eva Cooper from New York City, and so many others who endured and escaped unconscionable atrocities. It’s a day to recommit to the struggle against indifference. As the El Maleh Rahamim prayer that will be heard today so beautifully and hauntingly pleads, we gather to ask God to protect and elevate the souls of those taken from our world too soon.We are also here exactly seven months to the day of the horrific atrocities committed by Hamas on 10/7, the largest loss of Jewish life on a single day since the Holocaust. There are families whose loved ones were slaughtered. There are hostages still being held in horrific conditions.And we are witnessing a deeply disturbing rise in antisemitism on campuses throughout the country and in the world. This is a very searing time for the Jewish community. Systematic oppression has been a reality of Jewish life for thousands of years, having to endure expulsions, pain, pogroms, persecution, prejudice and the horrors of the Holocaust, a previously unthinkable crime against humanity.Last Sabbath, Jewish communities across the world read the Torah portion which followed the tragic deaths of Aaron’s two sons, Nadav and Avihu. During this moment of great vulnerability, Aaron receives instructions from God that he, as the High Priest, must carry out during the Yom Kippur service.We learned from God and Aaron that Jewish life, practice and community must continue in the face of horrific tragedy. Aaron embodies what it means to be resilient when confronting immense pain. Today, in partnership with the Jewish community, we recommit to carrying on with strength and resilience. We recommit to the remembrance of the Holocaust. We recommit to the principle of never again. And we recommit to eradicating antisemitism whenever and wherever it rears its ugly head.As we lift up the spirit and memory of all who perished during the Holocaust and honor the survivors with us today, let us always place irreversible determination over indifference. The effort to combat antisemitism is not a Democratic issue or a Republican issue, it’s an American issue. We must crush antisemitism – along with racism, sexism, Islamophobia, xenophobia, homophobia and all other forms of hatred – together.That’s the American way – together. And together, we will defeat antisemitism with the fierce urgency of now. That’s a moral necessity.God bless each and every one of you. God bless the survivors. May God bless the United States of America.Full remarks are available here.   ### Subscribe to our e-newsletter that provides updates

May 8,Hakeem Jeffries,D,N.Y.-8,LEADER JEFFRIES STATEMENTON FAILED MAGA REPUBLICAN MOTION TO VACATE,"            At a congressional hearing chaired by Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ) today, two renowned journalists and a top tech executive shared extensive evidence of widespread censorship and persecution in Brazil used to stifle opposition to President Lula, raising alarming concerns over the future of democracy and rule of law in the largest country in Latin America.             “Since late 2022, Brazilians have been subject to human rights violations committed by Brazilian officials on a large scale,” said Rep. Smith, the Chairman of the House Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations Subcommittee.             “Friends don’t let friends commit human rights abuses,” said Smith. “The Government of Brazil has pursued Brazilian journalists and even people it considers to be political opponents in the United States. It has used Interpol Red Notices, social intimidation, threats of legal action and extradition, and according to one credible victim of its transnational repression, has sought to use the FBI as a carrier or conduit of its intimidation.”             In addition to Rumble Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Chris Pavlovski, Smith’s hearing featured testimony from two renowned journalists, including Michael Shellenberger—who documents the systematic, far-reaching efforts of Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes to ban and punish political opponents of the Lula government—and prominent Brazilian journalist Paulo Figueiredo.


             “Today, Brazil is no longer a liberal democracy,” said Shellenberger. “It is an illiberal one where people fear speaking their minds for fear of punishment…The censorship in Brazil is the worst I have seen in any Western democracy.”             Figueiredo shared his harrowing personal account of abuses by the Brazilian government, which locked him from all social network platforms—including YouTube and X (Twitter)—froze his assets, and subjected him to exorbitant fines.             “On December 30, 2022, therefore 2 months after Lula's victorious election, I felt the full force of this repression,” said Figueiredo, who was on vacation with his family when he received a call from an acquaintance at a social media company. “She warned me that they had received an order from Alexandre de Moraes himself determining that my networks should be blocked for Brazilians within a maximum of two hours, under penalty of severe fines in case of non-compliance. And that all social network platforms had received the same order.”             “I would disappear for my entire audience,” Figueiredo said. “This is the modern equivalent of being sent to a dungeon.”             Rumble CEO Chris Pavlovski shared details surrounding the requests he received from the Brazilian government to remove individuals from the platform, even though they did not violate Rumble’s terms and conditions. Instead of complying with the government’s orders, Rumble chose to disable access for users in Brazil while challenging the legality of the demands.             “Today it is Rumble, yesterday it was X, but tomorrow it could be the New York Times,” Pavlovski said. “The platform shouldn’t matter; the universal right to freedom of speech and expression—the core of Western democracy—is at stake. America needs to step up and take a leading role.”             Smith, who chaired a historic hearing in 2006 on the complicity of Yahoo, Google, Microsoft, and Cisco in China’s regime of internet censorship and surveillance, noted how Elon Musk has now become a target of the Brazilian government for refusing to comply with what Musk said was “aggressive censorship” that “appears to violate the law and will of the people of Brazil.”             “Confirming everything Paulo, and Michael Shellenberger have been saying about Brazil, Alexandre de Moraes added Musk to his ‘fake news’ investigation, and opened an inquiry on Musk for what he called an obstruction of justice,” Smith said.             “Free speech and media freedom are becoming two of the most important human rights issues of our time,” said Smith. “Without freedoms of expression, we are unable to defend against any other human rights abuses.” ### Chris has three offices dedicated to constituent services.

May 8,Kevin McCarthy,R,Calif.-20,Speaker Johnson Releases Video for Holocaust Days of Remembrance,"Nearly fifteen years ago, I introduced a House resolution recognizing the Winston Churchill Memorial and Library on the campus of Westminster College in Fulton, as America’s National Churchill Museum. I was excited for the opportunity to recognize this history right here in central Missouri. Last week, I had the pleasure of revisiting the campus and museum to engage in conversations with current students and staff. This was truly a full circle moment as I returned to the very place I visited as a freshman member of Congress more than a decade ago.  In 1946, Winston Churchill delivered his famous “Iron Curtain Speech” on campus. Churchill was an instrumental figure in bringing an end to World War II and displayed resounding dedication to protecting liberty for all people.  As one of the greatest figures of the 20th Century, Sir Winston Churchill, a man with a literary bent and a deep devotion to public affairs; remains a political icon to many, even in 2024. Churchill did not merely hate tyranny, he despised it. And he reviled communism. The contempt he breathed for dictators -- renewed in his Iron Curtain speech, at the outset of the cold war -- strengthened the West’s faith in the moral superiority of democracy and the inevitability of its triumph. And while much has changed since the times of the speech back in 1946, many of the core principles are still applicable. As Winston Churchill said, “Learn all you can about the history of the past, for how else can one even make a guess what is going to happen in the future.” A statement has never rung truer. At the time of his speech, the Cold War was at its height and the U.S. was actively combatting the spread of the red curtain. More than 75 years later, keeping communism out of our borders is still an uphill battle; we are just challenged with doing it in different ways. Our adversaries advance day by day infiltrating our communities, economy, and citizens’ lives. While history isn’t fully replicating itself, knowing and understanding the past has allowed us to prepare for the current day and how we can best assist our allies in their fight against mutual adversaries – I’ll save this deep dive for another day.  Throughout his life, Churchill had many incredible quotes. He once said, “We shape our buildings; thereafter they shape us”. On campus, one the many beautiful pieces of history you will find is the St. Mary the Virgin, Aldermanbury Church, which serves as the campus chapel. The church is a symbol for historical inspiration for many and is a sacred place of worship for students. In 1961, with the support from Winston Churchill himself, Westminster College President, Dr. Robert L.D. Davidson, wanted a unique way to memorialize Churchill’s contributions. After much thought and consultation from his peers, he decided to import a war-ravaged church from England. Yes, you read that correctly, he imported a church! Four years, many permissions, and thousands of bricks later, the St. Mary the Virgin, Aldermanbury Church was built and dedicated on campus. All of this to say, in rebuilding this beautiful structure, ravaged by war, and slated for demolition, it found a new purpose as it was rebuilt on the soil of Fulton, MO.  The St. Mary the Virgin, Aldermanbury Church is not just a place for worship, but a memorial of Winston Churchill – a man who had a nation’s best interest in mind.  
If you haven’t already, I recommend making a trip out to Fulton to see the Churchill Museum. Whether you find beauty in history, architecture, or being able to piece together Churchill’s thoughts through seeing actual papers, correspondence, and memorabilia; its time well spent, and I couldn’t be prouder it’s in the Third District of Missouri.

May 8,Ayanna Pressley,D,Mass.-7,"Pressley, Haiti Caucus, Colleagues, Advocates Renew Calls for Federal Action to Stabilize Haiti, Address Growing Crisis on the Island","Washington, DC – Today, Congresswoman Julia Brownley (D-CA) announced the introduction of the VA Marriage and Family Therapists Equity Act, legislation which would expand access to professional therapists for veterans and their families. Specifically, this bill would remove an onerous regulation that limits the practice of nearly half of all the Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists (LMFTs) employed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  Currently, VA hires LMFTs who are licensed through a variety of organizations, including the Commission on Accreditation for Marriage and Family Therapy Education (COAMFTE) program and the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy (AAMFT). On average, 30% of LMFTs do not graduate from COAMFTE programs across the nation, and in California that number rises to 95%. Despite these rates, VA’s current regulations state that only those licensed through COAMFTE may be promoted to supervisory positions. Given the limited pay and career development, this regulation discourages qualified LMFTs from wanting to work for VA.  “The current regulations for licensed marriage and family therapists at VA are overly rigorous and are not in line with industry standards, which results in nearly half of all the therapists at the VA to be extremely restricted,” said Congresswoman Brownley. “The varied needs of our nation’s veterans and their families must be addressed through the recruitment and retention of highly-qualified professionals. My bill ensures that VA can significantly expand veterans’ access to therapists and that the delivery of quality and timely care continues to be the standard, not the exception.”  “The VA hires licensed marriage and family therapists to serve as providers of essential behavioral health services to our Veterans,” said Christine Michaels, Chief Executive Officer of the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy. “However, VA policy significantly restricts the ability of these MFTs to be promoted to supervisory positions within the VA, a restriction which does nothing to improve care for Veterans while encouraging MFTs working for the VA to leave for other opportunities. This legislation will remove this restriction and encourage employee retention and continuity of care by allowing many more MFTs serving in the VA the opportunity to be promoted to supervisory positions.” “America’s veterans deserve timely access to mental health care, here in California and across our nation. CAMFT wants to thank Representative Brownley for authoring key legislation that will make it easier for more Marriage and Family Therapists to provide care within the VA system, reducing wait times for needed services and ensuring our veterans are supported,” said Joy Alafia Executive Director of the California Association of Marriage & Family Therapists. LMFTs assist individuals and couples through interpersonal conflicts, major life changes, and work to develop appropriate coping mechanisms for a variety of challenges. The unique challenges that our nation’s military and veteran families face need to be addressed through robust, wrap-around services, quality caretakers, and holistic treatment, regardless of location.  Read the full text of the VA Marriage and Family Therapists Equity Act, here. ###

Clarke (NY-09) and Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick (FL-20), led a group of 50 lawmakers urging the Biden Administration to redesignate Haiti for Temporary Protected Status (TPS), pause on deportations back to Haiti, extend humanitarian parole to any Haitians currently detained in Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s detention centers, end detention of Haitian migrants intercepted at sea, and provide additional humanitarian assistance for Haiti. “We urge the Administration to redesignate Haiti for Temporary Protected Status (TPS), halt deportations back to Haiti, and extend humanitarian parole to any Haitians currently detained in Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) detention centers. Additionally, we request your administration’s end to the detention of Haitian migrants who were interdicted at sea. The possibility of transferring them to Guantánamo Bay naval base and other offshore migrant detention centers is concerning and must not be explored.

May 8,Yvette D. Clarke,D,N.Y.-9,"CLARKE, HAITI CAUCUS, COLLEAGUES, ADVOCATES RENEW CALLS FOR FEDERAL ACTION TO STABILIZE HAITI, ADDRESS GROWING CRISIS ON THE ISLAND","            In a phone call with Rutgers President Jonathan Holloway today, Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ) raised his concerns over the University’s reply to the ten demands issued by the encampment organizers in order to end the antisemitic, anti-Israel, pro-Hamas protests on its New Brunswick campus.             “While we had a productive conversation, I continue to have deep concerns about Rutgers’ recent action given their egregious history of antisemitism and its failure to protect Jewish students,” said Smith.             “I look forward to engaging further with President Holloway including when he comes to testify before Congress later this month to provide needed insights and explanation as part of Congress’ aggressive investigation into antisemitism on college campuses,” Smith said.             Last week, Rutgers announced it had reached an agreement with protestors, responding to their list of demands that included orders to:             · “Divest from any firm or corporation materially participating in, benefitting from, or otherwise supporting the state of Israel’s settler colonialism, apartheid, and genocide of Palestine and the Palestinian people…”;             · “Terminate its partnership with Tel Aviv University…”;             · Give out scholarships to Gazan students with taxpayer funding; and             · “…release a statement from the Office of the President acknowledging the ongoing genocide against Palestinians….”             “Rutgers must absolutely commit to combat the antisemitic threats that have been escalating against Jewish students on campus,” said Smith.             A March letter informing the University of the congressional investigation notes that “Rutgers stands out for the intensity and pervasiveness of antisemitism on its campuses.” The letter, which Smith said reads more like an indictment, specifically states that “Rutgers-Newark’s Center for Security, Race and Rights (CSRR) has become notorious as a hotbed of radical antisemitic, anti-American, anti-Israel, and pro-terrorist activity.”             Smith said that Rutgers has submitted approximately 80,000 pages to date in response to the congressional investigation that remains underway but noted that the vast majority of them have not been illuminative thus far. ### Chris has three offices dedicated to constituent services.

May 8,Kevin McCarthy,R,Calif.-20,Speaker Johnson Commends House Oversight Committee for Forcing D.C. to Clear Pro-Hamas Encampments,"Brooklyn, NY – In case you missed it, Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries appeared on CBS 60 Minutes with Norah O’Donnell where he emphasized that House Democrats remain committed to supporting our allies, defending freedom and delivering results for hardworking American taxpayers, while extreme MAGA Republicans continue to bend the knee to Donald Trump.  Norah O’Donnell: The United States Congress is not particularly popular these days and look no further than the current session to understand why. It will likely be the least productive Congress since the Civil War. One lawmaker who’s figured out a way to get a few things done is Congressman Hakeem Jeffries. He replaced Nancy Pelosi as the leader of the Democrats in the House over a year ago and the 53-year-old has built a reputation as a consensus builder in his own Caucus and as a tough but respectful opponent of the Republican Party. Minority Leader Jeffries could potentially become the first Black Speaker of the House, though to hear him tell it, the Democrats are already in charge.  Leader Jeffries: Even though we’re in the minority, we effectively have been governing as if we were in the majority because we continue to provide a majority of the votes necessary to get things done. Those are just the facts.Norah O’Donnell: The fact is, Republicans in the House are a majority in name only. With just two votes to spare, infighting has crippled their Conference. Even some Republican members are at their wits’ end.Rep. Troy Nehls (R-Texas, on April 9): The Lord Jesus himself could not manage this Conference.Leader Jeffries: It’s a difficult situation on the other side of the aisle, because many of my Republican colleagues are more interested in creating chaos, dysfunction and extremism.Norah O’Donnell: For what purpose?Leader Jeffries: That’s a good question that has to be asked of them. We were sent by the American people, to get things done, to solve problems. At the end of the day, some people don’t have that view of the job.Norah O’Donnell: Nine months after getting the job of speaker, Republican Kevin McCarthy of California got dumped by the far-right wing of his party. Following three weeks of paralysis, Mike Johnson of Louisiana took his place. After he worked with Democrats to pass the foreign aid bill that included $61 billion for Ukraine, Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who opposed it, said she will follow through with a threat to oust him. Jeffries told us he works to find common ground with the other side of the aisle and at least one Republican who might be happy about that is Speaker Johnson. This past week Democrats said they would vote against Congresswoman Greene’s effort to remove him.Norah O’Donnell: Has Speaker Johnson asked for your help?Leader Jeffries: He has not. And our view would traditionally be, “Let the other side work its own mess out.” But when that mess starts to impact the ability to do the job on behalf of the American people, then the responsible thing at that moment might be for us to make clear that we will not allow the extremists to throw the Congress and the country into chaos.Norah O’Donnell: As chaos spreads across college campuses nationwide over Israel and Gaza, some far left members of Jeffries’ own party have shown support for protestors… Leader Jeffries, whose district is 11% Jewish, spoke about the protests at his weekly press conference this past Wednesday.Leader Jeffries (on May 1): Peaceful protest is an important part of the fabric of America but we shouldn’t see any protest ever veer into threatening the safety and security of others, into antisemitism, or racism or xenophobia.Norah O’Donnell: In all, 37 House Democrats recently voted against sending more military aid to Israel. The divisive issue will follow Leader Jeffries and President Biden into the election this November, where control of the White House and Congress looks like a coin flip.Norah O’Donnell: What do you think about how Israel has been waging this war against Hamas in Gaza?Leader Jeffries: Israel was put in a very difficult situation when it comes to the horrific events of 10/7– a brutal terrorist attack by Hamas, which is an entity that has sworn to wipe Israel off the face of the Earth. So Israel was in a position where of course it had to respond, to decisively defeat Hamas. At the same time, my view has been that we have to do everything possible to get the hostages out and to surge humanitarian assistance into Gaza. Norah O’Donnell: But isn’t it also true that while retaliating and going after Hamas terrorists, that Israel has been indiscriminate in its bombing?Leader Jeffries: I would not say that they’ve been indiscriminate. I do think what we’d like to see moving forward is the execution of the new phases of this conflict with surgical precision.Norah O’Donnell: You can still be a strong supporter of Israel and Americans’ defense of Israel and be critical of their approach, about how they waged this war in Gaza.Leader Jeffries: That’s correct.Norah O’Donnell: But you seem reluctant to criticize Israel at all.Hakeem Jeffries: I’m dealing with the facts– on the ground. Norah O’Donnell: The facts are there are – according to the UN – half of Gaza’s 2.2 million people are on the verge of famine. Ha– has Israel done enough to get food and aid into Gaza?Leader Jeffries: Israel clearly– needs to do more, as– as they have recently acknowledged through their actions to surge humanitarian assistance– into Gaza. The other thing that I think– is important–Norah O’Donnell: Only after they killed seven aid workers from World Central Kitchen–Leader Jeffries: Correct. And that was– that– that was horrific, including one American. Now in terms of the loss of innocent Palestinian life in this tough theater of war, that is deeply disturbing, tragic and should be painful for anyone who has a shred of humanity in their body. Norah O’Donnell: In March, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a staunch supporter of Israel, spoke out against the way it’s waging war in Gaza.Sen. Chuck Schumer (in March): The fourth major obstacle to peace is Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Norah O’Donnell: Was Leader Schumer’s speech a turning point?Leader Jeffries: Anything that Chuck Schumer has to say on the subject is gonna be incredibly important and received. But at the same time, every single member of Congress has the responsibility of answering to their constituency. That’s the beauty of American democracy. So what Leader Schumer has to say on a given issue, what Mitch McConnell has to say on a given issue, yeah, there’s some importance connected to it in Congress inside the Beltway.Norah O’Donnell: That was a very long answer without answering my question. (laugh)Leader Jeffries: Well, it– it was– it–Norah O’Donnell: I mean, come on.Leader Jeffries: Yeah.Norah O’Donnell: Chuck Schumer criticizing the Prime Minister of Israel, calling for him to be replaced, that’s a big deal.Leader Jeffries: Chuck Schumer’s words speak for themselves. But I think that trying to suggest that Leader Schumer is somehow undermining the U.S.-Israel relationship is ridiculous. Norah O’Donnell: How worried are you that voters’ frustration with President Biden over the war in Gaza could hurt Democrats’ chances in this election year?Leader Jeffries: We can’t take any vote for granted. But I also believe that, at the end of the day, voters are gonna look at the totality of circumstances. Who is fighting to deliver for everyday Americans, and who is simply fighting for himself? Norah O’Donnell: Hakeem Jeffries says he learned about fighting for everyday Americans from his parents. His father was a substance abuse counselor. His mother, a social worker, who Jeffries says taught him and his brother, a college professor, to work hard and be good to people. Jeffries attended NYU Law School, worked for a prestigious law firm, then spent a few years as an attorney for 60 Minutes’ parent company, CBS, before entering politics in 2006.Norah O’Donnell: You are the first Black leader for either party in either house ever. What does that say about America?Leader Jeffries: Government of the people, by the people and for the people isn’t just a theoretical concept. Like, it actually exists in America.Norah O’Donnell: He was raised in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, a few blocks away from his district…where Sundays were for church. At 12 years old, he became an usher, and says it taught him how to talk to people… Jeffries says he visited more than 60 churches in Brooklyn last year. One of Jeffries’ allies told us his ability to connect to both young and old Black voters makes him an important surrogate for President Biden this fall.Norah O’Donnell: Black voters are a core Democratic constituency. Why do you think support for President Biden has decreased among Black voters?Leader Jeffries: I think that tremendous progress has been made– for African Americans under the leadership of Joe Biden that’s quantifiable. But the reality is, there’s still real challenges.Norah O’Donnell: One new challenge in communities in New York City and in many others around the country is the influx of migrants. Shelters to house thousands of them have gone up in and around Jeffries’ district.Norah O’Donnell: What do you say to voters who not only see migrants streaming into the U.S. not just from Mexico and Latin America, but also from China and other countries and wonder, “What’s Congress doing about this?”Leader Jeffries: We have a broken immigration system and we have clear challenges at the border that we have to confront decisively and in a bipartisan way. And the American people are crying out for us to do something about the situation at the border in a manner consistent with our values. Norah O’Donnell: How big of an issue will abortion rights be this election year?Leader Jeffries: It’s gonna be an incredibly significant issue because on its own, it’s about freedom. And the extreme MAGA Republicans have set in motion the erosion of reproductive freedom. We’re gonna fight for it with everything that we’ve got at our disposal. If Roe v. Wade can fall, anything can fall. Social Security can fall. Medicare can fall. Voting rights can fall. And God help us all, but democracy itself can fall. If Roe v. Wade can fall, then anything can fall.Norah O’Donnell: Leader Jeffries says Democrats have a story to tell beyond what voters have to lose in November, and pointed to legislative wins for gun safety, and the billions invested in American manufacturing and infrastructure.Leader Jeffries: Those are real results. Norah O’Donnell: But two-thirds of voters think the economy was better under President Trump.Leader Jeffries: Well, that’s just not the case. And we have to do a better job of laying out the facts that the economy has dramatically improved under the leadership of President Joe Biden. Norah O’Donnell: But if– if those are the facts, why don’t voters believe it? Is that a communication problem?Leader Jeffries: Voters understand that more needs to be done, that there are challenges that remain. We understand we have to lower costs. We have to end price gouging. We have to grow the middle class. We have to keep our communities safe. We have to solve the problems and challenges at the border. We’re on the right side of those issues. And we just have to make sure we make that case in a compelling, a clear and a comprehensive way to the American people.Norah O’Donnell: You admit you haven’t done that yet?Leader Jeffries: It’s a work in progress.Full interview can be watched here. ### Subscribe to our e-newsletter that provides updates

May 7,Christopher H. Smith,R,N.J.-4,Smith announces 2024 Congressional Art Competition winners,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: May 6, 2024 MEDIA CONTACT:  e: brian.phillips@mail.house.gov c: 202.913.0126 New York, NY — Today, Congresswoman Yvette D. Clarke (NY-09) and U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) held a joint press conference to announce the reintroduction of their bicameral Affordable Housing and Area Median Income Fairness Act. While many factors contribute to the housing crisis, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) calculation known as Area Median Income (AMI), used to determine rent prices and income limits for affordable units, disadvantages actual low-income families seeking the affordable housing intended for them. Currently, AMI is informed by income data from the entire metropolitan area – which means data from the wealthiest areas of Westchester and Rockland County is being used when determining who qualifies for housing in low-income communities across the New York City region. This bill takes a multipronged approach to addressing some of the core challenges that have led to a severe lack of affordable housing in our nation’s urban areas. It would create over 350,000 new units of affordable housing with a $15 billion annual investment and directs HUD to assess alternative calculation methods for AMI to better include eligible low-income families in affordable housing determinations. “Soaring rent prices and a severe shortage of affordable housing units are displacing low-income communities nationwide, including my hometown of Brooklyn. This makes basic housing unattainable for those who need it most,” said Rep. Yvette Clarke. “In Brooklyn, finding affordable housing is extremely difficult. When units do become available, they often go to applicants with the strongest applications, not necessarily the families in greatest need. To combat this widespread crisis, Senator Gillibrand and I are re-introducing the Affordable Housing and Area Median Income Fairness Act. This legislation addresses how the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) calculates Area Median Income (AMI), a statistic that determines income caps and rent levels for affordable housing. I am confident in our ability to bring much needed change, so that we can ensure every person has access to this fundamental right. Because housing is a right for all.” “The affordable housing crisis in this country today is truly out of control. We are seeing the most vulnerable in our communities continue to be priced out of their homes and apartments at the same time that vacancy rates across the city are at historic lows, especially affordable units,” said U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. “The Affordable Housing and Area Median Income Fairness Act would reexamine our approach to calculating AMI and invest $15 billion annually to help make housing more affordable for low-income and middle-class families in New York. No hard-working American should have to go bankrupt simply for trying to live in a safe, accessible home, and I look forward to fighting for this bill in the Senate.” “We’ve been working hard to ensure that the State of New York takes decisive action to address the interrelated crises of homelessness, housing instability, and unaffordability, but we know that we need government at all levels to work collaboratively on these enormous challenges. That’s why I applaud my friends Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and Representative Yvette Clarke for their very ambitious proposal to dramatically increase federal funding for production of affordable housing, and to ensure that the housing we do produce and support is truly affordable for New Yorkers who need it. I will do everything I can to support Senator Gillibrand’s and Rep. Clarke’s efforts to win passage of this important legislation, get these resources allocated, and finally ensure that all New Yorkers have the opportunity to live in high-quality, safe, affordable, and accessible housing,” said State Senator Brian Kavanagh, chair of the NYS Senate Housing Committee. “One in three New Yorkers now spends half their monthly income on rent, a clear indication of the growing affordable housing crisis,” said New York State Assemblymember Linda B. Rosenthal (D/WF – Manhattan), Chair of the Assembly Committee on Housing. “Rents are rising nationwide, yet wages have remained stagnant, leaving people with fewer housing options than ever before. Reexamining the calculation of the Area Median Income metric, which is relied upon to determine eligibility for affordable housing, would make affordable housing more accessible to those with the greatest need. The Affordable Housing and Area Median Income Fairness Act would also make a $15 billion investment in vital programs that will spur the creation of affordable housing in communities statewide. I applaud Senator Gillibrand for introducing this legislation and look forward to collaborating on solutions to address New York’s affordable housing crisis.” More than one-third of New York City households spend at least half of their incomes on rent, and one-half of households can’t afford basic necessities due to the high cost of living in NYC. In recent years, homelessness in New York City has reached its highest levels since the Great Depression. The Affordable Housing and AMI Fairness Act would: ###

May 3,Bruce Westerman,R,Ark.-4,Antisemitism Has No Place on College Campuses,"Random Lengths News  May 5, 2024  By Daniel Rivera, Reporter On May 3, Habitat for Humanity Los Angeles announced a new eight-townhouse project in Long Beach and celebrated a $500,000 grant from Rep. Nanette Barragan’s office. The new Habitat for Humanity project will be sited on Orange Avenue in North Long Beach.  Barragan requested funding from the House Committee on Appropriations in March 2023.  In the letter, she called the project an appropriate use of taxpayer funds due to its support for constructing new homes with affordable mortgages for low-income families. “I have had the opportunity to go on their build sites, to help build homes for communities in need, for families in need of housing, so when we saw this opportunity to bring more housing to Long Beach, we said, ‘Let’s do it.’” Barragan and Habitats have been working together for years, with the representative volunteering with them before her time as a congresswoman. She and the rest of the Habitats Team see it as a crucial part of providing homes to Long Beach while also building generation wealth so that those families can stay in their homes. “We currently have 36 homes in construction like this in Downtown Long Beach. We have built over 100 homes in the city of Long Beach,” Darrell Simien, Habitat for Humanity’s Senior Vice President of Community Development told Random Lengths News.  “It’s very lucky it passed because we didn’t know if this was going to be a budget to pass in the congress,” Congresswomen Barragan said, referring to the budgetary impasse that caused by the debt ceiling crisis in 2023. The complete federal budget was passed on April 23 and signed into law by President Joe Biden the next day.   She explained that it’s difficult to get budget items earmarked in Congress due to a change in the rules for earmarking proposals that prohibit non-profits from receiving community development grants from the federal government. And that the request for the housing grant was made before this change happened back in April, any future grants from the federal government will be more difficult to get if not impossible depending on the classification of the organization. Barragan explained that ownership interest was prioritized in order to help low income families be able to attain the goal of generational wealth with an affordable mortgage that go toward financing the building of  homes.” Habitat for Humanity uses traditional contractors, volunteer labor, and the labor of prospective homeowners to build the homes.  The townhouses will be modular and fabricated off-site in a factory. The modules will then get transported to and assembled on-site with the help of contractors and volunteers.  The president and CEO of Habitats for Humanity Los Angeles Erin Rank told Random Lengths News that this approach will speed up the building process and make it possible to build the homes even faster while keeping costs down.  Each townhouse has a 1,300 square-foot floor plan, including two bedrooms, two baths, and a two-car garage along the alleyway in the back. The site used to be the North Long Beach Library, which closed in 2016 when the Michelle Obama Library on Atlantic Avenue, between Lime and East 59th Street, opened.  An acquisition loan provided the land for Long Beach Community Investment Company amounting to  $717,000. LBCIC works on behalf of the city and facilitates new homes being built in Long Beach to help address the housing shortages.  During the conference, Rank said that a “lemming library” will be installed on-site during construction to honor the history of the library that once stood there.  Stay up-to-date on District 44's latest news, updates and more!

EXTREME MAGA REPUBLICANS ARE FOCUSED ON FREEDOM FOR REFRIGERATORS,"Subscribe to receive the latest news, insights, and updates directly to your inbox. TAMPA, FL – Today, U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor (FL-14) announced $1,456,798 in federal grant funding awarded to the Corporation to Develop Communities (CDC) of Tampa, Inc. through the U.S. Department of Labor’s YouthBuild grant initiative. The new funding will support job training and employment services to expand access to apprenticeship opportunities, prepare young workers for quality jobs and strengthen the nation’s workforce to meet industry needs. Photos and a recording of today’s press conference can be accessed here. “I am grateful for the work of CDC of Tampa in preparing and connecting our young neighbors with good-paying jobs in growing industries, like construction,” said Rep. Castor. “This new grant funding from DOL will help expand economic opportunities for young people across the Tampa Bay area while growing the region’s skilled workforce and supporting the local economy.” “As our economy continues to grow, expand and innovate, it is important we create pathways to employment for underrepresented youth in high-demand trades,” said Ernest M. Coney Jr., MPH, President & CEO, CDC of Tampa, Inc. “This important funding will help the CDC of Tampa increase employment opportunities, increase entrepreneurship opportunities and increase homeownership rates, helping lift all our communities.”"

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Reps. Kathy Castor (D-FL) and Rob Wittman (R-VA), along with Reps. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL) and Michael Waltz (R-FL), led a bipartisan group of members of Congress in urging the House Appropriations Committee to support the U.S. Department of Energy’s work to advance critical minerals and materials (CMM) innovation in Fiscal Year 2025 appropriations legislation. In a letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, the lawmakers underscored the importance of advancing CMM innovation to support domestic supply chains and reduce the United States’ reliance on CMMs from adversarial nations like China. “Rising demand for critical minerals in the U.S. is leading to increasing dependence on foreign sources of critical minerals and their downstream products. Crucially, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) controls most of the market for processing and refining cobalt, lithium, rare earth elements, and other critical minerals. The PRC’s dominance of these supply chains, according to a White House interagency report, stems from Beijing’s aggressive deployment of industrial policies, including research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) investments and strategic international partnerships, and market manipulation,” the lawmakers wrote. The lawmakers continued, “The Fiscal Year 2025 Appropriations bill creates an important opportunity for Congress to advance CMM innovation and develop next-generation industries free from CCP influence. The Subcommittee, we believe, should fund the essential work of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to develop reliable, resilient, affordable, diverse, sustainable, and secure domestic critical mineral and material supply chains.” “Critical minerals and materials are fundamental to our modern society, quietly powering the technologies and innovations that shape our daily lives. Because U.S. reliance on the PRC and other foreign sources for these materials places our national and economic security at risk, CMM innovation is a bipartisan imperative. Congress must support DOE in taking impactful and wide-ranging actions to address this challenge and secure our domestic supply chains. We look forward to working with the Subcommittee on this matter,” the lawmakers concluded. The letter was signed by Representatives Kathy Castor (D-FL), Rob Wittman (R-VA), Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL), Michael Waltz (R-FL), Chrissy Houlahan (D-PA), Dusty Johnson (R-SD), (André Carson (D-IN), Andy Barr (R-KY), Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ), and Haley Stevens (D-MI).

May 7,Christopher H. Smith,R,N.J.-4,"<span class=""kicker"">Democracy, freedom, rule of law under attack by Lula government </span>Widespread evidence of political censorship and persecution in Brazil presented at human rights hearing chaired by Smith","May 6, 2024 WASHINGTON – Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) issued the following statement on Steward Health Care’s filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy: “Steward Health Care has failed the tens of thousands of patients and workers it serves in Massachusetts and across the country, and Steward filing for bankruptcy today is another damning indictment of our for-profit healthcare system in America,” said Congresswoman Pressley. “This is a public health crisis for our communities—especially for the vulnerable patients who receive their care at Carney Hospital and St. Elizabeth’s in Dorchester—and we must do everything we can to keep Steward hospitals open and care accessible. I’m grateful to the Healey-Driscoll Administration for prioritizing an orderly transfer of ownership that protects our patients and providers, and I won’t stop fighting to hold Steward executives accountable for their gross incompetence that has put lives in the Massachusetts 7th at risk.” In January 2024, Rep. Pressley following a Boston Globe report indicating that Steward Health Care System is in dire financial condition, Rep. Pressley, Sen. Warren, and the Massachusetts congressional delegation pressed Steward to brief them on Steward’s financial position, the status of their Massachusetts facilities, and their plans to ensure the communities they serve are not abandoned.  In February 2024, Rep. Pressley joined members of the Massachusetts congressional delegation in seeking answers from Cerebrus on the private equity firm’s role in creating the current financial challenges at Steward hospitals, which threaten access to medical care for thousands of people in eastern Massachusetts. ### Washington DC Office 402 Cannon HOB

May 6,Kathy Castor,D,Fla.-14,"Reps. Castor, Wittman Lead Bipartisan Colleagues in Urging Investments to Secure Domestic Supply of Critical Minerals","Dear Friend, I hope you have had a good week. I wanted to share an update on the work I did this week in Congress. On Thursday, I joined a bipartisan group of Appropriations Committee members in a visit to Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse. We visited the site by boat, were briefed at the U.S. Coast Guard Command Center, and met with local officials to discuss the role of the federal government in assisting with the recovery. Visiting the site in person made it clear just how important the rebuilding of this critical land and sea thoroughfare is. It also highlighted the need for local, state and federal partners to work together on this project. As the lead Democrat on the Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the Department of Transportation, I am committed to ensuring that our country is not only able to address emergencies like this one but also taking preemptive steps to repair damaged bridges and roads that could lead to our next disaster. The Bipartisan Infrastructure bill took critical steps to address this need and Congress must now work to fill any remaining gaps. I will continue working with my colleagues on both side of the aisle and in both chambers until our tunnels, bridges, and roads are the envy of the world. Thanks to funding provided by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Environmental Protection Agency announced the dedication of $3 billion to identify and replace lead service lines in states and territories to prevent lead exposure in drinking water and protect public health. I was pleased to see that $240 million of that funding will go directly towards our great state of Illinois. No matter where you live, everyone should have access to clean, safe drinking water. Today’s announcement is another win in the fight to see this mission through and replace dangerous lead service lines in Illinois. With efforts like these, we can build a future in which access to safe drinking water is a right, not a privilege. As the Ranking Member on the Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development (THUD) Appropriations Subcommittee, I met with the Secretary of Transportation, Pete Buttigieg and the Acting Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Adrianne Todman to discuss their respective department's funding requests for the 2025 fiscal year. In my hearing with Secretary Buttigieg, we discussed protecting the safety of our transportation workers and the department's emergency relief fund in light of the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse. During my questioning of Secretary Todman, I asked if they anticipate additional funding needs for the Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery program and how the department is addressing rising homelessness. Both hearings provided critical insight to developing a THUD appropriations bill that will effectively address our nation's transit and housing needs. Don't forget, our office is always here to help. You can call my DC office at (202) 225-4061 or my Chicago office at (773) 267-5926. You can also email me through my website at Quigley.house.gov/contact.

“President Shafik and Columbia University administrators have displayed a shocking unwillingness to control their campus. They’ve allowed outside agitators and terrorist-sympathizing students and faculty to rewrite campus rules and spew vile, anti-Jewish aggression. Now, thousands of students who’ve worked hard to achieve their degrees will not get the recognition they deserve.

“Because it is abundantly clear that President Shafik would rather cede control to Hamas supporters than restore order, Columbia’s Board of Trustees should immediately remove her and appoint a new president who will. Our once great universities desperately need strong moral leadership, now more than ever.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. — House Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition (SEEC) Members Reps. Kathy Castor and Mike Levin along with the SEEC Co-Chairs – Reps. Doris Matsui, Mike Quigley, and Paul Tonko – issued the following statement after the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized strong limits on pollution from fossil fuel-fired power plants, under the agency's Clean Air Act Section 111 authorities. These five members led a letter along with 95 of their colleagues last July calling for the swift finalization of the strongest possible carbon pollution standards for power plants by early 2024. “We are glad to see that EPA heeded our call to finalize a strong rule to cut pollution from dirty power plants and ensure that generations of Americans can breathe clean air and live on a habitable planet. Our power sector is the second largest source of climate pollution in our nation, driving poor air quality in local neighborhoods and accelerating the climate crisis for the entire planet. Time and time again, Congress has reaffirmed EPA’s authority and obligation under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act to protect Americans from sources of dangerous air pollution, including our power plants. “EPA’s power plant carbon pollution standards are an important part of our efforts to achieve our goal of halving America’s planet-warming pollution by 2030. Our most polluting power plants will utilize proven and readily available control technologies to upgrade their facilities to deliver cost-effective and clean electricity to the American people. As a result, these carbon emission standards will slash pollution by 83% below 2005 levels and deliver $370 billion in cumulative climate and health benefits over the next two decades, with almost no impact on electricity rates. “Paired with our historic climate investments, the Biden Administration’s pollution standards only further solidify our path to a clean energy future. While we would have preferred this rule include standards for existing gas power plants, we stand ready to work with the EPA to finalize a subsequent strong rule focused on incorporating a larger percentage of the existing gas fleet than the original proposed rule. Time is of the essence, and we look forward to finishing the job in cleaning up our power sector and closing the gap on our climate and environmental justice goals.” Background"

WASHINGTON—Idaho Congressman Mike Simpson cosponsored the bipartisan Not Just a Number Act, legislation to require the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to take a more comprehensive look at the factors that best prevent veteran suicide. “Behind every veteran suicide lies a heartbreaking story, a silent struggle, and an irreplaceable loss,” said Rep. Simpson. “Through expanding suicide prevention research and a thorough analysis of factors behind veteran suicide, the Not Just a Number Act would provide a better understanding how we can help veterans in their time of need. Supporting our veterans and ensuring they have the resources they need has always been one of my top priorities. Our veterans fulfilled their duty to serve us, and now, it's our responsibility to serve them.” The Not Just a Number Act would require the VA to examine benefits usage in their annual suicide prevention report to evaluate the relationship between VA benefits and veteran suicide. Additionally, this legislation would have the VA analyze which benefits have the most significant impact on preventing suicide and require the Department to issue recommendations for the expansion of those benefits in their fight to combat veteran suicides. Lastly, the bill would include a study on upstream veteran suicide prevention, create a toolkit for state and local medical examiners to improve reporting on veteran suicide and a feasibility and advisability study on elevating the VA’s suicide prevention office to the Office of the Secretary level. The full text of the bill is available here."
May 6,Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan,D,Northern Marianas Islands,Tracking students progress,"Rep. Chris Smith (R-Manchester) speaks to the press while viewing the encampment staged by antisemitic, anti-Israel, pro-Hamas protesters at Rutgers University on Thursday, May 2nd.             In response to Rutgers University’s announced “resolution,” Rep. Chris Smith (R-Manchester) today asked whether the school administration’s reply to the ten demands issued by the encampment organizers amounted to appeasement of antisemitic, anti-Israel, pro-Hamas protesters.             Included among their most egregious demands, the protesters ordered Rutgers to:             · “Divest from any firm or corporation materially participating in, benefitting from, or otherwise supporting the state of Israel’s settler colonialism, apartheid, and genocide of Palestine and the Palestinian people…”;             · “Terminate its partnership with Tel Aviv University…”;             · Give out scholarships to Gazan students with taxpayer funding; and             · “…release a statement from the Office of the President acknowledging the ongoing genocide against Palestinians….”             “Any capitulation whatsoever to antisemitic, anti-Israel, pro-Hamas protesters is absolutely disgraceful,” said Smith, who visited the New Brunswick campus on Thursday to view the encampment on Voorhees Mall.             Just yesterday, Rutgers published a “comprehensive list” of protester demands—which included full amnesty for their actions—that were set forth as requirements for ending the  encampment, which reportedly disrupted 28 exams and impacted more than 1,000 students.             “Instead of rewarding unbridled hatred for Jews and the nation of Israel, Rutgers should be working to combat the violent and antisemitic threats that have been escalating against Jewish students on campus,” said Smith, who co-chairs the House Task Force for Combating Antisemitism.             “The action taken by University officials is especially concerning in light of the ongoing investigation by Congress into Rutgers’ egregious history of antisemitism and its failure to protect Jewish students,” said Smith, who vowed to continue pressing to hold top leaders at the state university accountable.             A March letter informing the University of the congressional investigation notes that “Rutgers stands out for the intensity and pervasiveness of antisemitism on its campuses.” The letter, which Smith said reads more like an indictment, specifically states that “Rutgers-Newark’s Center for Security, Race and Rights (CSRR) has become notorious as a hotbed of radical antisemitic, anti-American, anti-Israel, and pro-terrorist activity.”             Smith said that Rutgers has submitted approximately 80,000 pages to date in response to the congressional investigation that remains underway but noted that the vast majority of them have not been illuminative thus far.             In a speech on the House Floor earlier this week, Smith reiterated that “Hamas is a terrorist organization that commits mass murder of Jews and seeks the evisceration of Israel.”             “Don’t believe it?” Smith continued. “Remember the horrific violence of October 7th and the ongoing ordeal of the hostages. Or just read the Hamas Charter of 1988, the blueprint for genocide against the Jews—a modern-day Nazi-like final solution. ###   Chris has three offices dedicated to constituent services.

May 6,Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan,D,Northern Marianas Islands,Examining Labors 2025 budget,"SEATTLE, WA – U.S. Representative Pramila Jayapal applauds the Biden Administration’s decision to cancel $6 billion in student loan debt for former students of the Art Institutes, a system of predatory, for-profit colleges, including the Art Institute of Seattle. “Predatory, for-profit institutions, like the Art Institutes, prey on disadvantaged students striving for a better future,” said Jayapal. “I personally met with students from the Art Institute of Seattle in 2019, the same year they closed their doors with more than 600 students unable to finish the semester. These students were left with crushing debt, incomplete degrees, and few options for recourse. I am grateful to the administration for taking this step to bring justice to students.” This step from the administration is part of the $160 billion in student debt cancellation the Biden administration has authorized, more than 10 percent of all federal student loan debt.  After meeting with students from the Art Institute in Seattle, Jayapal introduced the Students Not Profits Act to protect students from the predatory practices of for-profit colleges by ending taxpayer subsidies to these schools. Jayapal is also the lead sponsor of the College for All Act, which would eliminate tuition and fees at public colleges and universities for single-parent families making up to $125,000 and married families making up to $250,000, while also making trade school and community college free for every person across the country.

Clarke (NY-09) released the following statement regarding the Biden-Harris Administration’s action to to allow DACA recipients access to healthcare coverage through the Affordable Care Act: “Our nation’s Dreamers have long represented an irreplaceable part of the great mosaic that is America. That is why I am proud to celebrate today’s announcement from the Biden-Harris Administration that will allow eligible DACA recipients greater access to federally run health insurance. Through the administration’s actions, nearly 100,000 previously uninsured participants in the DACA program will not only have the opportunity to access affordable, quality health insurance, but the peace of mind that comes with it. This new rule represents the next chapter in our fight to deliver to Dreamers the lives they deserve. But despite this significant progress, we cannot forget that we must continue to deliver a pathway to citizenship and permanent status. Alongside the tireless efforts of the administration and the support of immigrant families in communities nationwide, I am certain we will succeed.” ###

May 6,Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan,D,Northern Marianas Islands,NOAA at work," Ms. McCollum: Mr. Speaker, I rise to address my vote against H.R. 6090, the Antisemitism Awareness Act.  This bill would require the Department of Education to utilize the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism when interpreting whether an action or practice violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964.   To be clear: I condemn antisemitism in all its forms and stand with the Jewish community as they mourn the losses sustained in the October 7 terrorist attack by Hamas and the subsequent increase in antisemitic incidents in the U.S. and around the world.   But requiring the Department of Education to use the IHRA definition would stifle free speech and curtail legitimate criticisms of the Israeli government’s actions.  I concur with J Street, which noted: “On its own, the IHRA Working Definition, coupled with its contemporary examples, is broad and can label legitimate political speech and critique of Israel as inherently antisemitic. We are concerned that this concerted campaign to require the use of the IHRA definition and its examples by law and regulation creates significant opportunities for abuse and politicization, including by future MAGA-aligned administrations.”  This bill violates First Amendment rights to share and debate ideas and express peaceful dissent. It is too broad and could lead to colleges and universities banning student groups that aim to provide safe refuge, community, and space to discuss issues that are important to them based on the opinion or statement of one student.   Thank you, and I yield back. "
May 6,Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan,D,Northern Marianas Islands,"Welcome, Shigeki","502 Cannon HOB, Washington, DC 20515Email Me(202) 225-6435 The historic tornadoes which pummeled the eastern and central portions of our state last week were devastating, and supporting the ongoing recovery efforts for Nebraskans remains top of mind. The Nebraska Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) has reported damage to homes, farm equipment and buildings, power lines, other infrastructure, vehicles, and trees across many counties in the Third District. Fortunately, despite the destruction of hundreds of homes, no Nebraskans lost their lives. We owe such great thanks to the hard work of meteorologists, broadcasters, emergency responders, and countless volunteers who have donated time and resources to those affected. Less than 24 hours after the tornadoes went through, Kearney-based Hot Meals USA—founded by in 2019 by Dick Cochran—mobilized to serve thousands of meals to emergency workers, volunteers, and storm victims in Elkhorn, Bennington, Blair and elsewhere. Nebraskans are keenly aware we are in this together and consider it a hallowed opportunity to lend a hand. Yet the recovery efforts will continue for months to come, so we must continue providing necessary support and coordination. I’m grateful Governor Pillen’s dedication of state resources has been prompt. Throughout damage assessments, my team has been in touch with the governor’s team, and I have been working with our full congressional delegation, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to facilitate federal response and claims for disaster relief. My offices in Nebraska City, Grand Island, and Scottsbluff stand ready to assist individuals, families, and businesses who need help navigating government agencies or other relief resources. In addition, I am pleased to offer support to Nebraska’s county and local officials. To ensure damage estimates reflect the needs in the Third District, it is necessary to get an accurate valuation of the cost. Nebraskans who suffered damage are urged to report it to their county emergency management agencies and utilize available federal assistance through Farm Service Agency, Natural Resources Conservation Service, and Rural Development programs. Nebraskans have substantial experience with severe weather, and our geography indicates we will continue to deal with the associated risks. While we cannot control when storms come, what matters is our preparedness and response. I encourage Third District Nebraskans to remain prepared and maintain access to emergency alerts. Taking appropriate precautions can help us be prepared for the event of extreme weather. Thanks to modern communication tools, there are many ways to remain informed about approaching severe weather today such as television, radio, online alerts, weather radios, and early warning systems. Additionally, it’s wise to maintain an emergency kit, including essentials such as water, a flashlight with extra batteries, a battery-operated radio, non-perishable food, and a first aid kit. It is also important to make sure you store copies of important documents, such as property deeds and personal medical records in a secure, waterproof location. The disaster preparedness checklists and information at www.Ready.gov are helpful resources assembled by the Department of Homeland Security. While Arbor Day 2024 was marked by the violent storms which hit communities in Nebraska and other states, it has been wonderfully encouraging to witness the fast-acting kindness of Americans to care for one another. By coming together, we demonstrate the Nebraska value of looking out for our neighbors and gain the strength to overcome whatever comes our way. ###"
May 3,Mike Quigley,D,Ill.-5,Catching Up With Quigley: Week of April 29,"Congress returns to session today after a two-week Easter recess. While the House may have been on break, I had a very busy two weeks, first leading a delegation of my colleagues on a trip to Israel and then working around the district here at home.  Joint Schneider & Wasserman Schultz Delegations
Visiting with Israel President and First Lady Isaac and Michal Herzog In Israel, we visited both the Gaza and Lebanese borders and met with several government officials, including Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Isaac Herzog. In the meeting with the Prime Minister, we emphasized three priorities: I spoke about my trip with Jake Tapper of CNN (watch here).  After returning from my trip, I had a wonderful week at home. I visited with high school students in Winnetka, Warren Township and Antioch, as well as college students at Lake Forest College. We hosted our annual Congressional Art Competition at the College of Lake County, and I joined the STEAM Scholars students on a fascinating tour at Valent BioSciences in Libertyville. I toured several different sites around the district, including Keshet’s new facility in Highland Park, Kindercare in Round Lake, Handi-Foil Corporation in Antioch, ARCOA in Gurnee and Growmark in Hebron. As always, we had many people visit the office to share their stories, priorities and ideas.
Back in Washington, D.C., after finally passing the FY2024 spending bills, Congress must now work to catch up on the many important bills blocked by the six-month impasse over appropriations. Key among the priority legislation waiting for Congress to act is the Foreign Intelligence Security Act (FISA) reform bill, as well as a bill reauthorizing the Affordable Connectivity Program that provides internet to thousands of families in the Tenth District and is set to expire at the end of the month. Congress is also expected to act soon to address border security and pass essential national security funding for our allies Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. We are also waiting to see if the Senate will pass the bipartisan tax bill that passed overwhelmingly in the House in February. Please keep reading to learn more about happenings here at home and in Washington.  If you or your student is interested in Military Academy Service, please join me on Wednesday, April 24th from 6:00 pm to 7:30 pm for Service Academy Night. We will discuss how to apply for military academies and what you need to know throughout the nomination process. Click here to RSVP.
Representatives from each service academy will discuss their institution and the admissions process. Congressman Schneider will also discuss the Congressional nomination process. After the program concludes, students and parents will visit the tables to talk one-on-one with the academy representatives.
Students, parents, guidance counselors and school officials are welcome to attend.
Questions? Call my office at (847) 383-4870.  I was honored to join the Connecting to Classrooms Town Hall program again for a virtual conversation this year with Warren Township and Antioch Community High School students. The program, developed by a collaboration between Ohio State, Brown, and California Riverside universities, helps high school students engage with their Member of Congress on an important political issue through a “Deliberative Town Hall.”   Students at North Shore Country Day asked a variety of questions about current events and life in Congress. They are studying the election process, and we discussed what motivated me to seek public office and what it’s like to be on the campaign trail.  I enjoyed speaking with the 8:00 AM class on American Politics at Lake Forest College. (I mention the time because I was impressed by the students' waking up early for class and their insightful questions).   Valent BioSciences hosted the STEAM Scholars class and gave them a look at the exciting research work happening at their facility in Libertyville. Among the many science-related professionals working at Valent's research facility houses plant, soil, and formulation scientists, as well as microbiologists, entomologists, and chemists who work daily to help our country's agriculture flourish.
Thank you to CEO Salman Mir and John Mandel for welcoming students, Dr. Venburg and Dr. McHatton for leading our tour groups, and the rest of the Valent team for sharing more about their work and how our students can prepare now to take on the high-skill STEAM jobs of tomorrow.  I met with the Commanding Officer of Naval Station Great Lakes, Captain Steve Yargosz, the Executive Officer, Commander Terry Traweek, and Command Master Chief Jon Crisafulli. We had a wide-ranging conversation about activities at the base and around the community. One of the priorities we shared was addressing conditions at the Halsey Village neighborhood. During my time at home, I had the opportunity of visiting five of the many great companies that are standout organizations in our area.  I’m grateful to my friend Jen Phillips, who welcomed me to Keshet’s new facilities in Highland Park. Keshet Disabilities & Inclusion provides educational, recreational, vocational and social programs for individuals with intellectual disabilities, operating according to traditional Jewish values.   At the Kindercare facility in Round Lake I visited the different classrooms and talked with the management team about some of the challenges facing childcare providers. I enjoyed my time meeting the “students” ranging in age from six weeks to five years old, especially having the chance to read to one of the groups.   Thanks to the team at ARCOA for showing me around their facilities in Waukegan and Gurnee. ARCOA works with clients to securely recycle and remanufacture technology like computers, copiers and more). They serve clients around the world, including the U.S. government.  I also toured Handi-Foil’s Antioch facility, learning how they combine innovation and attention to detail to provide high-quality, American-made foil products to familiar names like Costco, Sam’s Club and Chipotle.  I visited Von Bergen Farm in Hebron to talk with Mike Von Bergen and other members of the Conserve FS and Growmark family. We talked about some of the challenges farmers face and the importance of passing the Farm Bill before the end of the year. We also shared some of Mike’s mother’s delicious apple pie. I love welcoming people to our Lincolnshire office to talk about policy, share ideas, or help tackle challenges people face in dealing with our federal agencies. Remember, if you would like to meet with me, you don’t have to travel to Washington; you can always request a meeting here at home.  The executive board of the Ukrainian Congress of America came to update me on the war in Ukraine and reinforce the importance of the House passing the essential aid bill that will help the people of Ukraine defeat Russia’s illegal invasion.  I enjoyed catching up with representatives from New York Life to talk about the important work they do serving their client's financial security needs.  Allan Navaro, Facility Administrator at DaVita’s center in Lake Villa, and Kiyomi Hamilton, Regional Director, came to our office to share the work DeVita is doing to provide for people in Lake County and across the country who are dealing with kidney disease.  Lake County Administrator Patrice Sutton and I met to discuss how we can work together to serve Lake County residents. Administrator Sutton was elected to her current position in October of 2023. WHAT’S HAPPENING IN WASHINGTON  One of the early signs of spring is the annual visit with representatives from our local Garden Clubs. This year, I welcomed guests from Lake Forest, Winnetka and Wilmette to discuss their legislative priorities for the year.  Dr. Tom Shanley (President and CEO), Susan Hayes Gordon (SVP, Chief External Affairs Officer) and Fatema Zanzi (EVP, Chief Administrative and Legal Officer) of Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital in Chicago stopped by to discuss federal policies impacting child health and issues specifically important to Lurie.  American companies play an important role in Egypt’s economy. Members of the American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt visited Washington to highlight their work and the importance of a strong U.S.-Egypt relationship.  The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum hosted a group of college-age immigrant students from Paris who traveled to the U.S. to learn more about the Holocaust and fighting hate. As a Trustee of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, I was happy to welcome them to my office and discuss my work combatting antisemitism.  My good friend Ted Deutch, a former colleague and CEO of the American Jewish Committee, sat down with members of the House Bipartisan Task Force for Combating Antisemitism to discuss the ongoing battle against antisemitism in America.  I was honored to address the ANC of Illinois during their annual visit to the Capitol to discuss the ongoing situation in Artsakh (Ngorno Karabakh) and the future of Armenian–U.S. relations.  The Asian American Hotel Owners Association met on Capitol Hill to discuss their industry with legislators and how their businesses impact their communities. I was happy to stop by and express my appreciation for their work, especially to connect with friends from home.  My dear friend David Lega, a member of the European Parliament in Brussels, and Magnus Berntsson, a member of the Swedish Parliament, dropped by to discuss shared interests between the European Union, Sweden and the United States. David is also a founder and fellow member of the Inter-Parliamentary Task Force Combating Online Antisemitism.  I met with student leaders of Olami, a worldwide outreach organization for Jewish students, leading a grassroots initiative empowering students to take a stand against antisemitism. I’ve been clear that we must call out antisemitism and all prejudice and hate wherever and whenever it rears its ugly head. Please visit my website to find resources available for everything from saving money on your internet bill to locating your local food bank and many other help lines.  My Office at the Waukegan Township is Open Every Monday to Serve You You don’t need to travel to Lincolnshire to meet with my casework team. If you need any assistance with a Passport, Medicare, Social Security, the Veterans Administration or immigration, you can now schedule an appointment to meet with our caseworkers in a location near you to discuss any federal issues you may have.

If you have any questions or need help making an appointment, you can always contact my Lincolnshire Office at (847) 383-4870.  Spring is officially here, even if the thermometer doesn’t show it. I had a great time with Julie at the annual Orchid Show at the Chicago Botanic Garden. We were dazzled by the beauty of the wide variety of orchids on display and the extraordinary creativity of the show’s design team.
As the weather begins to warm and things start to bloom around us, I hope you and your loved ones have the opportunity to enjoy the new season and visit the Garden as well as many other wonderful areas around our Tenth District. Sincerely,

May 6,Mike Kelly,R,Pa.-16,Kelly honors winners of 2024 Congressional Art Competition,"Maybe, just maybe we will vote this weekend on the essential national security and foreign assistance funding bill. More on that in a moment, but first, I want to reflect on a local story.  Dax with partner, Deputy John ForlenzaSource: Lake County Sheriff All of Lake County joins with the Lake County Sheriff’s Office in mourning the passing of K-9 Dax two days after the often-decorated police dog retired from service. Books could be written about the important contributions Dax made to the sheriff’s office and our community--and likely will be. Just as significant as his heroic deeds, however, was the role Dax played in connecting the community. Anyone who ever met him will remember Dax as a kind soul. 
In a fitting tribute to Dax, virtually every local news outlet ran a story about Dax’s life and loss (ABC, CBS, Fox 32, NBC, WGN, Daily Herald, Sun-Times, Chicago Tribune). May Dax’s memory live in the hearts of everyone he touched. 
Back in Washington, Congress returned to work after a short but eventful weekend. The world tensely watched Iran’s unprecedented attack on Israel last Saturday night—for the first time launching their attack from Iranian territory and involving more than 170 suicide attack drones, 30 cruise missiles, and 120 ballistic missiles. Iran’s salvo was joined with rockets fired at Israel by Hezbollah in Lebanon, militias in Syria, and the Houthis in Yemen. Thankfully, a truly remarkable alliance comprising Israel, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Kingdom of Jordan, and others coordinated to defeat 99 percent of the missiles and drones before they were able to reach their intended targets.
Following the attack, House leadership changed its original plans for the week and will now, finally, focus on the critically important national security and foreign aid funding legislation requested by the White House late last year and passed by the Senate more than two months ago. Unfortunately, rather than simply passing the single, comprehensive Senate bill, which would then immediately go to President Biden for his signature, Speaker Johnson is trying to appease the extremists in his party with a jerry-rigged set of separate bills that will at best, delay the essential aid and humanitarian assistance desperately needed by our allies in Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan. Worse yet, it’s not clear Speaker Johnson will even be able to convince the extremists to allow the bills to come to the floor for a vote.
I’m remaining in Washington into the weekend as we move toward a vote on this important legislation. I’m hopeful we will finally pass this crucial national security aid and that the Senate will quickly approve it, at long last sending it to President Biden to sign. Please keep reading to learn more about happenings here at home and in Washington.  If you or your student is interested in Military Academy Service, please join me on Wednesday, April 24th from 6:00 pm to 7:30 pm for Service Academy Night. We will discuss how to apply for military academies and what you need to know throughout the nomination process. Click here to RSVP.
After the program concludes, students and parents will visit the tables to talk one-on-one with the academy representatives. Students, parents, guidance counselors and school officials are welcome to attend.
Questions? Call my office at (847) 383-4870.  It was a pleasure to speak at and attend the Thomas W. Doig Chapter of the Credit Unions’ Legislative Breakfast in Vernon Hills. We were joined by leaders of over 19 credit unions in their Chapter, serving over 275,000 members. I enjoyed being on a panel with Sen. Dan McConchie, State Rep. Rita Mayfield, Rep. Mark Walker, and Rep. Kevin Olickal.  The Prime Minister of Japan, Fumio Kishida, addressed a joint session of Congress last Thursday as part of his week-long visit to Washington. The Prime Minister’s address served as a reminder of the important role the US has played as a global leader and the need to set aside any doubt about what our role in the world should be. Our allies, such as Japan, count on us to help foster a secure and prosperous world and deter the threats of nefarious actors.    Last week, I also worked with my colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee to set the stage for work that will happen on tax policy in 2025. In 2017, my Republican colleagues passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act through a cynical, partisan process that was a far cry from the bipartisan, long-lasting tax policy we should be focused on. I’m looking forward to working with my colleagues on tax legislation that will bring relief and lasting change for Illinoisans, including an expanded Child Tax Credit and a Sustainable Aviation Fuel tax credit that will accelerate cleaner air and skies for us all.  You can watch my remarks here.  Today marks the 194th day that more than 130 hostages, including 8 Americans, are being held in Gaza. Last week, as family members of the American hostages sat in the House Gallery, I was honored to lead a bipartisan group of colleagues on the House floor in a call for Hamas to accept the six-week ceasefire proposal brokered by the United States, Egypt, and Qatar and accepted by Israel. The agreement would immediately release all women, children, and those needing medical assistance, opening the door to a more long-term resolution to the fighting. Sadly, as of yesterday, Hamas is still refusing to accept a ceasefire deal. You can watch my remarks here.  I was happy to welcome Keeping Families Covered and Cradles to Crayons Chicago to my office in Washington, DC, to discuss diaper banks' important role in supporting families. Did you know that 1 in 2 families nationwide struggle to afford diapers? On April 3rd, Keeping Families Covered held a mobile distribution event at Warren Library in Gurnee, where they distributed:  Overall, they served 362 children and 291 families in just two hours; I applaud their work ensuring no family is left without these essential items.  Illinois TRIO helps first-generation, low-income students and students with disabilities enter and complete college. I greeted them on their visit to the Capitol, and we discussed the impacts the federal TRIO program has on Illinois students.  The Regional Transit Authority oversees the Metra, PACE, and the CTA. I welcomed their leadership team to my office to discuss their funding and planning priorities for the next fiscal year.  I met with Advocates from the Alzheimer's Association and Alzheimer's Impact Movement (AIM). We discussed my cosponsorship of the NAPA Reauthorization Act, which supports coordinating federal programs addressing Alzheimer's disease.

Did you know that when Ukraine was under Soviet rule, Matzah baking was a criminal activity? Today, Ukraine is the largest exporter of Matzah outside of Israel! Just days before Passover begins on Monday, I was fortunate to receive a box of Shmurah Matzah that was hand-made in Ukraine from friends with the Ua-Resistance, a charity fund for Ukraine. 
Wishing you and yours a Chag Pesach Sameach should you celebrate the Festival of Freedom.

May 6,Kevin McCarthy,R,Calif.-20,Speaker Johnson Statement on Columbia Canceling Commencement,"For all of those observing, I hope you are having a meaningful Passover! The big news of the week was that on Saturday, the House finally passed critical national security funding that will help our allies Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan counter threats from Russia, Hamas, and China. I was proud to join with House Democratic leadership to insist that, in addition to the security aid for our allies, the legislative package had to also include significant humanitarian assistance, in particular for civilians in Gaza caught in the middle of the fighting between Hamas and Israel.  With Senate passage on Tuesday and President Biden’s signature on Wednesday, the U.S. can now deliver desperately needed military aid to soldiers in Ukraine and humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza and around the world. I’m proud to be part of the bipartisan coalition that advanced this crucial legislation to help our allies – and America’s interests, as well.  I’m also proud to join many others in our community in commending a local hero – Lake County sheriff’s 911 dispatcher Christy O’Dette. Last weekend, Christy calmly and expertly helped save the life of a man attempting suicide in Green Oaks. Please read more about Christy’s great work here. Please keep reading to learn more about happenings in Washington and here at home.  Because of the extended week in Washington to pass the foreign aid bills, I had to cancel many events and meetings at home on Friday and Saturday. Luckily, I was able to get home in time to attend the Lake Forest College Public Policy Analysis Challenge. The Public Policy Challenge is a year-long program where 16 teams, each working with a faculty mentor, developed and presented public policy ideas on how to reduce violence in America. On Sunday, the three teams that had earlier advanced to the final round formally presented their proposals to a panel for four judges. I was honored to be able to provide remarks at the start of the evening.  Last week, on the heels of Iran’s recent attack on Israel, the House passed H.R. 6408, a commonsense, bipartisan bill I introduced with Congressman David Kustoff to revoke the tax-exempt status of non-profits that have provided material support to specially designated terror groups (STDGs) or foreign terrorist organizations (FTOs). Put simply, groups giving support to terrorism should not have the privilege of advantaged tax status. You can watch my remarks on the bill here.  US Trade Representative Katherine Tai testified before the House Ways and Means Committee about the Administration’s trade priorities. During my time to ask questions of Trade Representative Tai, I highlighted our district’s researchers and innovators, all of whom depend on intellectual property protections. I am grateful for the Biden Administration’s tireless work in protecting US innovation. We also spoke about the importance of strengthening medical-related supply chains and working with trusted trade partners, rather than duplicitous actors like China. You can watch my remarks on the bill here.  Prior to passage of the foreign aid bills last Saturday, the House Foreign Affairs Committee held a hearing on the threat posed to U.S. interests by Russo–Iranian cooperation. I asked each of the three witnesses what they considered the most important action for Congress to take to address the growing threat posed by the growing alliance between two of our country’s greatest adversaries. The witnesses all agreed that there is nothing more important than passing the national security funding bills for Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan. Speaker Johnson should have brought to a vote the Senate-passed bill long ago—I’m glad the House was able to deliver that vote over the weekend. You can watch my remarks here.  Representatives of the Illinois Health and Hospital Association were in Washington to discuss the SAVE Act, which would create legal penalties for individuals who knowingly and intentionally assault hospital employees. Hospital employees are a cornerstone of our healthcare system; as a proud cosponsor of the SAVE Act, I remain committed to keeping hospitals a safe place for healthcare workers.   Our district is home to a wonderful variety of wildlife. I had the opportunity to meet with representatives of Openlands, an organization dedicated to preserving this wildlife and connecting people throughout Illinois to the outdoors. I appreciate their efforts to expand Hackmatack National Wildlife Refuge in McHenry County, and I look forward to continuing to support the first federal wildlife refuge within 100 miles of Chicago.   As we raced toward the final passage of funding for Ukraine last week, I had the opportunity meeting with UA-Resistance, a charity fund that helps Ukrainians defend against Putin’s continued invasion. And, in anticipation of Passover, they brought a box of special matzah made in Ukraine. I was surprised to learn that Ukraine exports matzahs around the world.   As a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, one of my most important responsibilities is building stronger relationships with leaders from around the globe. Last week, I had a robust conversation with Youssef Amrani, the Ambassador of Morocco. Especially in times like these, we must continue to strengthen the US-Morocco partnership and work toward a Middle East that is peaceful, prosperous, and secure.  I also met with Ekaterini Nassika, the Ambassador of Greece. We discussed cooperation on energy security amid global conflicts and opportunities to continue the longstanding partnership between the United States and Greece. Please visit my website to find resources available for everything from saving money on your internet bill to locating your local food bank, and various help lines.  In case you missed it, the Washington Post opined last week that, while traditional thinking has always held that humanity tamed dogs, it might be that dogs were the key to our advancement all along. As the author puts it: “Dogs enabled humans to settle down and stop their endless wandering. Dogs protected humans at this vulnerable transition from nomadic to settled life.” While I do not claim to be a biology expert, I can say from personal experience that dogs truly are humanity’s greatest partners. As I enjoy my time in the district—alongside my trusted canine companion, JoJo—I hope this article brings levity and joy into your day, just as it did mine.

April 25,Kathy Castor,D,Fla.-14,"U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor, SEEC Colleagues Applaud EPA's Strong Power Plant Pollution Standards","It sure was nice to be home last week, especially after two long weeks and a rare Saturday session in Washington. As always, I enjoyed traveling around the district, with visits to Northfield, Wheeling, Deerfield, Highland Park, Waukegan, Libertyville, and more. Each week at home is distinct, but last week was special—I had the chance to meet with many students, including through student town halls at Caruso and Edgewood Middle Schools, a lunch and learn session with the Together Towards Peace Roundtable and our annual Service Academy/ROTC Information Night with representatives from the Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force and Coast Guard, this year at Vernon Hills High School.
Before I share highlights of my week at home, I want to provide expanded thoughts on a trip I took this weekend, as well as some thoughts about the protests we are seeing on campuses around the country. This past weekend, I had a very special opportunity. I was invited to be a guest speaker at the World Economic Forum’s Special Meeting on Global Collaboration, Growth and Energy for Development in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. This event brought together nearly 1,000 senior leaders in government, business and NGOs from across the globe for discussions about topics ranging from climate change and clean energy to global trade policy to the future prospects for Middle East peace and development. In addition to my specific session on “Homeland Trade,” I had an opportunity to meet with high-level officials from Saudi Arabia, the United States and other countries to discuss the situation in Gaza and possibilities for a new direction for the entire Middle East. We talked about hopes for a ceasefire with the release of the hostages and a surge in aid into Gaza. I heard about continued plans for pursuing further normalization agreements with Israel, and everyone I met wanted my opinion about the upcoming election in the United States.
I returned early to Washington for votes in the House and so I left the conference early Monday morning, before Secretary of State Blinken arrived later in the day. I wish I could have heard Secretary Blinken’s remarks, but I share his and President Biden’s view that we are at an inflection point in the Middle East. I also agree that, while U.S. leadership is critically important, we cannot meet the challenges around the world without strong partners and allies.
Perhaps the biggest surprise from my short visit to Riyadh is that I left the conference feeling that there is hope for the future. Based on all I heard, I believe that peace between Saudi Arabia and Israel is within reach – something that creates an unprecedented opportunity to change the trajectory of relations in the region and prove Hamas’s barbaric attacks on October 7 were a fatal strategic error. You can read my official statement about my visit here, and if you are interested, you can watch my panel session here. As I write this, the world is waiting for Hamas to respond to the latest ceasefire proposal brokered by Egypt, Qatar and the United States. Secretary Blinken, speaking in Riyadh, called the deal “extraordinarily generous on the part of Israel.”  Unfortunately, the Secretary left the region on Wednesday without a response from Hamas leadership.
Meanwhile, I’ve been closely watching, with growing concern, the protests on college campuses around the country, including my alma mater Northwestern. And I am aware the protests are spreading to high schools as well.
I am and will always be a fierce advocate for and defender of free speech. I believe everyone has the right to have their say and speak their minds, no matter how vehemently I may disagree with their point of view. Freedom of speech does not, however, include the right to harass, isolate or threaten others. Nor does it allow for the violation of university rules and vandalism of campus property. 
I fully recognize and appreciate the immense sadness and pain felt and strong views held by students that identify with both sides of the conflict in Gaza. I understand that pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel advocates are deeply passionate and want their perspectives to be heard and their positions wholly adopted. And I believe there should be no better place than the college to have a robust and thoughtful debate. Sadly, instead of dialogue, we have seen too much of each side trying to drown out the other, as well as outside groups and individuals entering campus grounds to feed the flames.
I have been particularly appalled by images of many anti-Israel protestors holding rabidly antisemitic signs, chanting slogans celebrating terrorism and violence, and physically threatening and even assaulting other students. It is the responsibility of school leadership to ensure the safety and security of all students at their universities and colleges.
I’ve been extremely disappointed by the responses of many university leaders that have failed to adequately, or even minimally, protect the well-being of all students. Some schools have in fact conceded to the demands of people spewing vile, hateful, demeaning and too often antisemitic rhetoric. We need university leaders to step up and speak out against hate and discrimination, enforce their school’s rules of time, place and manner and do everything in their power to ensure healthy academic communities that allow every student to thrive, irrespective of from where they hail, to what god they pray or how they choose to identify themselves. As for those that cause physical harm to others or intentionally damage school property—schools and their leaders must make sure these individuals are held fully accountable for their behaviors.  I joined MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell Reports this week to discuss my recent trips to both Saudi Arabia and Israel, as well as campus protests – you can watch that interview here. Please keep reading to learn more about happenings in Washington and here at home. I started my week in the district by grabbing lunch at Brunch Café with Village of Deerfield Mayor Dan Shapiro and village officials Kent Street and Andrew Lichterman. I appreciated the updates on the village's economic development projects. The pain of losing a loved one to gun violence never fades. Sadly, this is a pain shared by many in our community, from Highland Park to Waukegan. I joined Lake County Leaders and victims of gun violence in Waukegan to discuss the work of the Gun Violence Prevention Initiative. The work being carried out is making a real impact in our community and serving as a model for the rest of the country. I thank the Lake County State's Attorney for helping us invest in bettering our community's safety. I was thrilled to join the Housing Opportunity Development Corporation, State Senator Julie Morrison, State Representative Bob Morgan and community members to break ground on the Zion Woods Affordable Housing Complex. This is a meaningful step toward increasing Deerfield’s affordable housing supply. Mental health is crucial for the well-being of our communities. I joined the Josselyn team in Northbrook to celebrate the kickoff of their annual capital campaign. I'm proud to support their success and work with them to eliminate barriers to mental health services. Last year, I was pleased to successfully advocate for $1 million in federal funding for the center’s new headquarters. I’m always glad to have the opportunity to visit with students and hear about what’s on their mind. I am always amazed at how tuned in to the world they are and how insightful their questions are. At the risk of being boastful, I was invited by my nephew Brady (with my niece Mia) to a town hall conversation with the entire 7th grade at Caruso Middle School. The students asked some of the smartest questions and fully engaged in a vibrant discussion. After a full hour, we all only wished we had more time together. Different day, different school-- this time at Edgewood Middle School. Once again, I was blown away by the questions and tried my best to meet the students’ high expectations. The big surprise was the last question at the end, when a student asked how I order my burritos. Based on the cheers, I am not the only one who likes brown rice, chicken, peppers, onions, lots of veggies, lettuce and cheese. Every year my office hosts students and parents from across the 10th District to learn about the application and nomination process for the five U.S. Military Service Academies, as well as opportunities for ROTC. This year we were graciously hosted by Vernon Hills High School and were honored to be joined via Zoom by Midshipman Andrew Bacilek, who I had the honor of nominating to the US Naval Academy in 2020. Andrew is a member of 13th Company and is a proud member of the class of 2024. As a Navy Dad, it is always encouraging to see so many promising and talented young people interested in serving and protecting their country, and I commend both these students and their families for their hard work and commitment. Each semester, our district and DC offices are joined by a select group of talented and enthusiastic interns who are interested in careers in public service. This semester was no exception. Throughout their time with us, Colin, Liz and Johanna all became important parts of our district team. While we will miss them at the district office, I know they are destined for bright futures ahead. I once again had the opportunity to attend the annual Lake County Mikva Challenge Issues-To-Action Showcase in Waukegan. This year’s event featured civics action projects from schools across our district. The students effectively identified issues that they are passionate about and assessed ways to have an impact around that issue. I enjoyed hearing about each of their projects, and I look forward to seeing them put their strategies into action. I ended my week in the district meeting with students from Highland Park High School and Baker College Prep at a Together Towards Peace Event at Rosewood Beach Interpretive Center.  I joined a panel discussion with Majority Leader for the IL House of Representatives Robyn Gabel, State Rep. Bob Morgan, and Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering for a broad discussion on gun violence and its impact on these students’ communities. I appreciated the opportunity to hear about their personal experiences and perspective, as well as their ideas on advocating for safe gun legislation. As we continue our work in Congress to pass gun control reform, I will for sure keep these students’ ideas in mind.    I welcomed (ret.) Henry P. (Hank) Krakowski to my office. Captain Krakowski has over forty years of aviation experience including three years as Chief Operating Officer of the Federal Aviation Administration and served in numerous positions at United Airlines. We had a great conversation on the rapidly developing zero-emission Advance Air Mobility industry and sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). I had a great time with Allendale President Jason Keeler and new team member Amir Bastanipour. We discussed Allendale’s STAR Program (Shelter & Transitional Adolescent Resources program) for runaway locked-out and homeless youth. I appreciate the work they do to support vulnerable youth; and I’m also very grateful for the plant he gifted my office. Nancy Richman, a constituent of Highland Park, dropped by to advocate for The Medicare Home Health Accessibility Act (H.R.7148). I met with Carole Rosen and other members of the Going Home Coalition and The Arc of Illinois to discuss what more can be done at the federal level to bring more awareness to disability issues. Please visit my website to find resources available for everything from saving money on your internet bill to locating your local food bank, and various help lines. And, as always, I’m happy to meet constituents in my Lincolnshire office to share ideas, discuss legislation, or catch up on what’s happening in our community. If you want to schedule a meeting with me, you can do so here. It’s NBA playoff time, but sadly the Bulls are no longer in the mix. Nevertheless, I have a basketball related story I thought might be of interest. Actually, not so much a story as an interesting comparison: Did you know that a full-grown adult blue whale, the largest animal ever to live on Planet Earth, is longer than a basketball court?!           Source: Dana Wharf Blog Blue whales are listed as endangered, with an estimated remaining population of between 5,000 and 15,000.  That’s why I was so excited to see a story about blue whales returning to the Seychelles. So many species around the world are threatened with extinction, either directly by human activities or indirectly by effects of climate change (caused by human activities). The good news is that we are learning how to successfully help many species begin to recover.
Have a wonderful weekend. Sincerely, Bradley S. Schneider

WASHINGTON— This week, the United States House of Representatives passed the Western Economic Security Today (WEST) Act. Idaho Congressman Mike Simpson—a cosponsor of the WEST Act—voted in favor of this legislation. This bill withdraws the Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM) recently finalized “Public Lands Rule” and would prevent future issuance of a substantially similar rule. The BLM’s rule is a seismic shift in public land management that upends the agency’s multiple use mandate, which has guided land management practices across the West for 50 years. “This rule will significantly impact how Idahoans interact and enjoy the 12 million acres of BLM land across the state,” said Rep. Simpson. “For decades, Idahoans have cherished the concept of multiple use on public lands and have proven to be responsible stewards. The rule jeopardizes years of successful management and collaboration by the very people who rely on our federal lands for ranching, grazing, recreation, and more. As Chairman of the House Interior and Environment Appropriations Subcommittee—which has jurisdiction over the BLM—I will continue to push back against this misguided rule.” The measure was approved with a vote of 212-202."

May 3,Brad Schneider,D,Ill.-10,10th News: CONGRESS RETURNS,"Our country is experiencing a massive shift in technology. Our daily activities often revolve around computers and smartphones.   Our Information Technology (IT) infrastructure grows daily. But so do the threats of cyberattacks.   This week, the Energy & Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight & Investigations, which I chair, held a hearing focused on the fallout from the February 2024 cyberattack on Change Healthcare.    Change Healthcare (Change), a UnitedHealth subsidiary that was acquired by them in 2022, operates the largest Electronic Data Interchange clearinghouse in the nation, transmitting more than 15 billion transactions every year.    When the hack was discovered, UnitedHealth shut down its Change Healthcare networks. This action had profound consequences for providers and patients.   According to the American Hospital Association, 94 percent of hospitals reported being financially impacted by the cyberattack. Hospitals, clinics, medical practices and pharmacies across the country were prevented from getting paid and could not submit claims. Stopping all payments on claims made it difficult for providers and patients. An unknown number of patients had their care delayed.    These consequences were widely discussed on a bipartisan basis during the hearing, which featured UnitedHealth CEO, Sir Andrew Witty.    Patients reeled from this cutoff, prompting them to either walk away, pay large sums of money out of pocket for their medications or borrow money. I am sure some had to use credit cards with high interest rates.   NBC News reported patients not being able to afford their medication without copay assistance cards, such as patients at the Marion Family Pharmacy in Marion, Virginia.   One individual was forced to pay $1,100 for medication because the Marion pharmacy was unable to process her copay assistance card.   When I raised this issue to Mr. Witty, I asked how were this lady and other people similarly situated going to be made whole for their loss. He seemed empathetic.   But it was clear to me that UnitedHealth did not have a plan on how to take care of patients who had been harmed.   He had no answer as to how much paperwork would be requested from a patient in order to be fully reimbursed. It is not just the $1,100. It’s the interest on that money that UnitedHealth got to keep and receive interest on while the patient was possibly paying interest to a lender.    There is also the possibility of increased medical attention needed for patients that were denied medicine or services because their insurance could not be processed.   I hope in the coming weeks UnitedHealth will formulate a plan for making patients whole.   Another problem is how does UnitedHealth take care of healthcare providers.    Providers were kept in the dark when claims were not being processed and sparked fears of closures. Congresswoman Schrier (D-WA) told Witty a private practitioner in her district had to mortgage their home to make office rent and payroll.    UnitedHealth “helped” them out by giving them a $70 first-round loan. Big help!   It is true the hackers were the bad guys, but as I said in my opening statement, UnitedHealth’s Change did not have Multi Factor Authentication (MFA), which is a standard cyber protection tool. The criminals exploited this weakness allowing them access into the system.   Mr. Witty attributed the technology failure to Change’s outdated system.   As the largest health care conglomerate in the United States, this response was concerning.   Over 50 percent of U.S. medical claims are processed through Change’s EDI clearinghouse. UnitedHealth Group’s vast network encompasses Optum, Optum Rx pharmacies, urgent care centers, United Healthcare Medicare and Retirement plans, including AARP Medicare plans, 10,000 doctors and other subsidiaries.   Given UnitedHealth’s sweeping consolidation of medical companies, the company stands as a prime target for bad actors.   It begs the question whether one company should be able to control a market share of this magnitude in the healthcare arena.   I do not claim to know the answer, but the question must be asked.   UnitedHealth had an obligation to protect their customers. They failed! And they failed to have a secure backup plan.    Small medical practices and hospitals are hurting. But the most vulnerable to this incident were the people showing up at their healthcare provider needing care and at their pharmacy needing to get their medicine.   UnitedHealth has a big mess to clean up. Going forward, my Subcommittee will examine their actions and then we can determine if UnitedHealth is truly committed to rectifying their mistake.    If you have questions, concerns, or comments, feel free to contact my office.  You can call my Abingdon office at 276-525-1405 or my Christiansburg office at 540-381-5671.  To reach my office via email, please visit my website at https://morgangriffith.house.gov.     ### Enter your email address to get the latest updates straight to your inbox.

May 3,Brad Schneider,D,Ill.-10,"10th News: MAYBE, JUST MAYBE CONGRESS WILL","U.S. Congressman Washington, D.C. - Congressman Michael C. Burgess, M.D. (R-TX), Chairman of the Rules Committee, testified at the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee on what Congress can do to address the severe shortage of minority health care professionals and the maternal health crisis.  Click HERE for video. Remarks as prepared, below: Chair Sanders, Ranking Member Cassidy, and members of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, thank you for the opportunity to speak at today’s hearing. I am Representative Michael C. Burgess from Texas’ 26th District. Before coming to Congress, I dedicated nearly three decades to practicing medicine in Texas. Between myself, my grandfather, and my father combined we have practiced medicine for nearly the whole of the twentieth century. Practicing medicine can be very complex. However, I chose obstetrics since there is almost always a satisfactory result. I spent time in residency as an OB-GYN at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, Texas. Statistically, Parkland had some of the best outcomes in the country due to its emphasis on proper care and attention of patients. At the time, I remember the Chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology pointed out that the practice of obstetrics is unique in medicine, and those privileged enough to continue were going to be charged with taking care of two patients with a combined life expectancy of 100 years. Nowhere else in medicine does one have the ability to do that.  The patient population near Parkland often came from both rural and urban communities in Dallas. In my time, the clientele was multi-ethnic, largely uninsured, or underinsured. Throughout my career, I have delivered over 3,000 babies and treated patients who had suffered from miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies, stillbirths, sickle cell, and other life-threatening conditions. Whether my responsibility was to step in and deliver a baby, or save a life, it was done without hesitation. For this reason, I’ve spent my career trying to increase access to quality health care for patients, both through my experience as a physician and as a legislator.  In 2005, I became aware of the rising infant mortality rates in Southeast Fort Worth. Despite the challenges, it took several years of concerted effort, but eventually, I successfully established a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) with a pediatric unit. Remarkably, the center was opened through a longstanding collaboration with the Democratic County Commissioner and Mayor of Fort Worth. It was my experience, expertise, and passion in maternal health care that led me to championing this issue in Congress as well as other health issues aimed at improving health disparities.  The alarming trend in our country’s rate of maternal mortality first came to my attention in September of 2018, when I was reading my copy of the Green Journal. The original research cited in the journal stated that maternal mortality rates increased in Texas between 2011 and 2012. The new study found that the number of maternal deaths in Texas in 2012 was less than half the number previously reported.  The peer-reviewed research, published in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology, determined there were 56 maternal deaths among Texas residents compared with 147 reported in national statistics. Later on, it was released that the state overcounted the deaths due to a new method of how Texas was reporting data that was different than other states. This retraction of the study made disputes over the statistics the subject of national news coverage as opposed to the lives that need saving.   I believe that any maternal death is one too many. It is important that we capture these deaths accurately to understand the scope of maternal mortality in the United States and have a better understanding of how to address them. In combination, we cannot legislate good practice, but we can provide the tools to be able to come up with best practices and increase access to maternity care. These critical points have influenced my policy work during my time as a legislator.  Throughout the years, I have worked across the aisle on several pieces of legislation that became law, including H.R. 315 The Improving Access to Maternity Care Act and H.R. 4387 The Maternal Health Quality Improvement Act. Additionally, I am currently a lead sponsor of H.R. 3838 The Preventing Maternal Deaths Reauthorization Act, H.R. 7432 The Sickle Disease Comprehensive Care Act, and H.R. 3226 The PREEMIE Reauthorization Act of 2023. In the past, I have led critical reauthorizations of Title VII Health Professional Education and Training Programs to increase access to health care in underserved areas and diversify the health care workforce. I also worked on H.R. 5395 The Expanding Connectivity for Health Outcomes Act (ECHO) Act, which promoted connection between primary care providers and specialists, increasing access to specialty care for underserved communities.  Part of the goal of H.R. 3838 was to establish Maternal Mortality Review Committees (MMRCs). These multidisciplinary committees review the causes of maternal deaths in their state or other localities and make recommendations based on their findings to prevent future deaths and improve maternal health outcomes during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period. Through my work on this legislation, Maternal Mortality Review Committees were able to discover that 53% of pregnancy-related deaths happen between seven days and one-year post-partum, leading to the critical extension of the state plan amendment for Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) 12-month post-partum coverage. This year, effective March 1st, 2024, Texas extended postpartum coverage to the full 12 months for eligible Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) recipients through the Texas Health and Human Services Commission.  I cannot stress enough the importance of continuing bipartisan work to reduce disparities and improve outcomes, as well as bolster our public health workforce. Throughout the years, I’ve developed great working relationships with members such as Reps. Lisa Blunt Rochester, Robin Kelly, and Danny Davis. It is through these great partnerships that we influence and expand our understanding of health care policy in the nation. With that knowledge, it is my belief that Congress should examine the effectiveness of our existing programs and determine what changes may be necessary to achieve these goals. Congress has an important role, but so do community/physician-led efforts. The work of Congress should be informed by what’s happening on the ground. It is our passion and work that define who we are and leave a lasting imprint on Capitol Hill, shaping policies, building relationships, and fostering change that impacts the lives of countless American patients.  Thank you for having me today and for holding this hearing on such important topics. It has been a privilege to discuss my work and experience with you.    ### Get the most up to date news from me on Twitter."
May 3,Brad Schneider,D,Ill.-10,"10th News: Happy Passover, Bipartisanship in DC, and Celebrating a Local Hero","I condemn the remarks of Prime Minister Netanyahu and the rhetoric of Israel’s far-right government leaders who want to deny Palestinians the right to a state. I first called for a bilateral ceasefire in November, and I am continuing to do so because the temporary ceasefire agreement that allowed for the return of some hostages was not enough. A renewed ceasefire could allow for the safe release of all hostages, save lives, and facilitate assistance for the growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. I continue to mourn the loss of Israeli and Palestinian lives and agonize about the horrors of terrorism and war. The U.S. must continue to engage diplomatically to remove Hamas from power, end the ongoing violence in the region, and advocate for peace through a two-state solution."
May 3,Brad Schneider,D,Ill.-10,10th News: A Week at Home and a Weekend in the Middle East,"WASHINGTON — This week, Congressman Patrick McHenry (NC-10) was recognized as a Fiscal Hero of the 118th Congress by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Congressman McHenry was the architect of H.R.3746, the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, which secured historic spending cuts, the largest funding rescissions in history, and pro-growth regulatory reforms for the first time in a debt ceiling negotiation.
 ""There is more work to be done to rein in federal spending and secure our economic future,"" said Congressman McHenry. ""However, we took a significant step forward with the passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act. I am proud of my work on this legislation and my work throughout my time in Congress to lower spending. I appreciate the recognition for my efforts."" 

Maya MacGuineas, President of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and head of Fix the Debt, had the following to say:

“Fiscal responsibility is a stewardship, not only for Americans today but for generations of Americans to come. We applaud this year’s Fiscal Heroes, including Representative McHenry, for having the courage to prioritize our fiscal health and work towards achieving a more sustainable debt trajectory. Through legislation, speeches, engagement back home, and tough political decisions, these Members of Congress have distinguished themselves as leaders on these key issues, and we are honored to recognize and applaud them for their efforts. We look forward to seeing how these Fiscal Heroes will build on the momentum in the past year to make even greater strides going forward.”

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget is a nonpartisan, non-profit organization committed to educating the public on issues with significant fiscal policy impact.  "

Barragn Statement on Biden Administration Announcing $3 Billion in Funding to Replace Lead Pipes,"May 2, 2024 Finalized HHS Rules Advances Equity, Bolsters Protections For People With Disabilities Under Section 504 Of The Rehabilitation Act Pressley Has Long Urged Admin. to Improve Access to Healthcare for Folks with Disabilities WASHINGTON – Today, Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) issued a statement applauding the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) finalized rule that prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability. This rule, titled Discrimination on the Basis of Disability in Health and Human Service Programs or Activities, advances equity and bolsters protections for people with disabilities under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (Section 504). Rep. Pressley has been a longtime champion for the disability community and recently wrote to the Biden Harris Administration urging the Administration to improve access to healthcare for folks with disabilities. “The unjust status quo has subjected our neighbors with disabilities to daily injustices,” said Congresswoman Pressley. “This much-needed and long-overdue rule is a historic step forward that will help prevent discrimination for folks with disabilities and help them access healthcare and other services they need and deserve. I’m grateful to Secretary Becerra and the Biden-Harris Administration for heeding advocates’ calls and look forward to working with them to further advance disability justice at the federal level.” Reflecting over fifty years of advocacy by the disability community, the Section 504 Final Rule clarifies and strengthens civil rights protections for people with disabilities, addresses discrimination in medical treatment, adds enforceable standards for accessible medical diagnostic equipment, and ensures accessible web content and mobile apps. The rule advances the promise of the Rehabilitation Act and helps protect people with disabilities from experiencing discrimination in any program or activity receiving funding from HHS because of their disability. Section 504 prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in programs and activities that receive funding from HHS. Since the law was enacted, major legislative and judicial developments have shifted the legal landscape of disability discrimination under Section 504. More information about the finalized rule is available here. Rep. Pressley has been a longtime advocate the disability community and has championed policies that promote disability justice. ### Washington DC Office 402 Cannon HOB

May 3,Michael C. Burgess,R,Tex.-26,Burgess Receives Texas Medical Association's Distinguished Service Award,"May 2, 2024 CROWN Act Has Already Been Enacted In 23 States and Dozens Of Cities Nationwide Text of Bill (PDF) | Press Conference (YouTube) WASHINGTON – Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) joined Representatives Bonnie Watson Coleman (NJ-12), Barbara Lee (CA-13), Ilhan Omar (MN-05), Gwen Moore (WI-04), Summer Lee (PA-12) and Maxwell Frost (FL-10) to announce the reintroduction of the Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair (CROWN) Act in the House of Representatives, a bill to outlaw discrimination on the basis of hair texture. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) also announced reintroduction of the CROWN Act in the Senate.  The lawmakers unveiled the legislation at a Capitol Hill press conference. Full video of the press conference is available here. “It is 2024 and discrimination against natural hair continues to disrupt our lives. No one should have the right to punish Black folks for showing up as our full, authentic selves – not in Massachusetts, Texas, or anywhere else,” said Rep. Ayanna Pressley. “We need a federal CROWN Act now more than ever. Whether you are a student in a classroom, an employee in the workplace, or the next Supreme Court Justice, you belong everywhere as you are. I am proud to join my sisters-in-service in reintroducing this crucial legislation to end race-based hair discrimination in America once and for all.” “Our hair plays a significant role in our overall well-being, self-esteem, cultural identity, and personal expression,” said Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman. “Discrimination against Black hair is discrimination against Black people. And we’re going to put a stop to it. I’m grateful to the broad coalition that has developed to pass this legislation and look forward to working with them to ensure everyone can live as their authentic selves.” “Nobody should face harassment or discrimination based on their natural hair, and the CROWN Act is an effort to heal a systemic bias that tells Black people that who they inherently are is wrong,” said Senator Booker. “Prejudice against Black hair demeans an important foundation of our identity and cultural heritage. It’s time that the long and storied history of implicit and explicit biases against natural hair comes to an end. Black hair is beautiful in all of its forms and styles, and we must ensure individuals are free to express their cultural identities without fear of prejudice or bias.” “There is a longstanding history of racial discrimination against natural hair and protective styles in the workplace, schools, and society at large. Purportedly race-neutral grooming policies that reinforce Eurocentric standards of beauty and myopic notions of what constitute professional hair are problematic. To that end, since 2018, I have worked tirelessly to pass the CROWN Act and shift culture to mitigate the physical, psychological, and economic harm caused by race-based hair discrimination,” said Dr. Adjoa B. Asamoah who is the scholar and strategist leading the nationwide CROWN Act movement. “We must work collectively to protect our children, like Darryl George, and ensure they have positive educational experiences. I am grateful for the partnership and leadership of Congresswoman Watson Coleman and Senator Booker.” “I am proud to stand with my colleagues Rep. Watson Coleman, Rep. Pressley, Rep. Omar, and Rep. Moore to reintroduce the CROWN Act,” said Rep. Barbara Lee. “Hair discrimination is rooted in systemic racism and is a real barrier to advancement and empowerment for people of color.  For far too long, GOP dysfunction has blocked this legislation, but we will not relent until Black people can wear their natural hair however they see fit, without fear of discrimination. No one should feel forced to change who they are in order to secure a job or fair and decent housing.” “Hair discrimination is a reality that Black people face daily across America – in schools, workplaces, and public spaces,” said Rep. Ilhan Omar. “Natural hair textures and protective styles have unfairly subjected people to discrimination, missed opportunities, and humiliation. The CROWN Act draws a firm line, making it crystal clear that this form of race-based discrimination will not be tolerated. No one deserves to be judged or held back because of their hair texture or cultural hairstyle.” “In our country, Black women’s hair is 2.5x more likely to be perceived as unprofessional and over 20% of Black women have been sent home from work because of their hair. A student in my former PA House District was once told ‘change your hair or go home,’” said Rep. Summer Lee. “I was proud to introduce the CROWN Act during my time in Pennsylvania, and look forward to taking this fight in Congress–because it’s long past time to make respect for our beautiful Black hair the law of the land in this country.” “It’s 2024 and Black hair is still criminalized,” said Rep. Gwen Moore. “We need the CROWN Act to affirm that any person – no matter their hair texture or style – should be free to wear their hair as it grows out of their head without facing discrimination at work or school. I’m proud to wear my sister locs in Congress and I’m excited to partner on this bill with so many of my trailblazing colleagues.” “I applaud Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman and Senator Cory Booker for their leadership in reintroducing the CROWN Act to bring forward necessary change,” said Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus Steven Horsford. “For too long, race-based hair discrimination, which permeates every part of our society from the workplace to the classroom, has been historically used to shut off access to educational and employment opportunities for Black Americans. Students like Darryl George in Anahuac, Texas should not be barred from his classroom, and Black women all over our country should not be forced to change their hair to be accepted in the workplace. We must pass the CROWN Act on the national level to finally outlaw race-based hair discrimination.” “Racial discrimination can come in many different shapes and forms, with hair discrimination chief among them,” said Rep. Maxwell Frost. “No one should be discriminated against because of the color of their skin or the texture of their hair — but that’s exactly what’s happening in our country. In schools, in places of business, and beyond, folks with textured hair, mainly Black men and women, are finding themselves with the doors of opportunity closed to them simply because of their natural hair. Enough is enough. I’m proud to help introduce the CROWN Act alongside Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman to help us bring an end to this discrimination.” The CROWN Act, which has already been enacted in 23 states and dozens of cities nationwide, would help bring an end to race-based hair discrimination in schools and workplaces, removing a barrier to educational and economic opportunity facing many Black Americans and people of color. In the school setting, Black students are disciplined at a rate four times higher than any other racial or ethnic group, and research has found that 70 percent of all suspension disciplines are discretionary, many stemming from dress code violations, including “unapproved” hair styles. Meanwhile, in the workplace, bias against ethnic and natural hairstyles contributes to reduced opportunities for job advancement, particularly for women. Over 20% of young Black women have been sent home from work because of their hair. One-third of Black women under 34 believe they have been denied a job interview because of their hair. The CROWN Act passed the House of Representatives in 2019 and 2022 but was blocked in the Senate. The CROWN Act would: “Bravo to Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman for reintroducing the CROWN Act, which seeks to undo generations of systemic hair discrimination that’s done immeasurable harm to so many individuals,” said SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher. “It’s time to end these discriminatory practices. I applaud lawmakers who push for the real change necessary to achieve equity in the workplace and public schools. An acceptance of the diversity of the human experience will be the greatest step towards peace on earth.” “As an advocate for equality and fairness in all aspects of society, APFA proudly endorses the CROWN Act, or the Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair Act,” said Julie Hedrick, National President of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA). “The CROWN Act aims to end race-based discrimination because of hair texture or protective hairstyles. While already passed in some states and municipalities, the bill would provide critical federal-level protection for individuals who might otherwise be judged or penalized based on their natural hair texture or style. Flight Attendants, like all individuals, deserve a work environment free from bias and discrimination. APFA commends Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, representing the 12th district of New Jersey, for introducing the CROWN Act and we look forward to advocating for its passage. Together, we can work towards a future where everyone, regardless of their hairstyle, can feel valued, respected, and accepted in both the workplace and beyond.”“No one should be punished, harassed, or discriminated against for wearing a hairstyle that is reflective of themselves and their cultural heritage,” said Denise Forte, President and CEO of EdTrust. “Yet many Black students routinely face disciplinary consequences for their natural or ethnic hairstyles: 53% of Black mothers say their daughters experienced hair discrimination by age five; and 86% of Black teens state they experienced hair discrimination by age 12. For example, a Houston-area high school student has been suspended since last August because of his locs. In a lawsuit, a Texas judge ruled in favor of the school district, further codifying natural hair discrimination and shamelessly upholding standards of white supremacy. The CROWN Act would help bring an end to race-based hair discrimination and allow for a more supportive school environment for students of color — particularly Black students, who bear the brunt of hair criminalization.” “All students, no matter their race or place, deserve equal access to educational opportunities,” said National Education Association President Becky Pringle. “They deserve the right to be their true authentic selves without fear of subjective discipline or body shaming. However, too often, the same politicians who ban books and demonize transgender students want to tell Black girls what to wear and Black kids how to wear their hair. This small group of people in power is threatening the success of our students in school and beyond with their anti-Black hair policies. The National Education Association applauds the introduction of the CROWN Act because it acknowledges that people of color in K-12 public schools, workplaces, housing, and public accommodations face hair-based discrimination, and the legislation creates consequences for those who are responsible for it. More to the point, we welcome the proposal’s attempt to expand federal protections to end hair discrimination nationwide. By joining across race and place, we can create real change and contribute to the movement to end hair discrimination and to ensure every student has access to a safe, welcoming public school free from discrimination where they can thrive into their brilliant selves.” In addition to Reps. Ayanna Pressley, Barbara Lee, Ilhan Omar, Gwen Moore, Summer Lee, and Maxwell Alejandro Frost, the CROWN Act is cosponsored by Reps. Robin Kelly, Yvette Clarke, Adam Schiff, Adam Smith, Adriano Espaillat, Al Green, Alma Adams, Andre Carson, Bennie G. Thompson, Bobby Scott, Colin Allred, Cori Bush, Dan Goldman, Danny K.

May 2,Steve Womack,R,Ark.-3,"Womack, Fellow Appropriators, State and Federal Officials Survey Key Bridge and Port Recovery Response","May 2, 2024 Text of Letter (PDF) WASHINGTON – Today, Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) joined Representatives Pramila Jayapal (WA-07), Madeleine Dean (PA-04) and 54 additional lawmakers in calling on the Biden Administration to use all tools possible to dissuade the Israeli government from moving forward with an offensive invasion into Rafah.  “We write with urgency to say: an offensive invasion into Rafah by Israel in the upcoming days is wholly unacceptable,” wrote the Members. “Despite […] dire circumstances, the Israeli government is reportedly on the verge of a full-scale offensive on Rafah. An Israeli offensive in Rafah risks the start of yet another escalatory spiral, immediately putting the region back on the brink of a broader war that neither Israel nor the United States can afford.” Before the horrific October 7th terrorist attack by Hamas on Israel, 280,000 Palestinians lived in Rafah. Now roughly 1.4 million people are sheltering in Rafah after being displaced. This dire humanitarian situation has been exacerbated by hindered access to food, water, and medicine in the Gaza Strip. “We urge you to invoke existing law and policy to immediately withhold certain offensive military aid to the Israeli government, including aid sourced from legislation already signed into law, in order to preempt a full-scale assault on Rafah,” continued the Members. “If the Israeli government will not uphold international law and protect civilians, then the United States must act to protect innocent life. We urge you to continue your work toward achieving a lasting ceasefire that will bring hostages home and build a path toward safety and security for all.” The letter was also signed by Becca Balint (VT-At Large), Nanette Barragán (CA-44), Donald S.

Pressley delivered a floor speech in which she called for urgent de-escalation in the Middle East and renewed her calls for a ceasefire in Gaza and Israel to prevent a broader regional war.

May 3,Hakeem Jeffries,D,N.Y.-8,LEADER JEFFRIES STATEMENT ON THE APRIL JOBS REPORT,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: May 2, 2024 MEDIA CONTACT:  e: brian.phillips@mail.house.gov c: 202.913.0126 Washington, D.C. — Today, Congresswoman Yvette D. Clarke (NY-09) released the following statement regarding her vote against H.R.6090, the Antisemitism Awareness Act: “There is a dire need to address the vile antisemitism confronting Jewish Americans across our nation, and Congress has a duty to pursue legislative solutions centered in their safety and ability to live peacefully and without fear. But the Antisemitism Awareness Act is no such answer. This inherently divisive bill not only undermines President Biden’s comprehensive and proven National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism, but creates dangerous opportunities for bad actors to attack free speech on an unprecedented scale. Make no mistake: Congress must take the rising scourge of antisemitism seriously and deliver decisive results that confront this crisis of hatred head on. Political ploys and patronization will never be the path forward. While the president’s strategy continues to deliver tangible differences in Jewish lives, Congress must pass meaningful legislation like the Countering Antisemitism Act that complements and supports President Biden’s work – not impede it at every turn.” ###

With over 35,000 Palestinians and 1,200 Israelis killed, over 100 hostages still held captive by Hamas, and millions at risk of starvation in Gaza, a lasting, bilateral ceasefire to save lives, release all hostages, and deliver the life-saving humanitarian aid that Gaza needs is essential.” Since the horrific October 7th attack, Congresswoman Pressley has consistently and stridently called for a bilateral ceasefire to save lives, return all hostages, and surge humanitarian aid to Gaza.

May 3,Michael C. Burgess,R,Tex.-26,Burgess Testifies at the Senate HELP Committee on the Maternal Health Crisis,"            The following are excerpts of remarks by Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ), Co-Chair of the House Task Force for Combating Antisemitism, during today’s debate on the House Floor on the Antisemitism Awareness Act (HR 6090)—legislation aimed at combating antisemitism on college campuses:             “Forty-two years ago, my first human rights trip as a congressman was to the Soviet Union to defend Jews against pernicious antisemitism.             I never thought, however, that the antisemitic hate I saw in Moscow and Leningrad could ever happen here.             But it has. And it’s escalating.             The bigotry, intolerance, prejudice—the unbridled hatred for Jews and the nation of Israel—exploding on American college campuses today is absolutely disgraceful.             It is morally impermissible—and illegal—that Jewish students are the targets of antisemitic hate and violence.              In both word and deed, Hamas is a terrorist organization that commits mass murder of Jews and seeks the evisceration of Israel.             Don’t believe it? Remember the horrific violence of October 7th and the ongoing ordeal of the hostages. Or just read the Hamas Charter of 1988, the blueprint for genocide against the Jews—a modern-day Nazi-like final solution.             As co-chair of the House Bipartisan Task Force for Combatting Antisemitism, I want to thank my good friends and colleagues Mike Lawler and Josh Gottheimer for authoring the Antisemitism Awareness Act.              This important legislation will codify the IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism into Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the landmark anti-discrimination law. Schools that receive federal funds must comply with Title VI, and this bill will clarify that the Hamas hatred infecting our campuses must be dealt with as antisemitic discrimination that violates civil rights.             Special thanks to the police, who at great risk to their own personal safety, are trying to mitigate the threats to Jewish students.” ### Chris has three offices dedicated to constituent services.

Donald Norcross (D-NJ), a co-sponsor of the Antisemitism Awareness Act, released the following statement after the legislation passed the House of Representatives with bipartisan support:   “We have seen a disturbing and unacceptable rise in antisemitic rhetoric and anti-Jewish incidents since the horrific October 7 attack by Hamas on innocent Israeli civilians. The dangerous antisemitic speech and actions manifesting around the country only promote hatred, violence, and fear. It must not be tolerated or accepted now or ever.   “From college campuses to local communities, everyone, including our Jewish brothers and sisters, has a right to be safe in their places of work, their schools, homes, and neighborhoods. Their safety begins with the bipartisan Antisemitism Awareness Act, which I am proud to co-sponsor. The bill passed by the House today will strengthen federal anti-discrimination laws with respect to antisemitism and improve safety and security for Jewish communities in South Jersey and across the country.   “Congress sent a message to the nation today that we will not be silent or idle at a time when antisemitism and hatred is rearing its ugly head across our nation. We must and we will continue to stand against all forms of hatred, bigotry, and antisemitism. I will continue to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and at all levels of government to ensure South Jersey and our country remains safe and inclusive for all.”   Background Information More information on the Antisemitism Awareness Act of 2023 can be found here.   Las week, Rep. Norcross released a statement on the pro-Palestinian walkout at Eastern Regional High School in Voorhees, New Jersey. He also voted in support of the $26.4 billion security package to Israel in April. Rep. Norcross was a part of the first congressional delegation visit to Israel in the days following the October 7 attack.   Rep. Norcross, Sen. Ernst, and a bipartisan, bicameral congressional delegation traveled to the Middle East in early January to reaffirm support for Israel, meet with regional officials and partners about challenges, and advocate for the safe and secure return of U.S. citizens taken hostage by Hamas. He also led an op-ed with Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) on the important role that Congress has in bringing the hostages home.   In March, Rep. Norcross welcomed Yael Alexander, the mother of New Jerseyan Edan Alexander who remains held hostage by Hamas, as his State of the Union guest to highlight the continued hostage crisis.   Permalink: https://norcross.house.gov/2024/5/rep-norcross-bipartisan-antisemitism-awareness-act-passes-house-will-strengthen-federal-anti-discrimination-laws-and-fight-against-hatred"
May 3,Patrick T. McHenry,R,N.C.-10,McHenry Recognized as a Fiscal Hero of the 118th Congress,"Washington, DC—May 1, 2024…Congressman Steve Womack (AR-3) released the following statement after voting for H.R. 6090, the Antisemitism Awareness Act:
 Congressman Womack said, “It infuriates me to see people cloaking themselves in our constitution while demeaning it with their actions. Pro-terror, antisemitic mobs have no place in this country. Yet we have seen the leadership at American universities cede to these radical mobs rather than honor their responsibility to ensure the safety and educational opportunities for students. The passage of this bill today is a step forward in combatting antisemitism on our college campuses and holding those who participate in political violence accountable.” Bill breakdown: H.R. 6090 seeks to combat the pro-terrorist, antisemitic protests taking over American college campuses by requiring the Department of Education to utilize the 2016 International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s (IHRA) definition of antisemitism and its contemporary examples when reviewing, investigating, or determining whether discrimination has occurred. It further expresses the sense of Congress that discrimination against Jews may violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 when it is based on race, color, or national origin, which can include discrimination based on actual or perceived shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics.

May 2,Christopher H. Smith,R,N.J.-4,Liberian President Boakai signs executive order to establish War Crimes & Economic Crimes Court,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: May 1, 2024 MEDIA CONTACT:  e: brian.phillips@mail.house.gov c: 202.913.0126 Washington, D.C. — Today, Congresswoman Yvette D. Clarke (NY-09) and Senator Peter Welch (D-VT) released the below statement following the final notice from FCC Chairwoman Rosenworcel on the nationwide impact of the official wind down of the Affordable Connectivity Program. “For over two years, the ACP has provided tens of millions of Americans in every corner of our nation with reliable, high-speed broadband at a price they can afford. According to the FCC, nearly 70 percent of these households had no or very limited internet access before the ACP. The end of this program would have devastating consequences. No family should have to choose between putting food on the table and having internet access essential for modern life. Congress must act swiftly, and pass the bipartisan Affordable Connectivity Program Extension Act. Lives, jobs, and futures are on the line. Congress must act now to protect this program – before it’s too late,” said Rep. Clarke. “Access to high-speed internet has become a necessity in our everyday lives, from scheduling doctors’ appointments, to attending class, and doing your job. But for too many households, the cost of high-speed broadband has prevented them from getting connected,” said Senator Welch, Member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Technology. “In the two years since its creation, the ACP has been instrumental in helping nearly 23 million households including families, students, veterans, and seniors stay connected to their work, school, and doctors. But right now, we’re at the end of the line–Congress must pass our bipartisan Affordable Connectivity Program Extension Act to prevent millions of people across the country from falling into digital darkness.” The Affordable Connectivity Program Extension Act was introduced by Reps. Clarke and Fitzpatrick (PA-01) who were joined by original cosponsors Reps. Michael Lawler (NY-17), Norma Torres (CA-35), Anthony D’Esposito (NY-04), Debbie Dingell (MI-6), Darren Soto (FL-9), and Marc Molinaro (NY-19), along with 217 additional cosponsors. U.S. Senators Peter Welch (D-Vt.) and JD Vance (R-Ohio) are leading the legislation in the Senate. The Affordable Connectivity Program Extension Act is supported by over 400 organizations, including: AARP, American Civil Liberties Union, AT&T, Charter, Comcast, Communications Workers of America, Cox Communications, CTIA – The Wireless Association, INCOMPAS, NAACP, NCTA – The Internet & Television Association, NTCA – The Rural Broadband Association, T-Mobile, USTelecom, Verizon, Wireless Infrastructure Association, and WTA – Advocates for Rural Broadband. Read more about the bill here and see state-by-state data on the ACP here. Due to a lack of funding, the Federal Communications Commission began winding down the program in January 2024. April was the last month households received the full $30 discount. In May, some may receive a partial discount, but without action from Congress, the ACP will end after May 2024. The Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) is a lifeline for millions, but its future hangs in the balance. According to the FCC, below is a snapshot of its impact – and the communities that stand to lose the most if funding isn’t secured: ###

May 2,Bill Huizenga,R,Mich.-4,Huizenga Named Fiscal Hero by Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget,"May 1, 2024 WASHINGTON – Today, Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) issued the following statement on the Biden Administration’s approval of student loan discharge for 317,000 borrowers who attended The Art Institutes, including over 3,500 borrowers in Massachusetts:  “No student should be left in the lurch because they were scammed by their college or university,” said Congresswoman Pressley. “I’m glad the Biden-Harris Administration, thanks to the leadership of Governor Healey and Attorney General Campbell, are taking action to make these Massachusetts borrowers whole and deliver the life-changing and life-saving student debt cancellation they need and deserve.” “Millions of students, including thousands of Massachusetts students, were taken advantage of by The Art Institutes and had their financial futures threatened,” said Governor Maura Healey. “I’m glad to see the Biden-Harris Administration provide billions of dollars in relief to borrowers and proud of the work of the Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office that contributed to this result. This will be transformative for these students’ lives and benefit our economy as a whole.” Rep. Pressley has been a leading voice in Congress urging President Biden to cancel student debt. Following years of advocacy by Rep. Pressley—in partnership with colleagues, borrowers, and advocates—the Biden-Harris Administration announced a historic plan to cancel student debt that stands to benefit over 40 million people. ### Washington DC Office 402 Cannon HOB

May 2,Ayanna Pressley,D,Mass.-7,"Pressley, Watson Coleman, Booker, Colleagues Reintroduce CROWN Act to Fight Race-Based Hair Discrimination","WASHINGTON – U.S. Representatives Pramila Jayapal (WA-07), Madeleine Dean (PA-04) and 55 additional Members are calling on the Administration to use all tools possible to dissuade the Israeli government from moving forward with an offensive invasion into Rafah.  “We write with urgency to say: an offensive invasion into Rafah by Israel in the upcoming days is wholly unacceptable,” wrote the Members. “Despite […] dire circumstances, the Israeli government is reportedly on the verge of a full-scale offensive on Rafah. An Israeli offensive in Rafah risks the start of yet another escalatory spiral, immediately putting the region back on the brink of a broader war that neither Israel nor the United States can afford.” Before the horrific October 7th terrorist attacks by Hamas on Israel, 280,000 Palestinians lived in Rafah. Now roughly 1.4 million people are sheltering in Rafah after being displaced. This overcrowding has caused further suffering through scarcity of food, water, and medicine.  “We urge you to invoke existing law and policy to immediately withhold certain offensive military aid to the Israeli government, including aid sourced from legislation already signed into law, in order to preempt a full-scale assault on Rafah,” continued the Members. “If the Israeli government will not uphold international law and protect civilians, then the United States must act to protect innocent life. We urge you to continue your work toward achieving a lasting ceasefire that will bring hostages home and build a path toward safety and security for all.” The letter was also signed by Becca Balint (VT-At Large), Nanette Barragán (CA-44), Donald S.

May 2,Ayanna Pressley,D,Mass.-7,"Pressley Joins Jayapal, Dean, 50+ Lawmakers Calling on Admin. to Help Prevent Assault on Rafah","CHERRY HILL, NJ – Today, Rep. Donald Norcross (D-NJ) released the following statement on the planned pro-Palestinian walkout at Eastern Regional High School in Voorhees, New Jersey:   “I believe it is the appropriate decision for Eastern High School to cancel the ""pro-Palestinian walkout"" on its grounds during Passover. Regardless of one's position on the current conflict in Gaza, the timing of the walkout was antagonistic and unnecessary. Many of our Jewish friends and neighbors in New Jersey have ties to Israel and lost loved ones in the October 7th massacre. The planned walkout would have undoubtedly exacerbated the pain of the Jewish community - which includes many students, faculty, and staff at Eastern High School.     “It cannot go without saying that while I understand the significant concerns about the ongoing loss of life in Gaza, the fact is that Hamas is solely responsible for it. Not only did these terrorists attack Israel, killing children and raping women, but the group also continues to hold 133 Israeli hostages and has repeatedly rejected proposals to release them in exchange for a ceasefire. At the same time, Hamas leadership promises to attack Israel again if it is able and continues to use a mantra of ‘death to Jews.’   “I am also concerned about the dark turn much of the public rhetoric has taken. Too many of our Jewish neighbors not only feel threatened - they have been threatened. That is unacceptable. Antisemitic rhetoric and actions cannot be allowed and speech that causes fear and promotes hate based on identity or religion should never be embraced, especially in our public schools. It is encouraging that this event was reconsidered and I urge everyone to find ways to support all our students.”   Rep. Norcross was a part of the first congressional delegation visit to Israel in the days following the October 7 attack.   Rep. Norcross, Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA), and a bipartisan, bicameral congressional delegation returned to the Middle East in early January to reaffirm support for Israel, meet with regional officials and partners about challenges, and advocate for the safe and secure return of U.S. citizens taken hostage by Hamas.

May 1,Donald W. Norcross,D,N.J.-1,"Rep. Norcross Bipartisan Antisemitism Awareness Act Passes House, Will Strengthen Federal Anti-Discrimination Laws and Fight Against Hatred","Subscribe to receive the latest news, insights, and updates directly to your inbox. WASHINGTON, DC – Yesterday, as National Minority Health Month concluded, Congresswoman Kathy Castor (FL-14), co-chair of the Congressional Academic Medicine Caucus, and Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (OH-03), co-chair of the Congressional Black Caucus’ Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Task Force, introduced a resolution recognizing the importance of DEI in medical education. The resolution affirms the need for a health care workforce that mirrors the nation’s diverse patient populations to advance health equity throughout the United States. To that end, the resolution commits to supporting DEI programs and academic freedom at medical education institutions. Unequal access to quality medical services, treatment, and preventive measures has led to significant disparities in health outcomes, life expectancy, and overall well-being among racial and ethnic groups. As a result, certain communities face higher rates of health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and asthma. Ample evidence suggests that diversity at medical schools, and therefore in the field of medicine, increases access to care for medically underserved communities and improves patient-provider interactions and quality of care.  The historical lack of diversity in medicine underscores the need for DEI initiatives. A recent survey by the Association of American Medical Colleges revealed that only 7% of practicing U.S. physicians identified as Hispanic and 6% as Black or African American. Therefore, the resolution promotes efforts to foster diversity at medical education institutions and strongly opposes legislative measures that threaten these efforts. “The health and well-being of all Americans depends on medical professionals who understand and respond to the needs of their diverse patients. Understanding biases, racial discrimination, and historic barriers to diagnosis and care are vital parts of medical education and training today. A highly-competent and diverse health care workforce helps avoid mistreatment and close the gaps in health disparities,” said Congresswoman Castor. “As Co-Chair of the Congressional Academic Medicine Caucus, I value graduate medical physician training that emphasizes culturally-competent care for patients from a variety of backgrounds so that patients feel respected, safe and understood, and receive the high quality care they need. Rep. Beatty’s strong leadership in support of a robust and diverse medical workforce is vital at a time when some seek to dismiss the role that diversity, equity and inclusion play in positive patient outcomes and the quality of health care delivered.” “Attempts to stymie diversity in medical education and training prioritize intolerance over innovation and only serve to worsen the health disparities that persist in this country. This tactic legislates a political narrative instead of engaging in an evidence-based debate, suppressing meaningful academic discourse and perpetuating systemic barriers to health equity,” said Congresswoman Beatty. “Research has conclusively proven that diversity in medicine leads directly to greater access to health care and better health outcomes for all Americans. With the endorsement of several medical organizations, I am proud to introduce this resolution alongside Congresswoman Castor to unequivocally support, defend, and embrace diversity, equity, and inclusion in medical education in the face of baseless efforts to eliminate these core pillars.” “Medical schools are in the best position to identify how to prepare their students to meet the needs of the physician workforce and must have the autonomy and flexibility to do so,” said David J. Skorton, MD, President and CEO of the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC). “When a medical school recognizes the benefits associated with cultivating student belonging—fostering educational benefits associated with all types of diversity, ensuring equal educational opportunities for their students, and providing instruction on evidence-based knowledge they deem to be fundamental—it is within their purview and their responsibility to pursue those efforts.”"
May 1,Steve Womack,R,Ark.-3,Womack Votes to Combat Antisemitism on College Campuses,"For Immediate Release Contact: Taylor Haulsee     WASHINGTON — Today, Speaker Johnson was joined by House Republican leadership and Committee Chairs to announce a new House-wide effort to crack down on antisemitism on college campuses and hold universities accountable for failing to protect Jewish students.   As part of the effort, the House will be looking into federal funding universities receive, the foreign student visa program that has allowed students sympathetic to terrorist groups to attend our schools, and the generous tax benefits universities enjoy.   The effort will be led by the Education and Workforce Committee, the Ways and Means Committee, the Energy and Commerce Committee, the Judiciary Committee, the Oversight Committee, and the Science, Space and Technology Committee.   Click here to watch the press conference   “Antisemitism is a virus and because the administration and woke university presidents aren’t stepping in, we’re seeing it spread,” said Speaker Johnson. “We must act, and House Republicans will speak to this fateful moment with moral clarity… and that’s why today we’re here to announce a House-wide effort to crack down on antisemitism on college campuses. Nearly every committee here has a role to play in these efforts to stop the madness that has ensued. The federal government plays a critical role in higher education, and we will use all the tools available to us to address this scourge.”   Education and Workforce Committee Chairwoman Virginia Foxx: “No stone must go unturned while buildings are being defaced. Campus greens are being captured, or graduations are being ruined. College is not a park for play acting juveniles or a battleground for radical activist. Everyone affiliated with these universities will receive a healthy dose of reality. Actions have consequences.”   Science, Space and Technology Committee Chairman Frank Lucas: “Universities that can’t protect their students are not in compliance with their funding obligations through the National Science Foundation …As a part of the conditions of receiving taxpayer dollars through the NSF, universities must comply with Title Six of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin…It’s time we review whether universities that allow the harassment, assault or intimidation, other Jewish students are in compliance with their federal obligations.”   Energy and Commerce Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers: “The Energy and Commerce Committee oversees agencies that dole out massive amounts of taxpayer funded research grants… We will be increasing our oversight of institutions that have received public funding and cracking down on those who are in violation of the Civil Rights Act.”   Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan: “On September 30, 2021, Secretary Mayorkas issued his guidelines for immigration enforcement. He said that national security threats are a reason to remove people from this country. The overriding question is simple: Are individuals advocating for the destruction of our dearest and closest ally, the State of Israel, engaged in this anti-Semitic behavior? And is that a national security threat? We think it is and we think the American people deserve answers.”   Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith: “At the Ways and Means Committee, we have been investigating the issue for months in a hearing last November, we examined the nexus between antisemitism tax exempt universities and terror financing networks…We’ve sent letters to university leaders demanding information on what disciplinary action, if any, that they have taken against those whose antisemitic activity violates campus policy. We’ve called on them to disclose any donations or funding they have received from foreign governments as well. Our investigation has already produced more than 1,500 pages of documents that we are now actively reviewing.”   Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer: “These radical protests threatening violence against Jews are anything but organic. It appears global elites are funding these hateful protests and pop-up tent cities. These are the same groups that fund other radical agendas, including diminishing America’s energy production and pushing soft on crime policies that harm the American people. The House Oversight Committee will follow the money trail, expose it to the American people and seek to hold bad actors funding hate accountable.”   ###

My thoughts and prayers are with those who have been affected by or are grieving as a result of these severe tornadoes. I would also like to thank our first responders who have been on the ground responding so nobly over the past couple of days.  As the Representative for Oklahomans in the fourth district, I know that my place this week is in Oklahoma, not Washington, D.C. – and I am currently on my way back home to assess the damage and ensure my constituents get the necessary assistance they need. However, in the meantime, I want to provide those affected with some immediate resources:  Reporting Damage  It is necessary for the state of Oklahoma to complete damage assessments before the Governor submits his request for disaster declaration to the President. It is very important that Oklahomans submit their damage reports, in order for the state to know where to send teams to evaluate the damage, and, in turn, make the appropriate request to the Executive.  To report damage, click here.  Public Shelters   The American Red Cross has opened a storm shelter in Sulphur, Oklahoma. It is located at Crossway Church. The address is 2108 W. Broadway Avenue. Additionally, the Murray County Sherrif’s Office designated the Crossway Church as a reunification center for those who are searching for their missing loved ones.  The Red Cross also opened another shelter in Ardmore at the Christ Community Church, which is located at 2620 Mount Washington Road.  Price Gouging Law  The Emergency Price Stabilization Act is currently in place in the twelve counties that were hit by the storms. This law prohibits unfair price hikes for necessary goods and services during this time of need.    If you experience contractor fraud or more than a ten percent increase for the price of goods and services, call the Oklahoma Attorney General’s Consumer Protection Unit at 833-681-1895.  Power Outages  According to Oklahoma Gas and Electric, over 13,000 customers lost power this weekend. In a statement, the company said it will be a “multi-day restoration event.”  To report and monitor outages:  Insurance Claims  The Oklahoma Insurance Department (OID) is available and ready to help Oklahomans with any difficulties they are experiencing with their insurance claims. Visit OID’s website here or call them at 800-522-0071.  Mass Care  Oklahoma Southern Baptist Relief has two chainsaw teams in Morris and a mass feeding kitchen on the way to Sulphur to provide meals.  Critical Incident Stress Management-trained chaplains are also available for those affected, as well as first responders.  The Salvation Army is giving out meals to first responders, as well as determining the need for clean-up kits and other critical supplies.  Non-Emergency Information  For Oklahomans that need non-emergency or health and human service information, dial 2-1-1 from your phone. 2-1-1 services are available 24 hours a day. E-mail Me"
May 1,Pramila Jayapal,D,Wash.-7,"Jayapal, Dean Call on Administration to Help Prevent Assault on Rafah","April 30, 2024 “The truth is that America needs DEI to disrupt systems of oppression that are active in every facet of our society.” “DEI initiatives are how we combat white supremacy, antisemitism, ableism, sexism, transphobia, and more.” Video (YouTube) WASHINGTON – Today, in a House Oversight Committee hearing, Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) slammed Republicans’ coordinated assault on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, and underscored the importance of DEI initiatives to combatting white supremacy, antisemitism, ableism, sexism, transphobia, and other forms of discrimination. Rep. Pressley also touted a pair of bills she introduced this month with Oversight Committee Ranking Member Jamie Raskin, which would codify equity across federal agencies and improve government services for underserved communities. A transcript of the Congresswoman’s question line is available below and the full video is available here. Transcript: Pressley Slams GOP Assault on DEI, Touts Bill to Codify Equity Across Federal AgenciesHouse Committee on Oversight and AccountabilityApril 30, 2024 REP. PRESSLEY: Thank you, Mr. Miller, for joining us today. I want to take a moment to discuss the critical importance of DEI work.  My colleagues across the aisle have waged an all-out war on diversity, equity, and inclusion. I am not sure if it’s that they just hate one aspect of it, like diversity, or if it’s the combination of all three.  Regardless, this Republican majority has demonstrated it’s out of touch with the priorities of everyday people and has focused its effort on passing legislation and budgets to undermine DEI and entrench systemic discrimination against people of color, folks with disabilities, and other marginalized groups. Republicans sought to defund the Office of Civil Rights in the Department of Education, which is essential to confronting the rise in antisemitism and islamophobia impacting our students.  Republicans voted to stop the hiring of DEI personnel in the military, despite evidence that it will improve military readiness. And Republicans consistently use harmful rhetoric, at every opportunity, to undermine the talent, knowledge, skills, and the training of professionals in every sector where DEI initiatives exist. And they often pervert, mischaracterize, and weaponize the words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., despite the fact that his children, his surviving children, have repeatedly asked them to cease and desist from doing so. It is no surprise that the same people complaining about DEI are the same people who complained about the Me Too movement, about Black Lives Matter, about the ERA, about the gay rights movement, and so much more.  The fact that as soon as someone who is Black or gay or has a disability earns a promotion, Republicans complain that they are unqualified and begin ranting about how diversity, equity, and inclusion is ruining the country. It’s shameful. It’s untrue. It’s discriminatory. And we must not back down in our efforts to create a nation that respects all people.   Might I add that the opposition is majority, overwhelmingly white and male. Now, President Biden signed a historic executive order on his first day in office to take a whole-of-government approach that embodies equity in the Administration’s work to ensure all people benefit, not just the wealthy and well-connected.  Mr. Miller, the Office of Management and Budget plays an outsized role in implementing and overseeing the executive orders on equity. Can you explain why equity is an important part of performance goals, performance goals, for agencies? MR. MILLER: Thank you Congresswoman, and there is a phrase that you used that is central to explaining it. It’s that government should work for all Americans.  So one example of something that we are doing is around accessibility associated with government services. We have many government digital websites and services where it’s hard for some people, including disabled individuals, to access those government services and we’re working to improve that.  Our services aren’t working if they’re not serving all of America. REP. PRESSLEY: Very good. I agree. What is an example of how President Biden’s executive order on equity has helped folks across the country? MR. MILLER: Well, one of the things that we have done is to broaden, and discussed in this hearing, the way in which we are utilizing federal financial assistance to reach more broadly into communities, to improve performance of the dollars to make sure that community-based organizations that might otherwise not have applied for federal funds are able to access those funds and better deliver because they are better — they are closer to those in their community. That means better results, that means more efficiency, and frankly, that means less waste on useless overhead. REP. PRESSLEY: Thank you. The Executive Order, this is truly a first-of-its-kind. I am proud to partner with Ranking Member Raskin on legislation to codify key aspects into law so that they will exist in perpetuity.  The truth is that America needs DEI to disrupt systems of oppression that are active in every facet of our society. DEI initiatives are how we combat white supremacy, antisemitism, ableism, sexism, transphobia, and more. In the face of the opposition, I applaud those who are committed to doing this work, from college presidents, corporate executives, to community organizers and academic researchers. And to those who are against DEI, I would love to know, really, what you are so afraid of. What are you so threatened by?  Thank you and I yield back. ### Washington DC Office 402 Cannon HOB

April 24,Donald W. Norcross,D,N.J.-1,Rep. Norcross Statement on the Planned Pro-Palestinian Walkout at Eastern Regional High School,"U.S. Congressman Washington, D.C. - Congressman Michael C. Burgess, M.D. (R-TX), Chairman of the Budget Committee Health Care Task Force, Representatives Greg Murphy, M.D. (R-NC), Derrick Van Orden (R-WI), and Troy Nehls (R-TX) reintroduced legislation to permanently extend telehealth services for Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and Rural Health Clinics (RHCs). Current Medicare telehealth flexibilities for FQHCs and RHCs, previously extended by Congress under the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023, will expire on December 31, 2024. Click HERE for bill text. “Access to telehealth services is a critical need for Americans, especially in rural and underserved areas of Texas,” said Congressman Michael Burgess. “Expanding telehealth in our community will allow patients to receive quality care in an efficient manner, no matter their location. With technological innovations improving by the day, telehealth is the next step in ensuring the wellbeing of all American patients are prioritized in our health care system. I am looking forward to working with Representatives Murphy, Nehls, and Van Orden in getting this legislation across the House of Representatives floor.” “After practicing medicine in rural eastern North Carolina for the last 25 years, I know that many patients have to travel hours to access healthcare,"" said Congressman Greg Murphy, M.D. ""They face significant burdens in cost as well as time away from work. Telehealth services are critical for these rural communities who live far from clinics and hospitals. We saw how beneficial this valuable service was for folks during the pandemic and it should continue to be available for all Americans. I’m proud to spearhead this effort and am committed to advocating for this commonsense policy alongside my colleagues.” “Rural communities, like those in Wisconsin’s Third District, are routinely left on the sidelines when it comes to accessible health care,” said Congressman Derrick Van Orden. “We recently had multiple hospitals in the rural parts of my district shut down with little notice, and now many of my constituents are without nearby medical services. Expanding telehealth access is an important step in bridging the gap between rural and urban communities and helps ensure that folks, no matter where they are, can receive safe, quality care.”

“Telehealth has revolutionized our nation’s healthcare system to meet the American people’s healthcare needs, particularly in rural and medically underserved communities, such as the 22nd Congressional District of Texas,” said Congressman Troy Nehls. “I am proud to join my colleagues to make the extension of telehealth services for Federally Qualified Health Clinics and Rural Health Clinics permanent to continue providing immediate and increased access to essential healthcare services for millions of American patients nationwide.”   ### Get the most up to date news from me on Twitter."

May 1,Kathy Castor,D,Fla.-14,"Reps. Castor, Beatty Fight for Fairness in Medicine with DEI Resolution"," By Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democrat from Illinois and the ranking member of the House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party. APRIL 26, 2024, 1:17 PM Click here to read the PDF version of the article. Xi Jinping, the general party secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), is in a bind. The economy of the People’s Republic of China is facing a once-in-a-generation crisis. The country’s real estate market is in free-fall, its population sank by 2 million people in 2023, and its stock markets have lost roughly $7 trillion since 2021. Numerous countries are cooperating multilaterally to take countermeasures against what they view as the CCP’s military and economic aggression. Xi’s grip on his rule is secure for the moment, but he is confronting unprecedented challenges to his leadership. Fundamentally, Xi faces a dilemma over China’s future. He and his government must decide whether to continue to prioritize increasing security and centralizing his control over the country, chilling the animal spirits of entrepreneurship in the process, or to loosen his control over the country and reduce aggression toward his neighbors, allowing for greater growth and prosperity. It is highly unlikely that he will choose the latter—and we in the United States must now begin to ready ourselves for potential challenges. Although the latest official economic statistics show China hitting its growth targets, those figures often reflect CCP narratives more than reality, and other indicators show that China’s economic state is precarious at best. Some outside analysts put China’s actual GDP growth as low as 1.5 percent in 2023. The country has lost at least $4.7 trillion in housing wealth since its market peaked in 2021. Other market indicators offer no hope for a rapid recovery, as the housing sector has just reported its worst performance ever recorded for both new and existing housing sales, while new construction has declined by a record 60 percent compared to pre-pandemic levels. After defaulting on more than $100 billion in international bonds over the past 4 years, China’s largest developers have either collapsed or survive only through government support. Injections of foreign capital have not helped to close the gap. Foreign direct investment into China is at its lowest point in three decades. China’s stock markets are down by nearly 20 percent over the past year. While stocks are relatively unimportant to Chinese household savings, public wealth is overwhelmingly tied up in real estate. Major players—such as Evergrande, Vanke, and Country Garden—are teetering on the brink of collapse as property prices continue to fall despite the government’s best efforts to prop them up. The situation could grow far worse as the country approaches a potential deflationary crisis following the largest drop in consumer prices in 15 years. All this comes as the country faces the beginning of its demographic free-fall, during which an aging Chinese population may decline by as much as 100 million people by 2050. Since the beginning of former leader Deng Xiaoping’s reform and opening, the CCP has sold China’s economic growth as a key pillar of its legitimacy. Many in the party still recognize the importance of solving these economic challenges to its legitimacy and control. One important way out is foreign direct investment. Some in the CCP are eager to court U.S. capital and reassure U.S. investors that China remains a hospitable market for doing business. At the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit last November, Xi dined with U.S. business leaders and emphasized that “China is ready to be a partner and friend of the United States, and there is plenty of room for bilateral cooperation.” However, despite Xi’s rhetoric, the actions of the Chinese government do not line up with creating a hospitable business environment for U.S. and other foreign companies. China has been steadily tightening its national security and data protection laws at the expense of businesses being able to conduct due diligence, market research, or otherwise normal operations. Earlier this year, the Chinese government broadened the scope of its state secrets law, making it even more difficult for businesses to provide information for foreign investors and stakeholders. Even more chilling is the detainment of business leaders; in 2023, many top Chinese executives from technology, finance, and real estate companies were detained or went missing. This threat is not limited to Chinese executives, as foreigners have faced exit bans. The Chinese military’s increasingly aggressive actions in Taiwan also rattle U.S.-based and other foreign businesses. The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has steadily increased incursions into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone, and in September 2023, there was a record number of PLA aircraft around Taiwanese airspace in one day. In the event of an invasion of Taiwan, the United States and other Group of Seven countries would likely impose severe economic sanctions, and estimates of the damage to the global economy are in the trillions of dollars. Companies do not want to become caught in the crossfire. Yet Xi seems willing to contemplate taking these risks for his ambition of controlling Taiwan. Xi now faces a fundamental dilemma in balancing his country’s prosperity and his party’s level of control. Despite the importance of maintaining economic growth for his popular support, Xi has consistently prioritized control ahead of his people’s prosperity. As Xi wrestles with this choice, we and others—including the Chinese people—must hope for the best while continuing to prepare for the worst."

Thanks to a bipartisan coalition of Democrats and Republicans, led by President Biden, we were finally able to meet the national security needs of the American people. From the very beginning of this Congress, House Democrats have put people over politics and found bipartisan common ground with traditional Republicans in order to deliver real results. At the same time, House Democrats have aggressively pushed back against MAGA extremism.

April 30,Hakeem Jeffries,D,N.Y.-8,JOINT DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP STATEMENT ON MOTION TO VACATE,"For Immediate Release Contact: Taylor Haulsee     NEW YORK CITY — At a press conference on the steps of the Low Memorial Library at Columbia University, Speaker Johnson denounced the inexcusable treatment of Jewish students on Columbia’s campus and called for University President Minouche Shafik to resign if she can’t bring an immediate end to the chaos.   Click here to watch the press conference   “Sadly, Columbia’s administrators have chosen to let the threats, the fear, and the intimidation of the mob rule to overtake American principles like free speech and the free exchange of ideas and the free exercise of religion,” Speaker Johnson said. “They have co-opted First Amendment arguments to protect genocide and to elevate the voices of antisemitism. They have proven themselves to be incapable of achieving their basic responsibility, which is keeping students safe. We just can’t allow this kind of hatred and any antisemitism to flourish on our campuses, and it must be stopped in its tracks.”   Prior to the press conference, Speaker Johnson met with Jewish students from Columbia alongside Rabbi Yuda Drizin. “We just left a meeting with Jewish students who told us of the heinous acts of bigotry that they have experienced simply because of their faith,” Speaker Johnson said. “Their bravery is inspiring, much more inspiring than some of the activities we’re seeing here. They should never have to confront such hate on an American college campus at such a revered institution.”   Speaker Johnson was joined at the press conference by Education and Workforce Committee Chairwoman Virginia Foxx, Rep. Anthony D’Esposito,  Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, and Rep. Mike Lawler.   Rep. Foxx: “So, I have a message, President Shafik, and a message for you all too. The inmates are running the asylum. Take back control of this once great institution. You took action last week, it’s time to act again. If not, the committee will pursue every possible avenue to create a safe learning environment for Jewish students. “   Rep. D’Esposito: “If you are a protester on this campus, and you are proud that you’ve been endorsed by Hamas, you are part of the problem. When you cheer on the fact that you enjoy Hamas and Hezbollah, you are yourself part of the problem. Mr. Speaker, I’m proud to join with you here today in calling for the immediate resignation of the President of Columbia. She has failed her duty. She is not keeping students safe.”   Rep. Malliotakis: “It is truly outrageous, and it’s clear that the president of this university cannot control the campus, she cannot and will not hold students who are doing these types of antisemitic activities accountable, and that she cannot keep the students who are of Jewish faith – who, who have paid a lot of money and have worked very hard to get to an Ivy League institution like this – that she cannot keep them safe. And that is why I joined my colleagues in calling for her resignation.”   Rep. Lawler: “I want Palestinians to be free too, from their oppressor, Hamas. And every single one of you students that support Hamas are an absolute abomination. …If you want a ceasefire, the fastest way for a ceasefire to occur is for Hamas to surrender and to release the hostages. And if you can’t call for that, you are a pathetic embarrassment to this institution and to students everywhere. It is time for President Shafik to resign in disgrace.”   Read Speaker Johnson’s full remarks below:   “We’re here today at one of America’s preeminent academic institutions on a very important day in a very important time. Throughout history, Columbia students have contributed to the great storybook of America’s life and thought. Visionary American leaders like Alexander Hamilton and John Jay and the Jewish leader Gershom Seixas knew the self-evident truth that was at the heart of this country, and once, at the heart of this university. And that is that we are endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights. They should not be infringed.   “The founders and the great leaders who had come through this institution in the past believed in religious liberty. They believed in democracy. They believed in morality and virtue and the dignity of every human person. They believed in the free exchange of ideas, and they detested mob rule.   “We are standing here right now in the steps of the Low Library. In this very building right behind us, Columbia University once awarded Winston Churchill in an honorary degree, and it was Churchill who said, “It is manifestly right that Jews should have a national home where they may be reunited.” We believe in that principle, and today I’m here to proclaim to all those who gnash their teeth and demand to wipe the state of Israel off the map and attack our innocent Jewish students, this simple truth: neither Israel, nor these Jewish students on this campus, will ever stand alone.   “Today, Hamas issued an endorsement statement of the protestors on this campus. They called them the future leaders of America. It is detestable. All of this has to be said because the cherished traditions of this university are being overtaken right now by radical and extreme ideologies. They place a target on the backs of Jewish students in the United States, and here on this campus, a growing number of students have chanted in support of terrorists. They have chased down Jewish students. They have mocked them and reviled them. They have shouted racial epithets. They have screamed at those who bear the star of David.   “They have told Jewish students who wear the star of David to leave the country and shamefully some professors and faculty have joined the mobs. Things have gotten so out of control that the school has canceled in-person classes, and now they’ve come up with this hybrid model where they will discriminate against Jewish students. They’re not allowed to come to class anymore for fear of their lives. And it’s detestable.   “As Columbia has allowed these lawless agitators and radicals to take over, the virus of antisemitism is spread across other campuses. By some counts, as many as 200 universities have a similar form of protest. Right now at Yale, a Jewish student was stabbed in the eye with a Palestinian flag and 45 students were arrested. At NYU, Pro-Hamas protestors were shouting from the ‘river to the sea.’ Anti-Israel encampments are popping up at universities all across this country.   “The madness has to stop. We just left a meeting with Jewish students who told us of the heinous acts of bigotry that they have experienced simply because of their faith. Their bravery is inspiring, much more inspiring than some of the activities we’re seeing here. They should never have to confront such hate on an American college campus at such a revered institution.   “Antisemitism has been growing in America and it’s clear why. Powerful people have refused to condemn it, and some have even peddled it themselves. From university professors to public officials, people in positions of authority have denied the horrific facts of September 11th, 2001, the attacks on the United States. That happened right here in New York City, and they’ve attempted to excuse or to ignore the barbaric attack of Hamas in Israel on October 7th, 2023. Where Israeli women and children were savagely raped and murdered, and infants were cooked in ovens.   “Crowds of radical left activists have chanted death to America, and on our own streets in this country, and some public officials have refused to condemn them. Others have openly defended these acts on campus and the harassing and the intimidation and the threatening of innocent Jewish students simply because of who they are. They’ve called that peaceful protest, and some have even gone as far as calling for the state of Israel to be eliminated. These are words we expect from Ayatollahs in Iran, not American lawmakers, and not American students. And unsurprisingly, it has given way to threats and violence in a generation of students don’t feel safe in their own classrooms or where they live or where they worship. Let me say this very simply, no American of any color or creed should ever have to live under those kinds of threats. That is not who we are in this country.   “Sadly, Columbia’s administrators have chosen to let the threats, the fear, and the intimidation of the mob rule to overtake American principles like free speech and the free exchange of ideas and the free exercise of religion. They have co-opted First Amendment arguments to protect genocide and to elevate the voices of antisemitism. They have proven themselves to be incapable of achieving their basic responsibility, which is keeping students safe. We just can’t allow this kind of hatred and any antisemitism to flourish on our campuses, and it must be stopped in its tracks. Those who are perpetrating this violence should be arrested.   “And I’m here today joining my colleagues in calling on President Shafik to resign if she cannot immediately bring order to this chaos. As Speaker of the House, I’m committing today that the Congress will not be silent. As Jewish students are expected to run for their lives and stay home from their classes hiding in fear. In the House of Representatives, we’ve already acted to address antisemitism on campuses. We have passed a number of statutes to address this matter, and we call upon the US Senate to act upon our legislation.”   ###

April 26,Andy Biggs,R,Ariz.-5,Surveying Bidens Border Crisis in Lukeville and the Tohono Oodham Reservation,"April 29, 2024 For Immediate Release Contact: Taylor Haulsee   WASHINGTON — On Monday, Speaker Johnson released a statement following reports that the International Criminal Court, which has no jurisdiction over Israel, may issue arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli officials.   “It is disgraceful that the International Criminal Court (ICC) is reportedly planning to issue baseless and illegitimate arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and other senior Israeli officials.   “Such a lawless action by the ICC would directly undermine U.S. national security interests. If unchallenged by the Biden administration, the ICC could create and assume unprecedented power to issue arrest warrants against American political leaders, American diplomats, and American military personnel, thereby endangering our country’s sovereign authority.   “Instead of wrongly targeting Israel, the ICC should pursue charges against Iran and its terror proxies, including Hamas, for engaging in horrific war crimes.   “The Biden Administration must immediately and unequivocally demand that the ICC stand down and the U.S. should use every available tool to prevent such an abomination.”   ###

Chris Smith (R-NJ), the Dean of the New Jersey Congressional Delegation, delivered the following remarks today on the House Floor while leading the House of Representatives in a moment of silence to honor the late Rep. Donald Payne Jr. (D-NJ):


             “Mr. Speaker, my colleagues and I rise to convey our deepest sorrow on the passing of our good friend, six-term New Jersey Congressman Donald Payne Jr. of the 10th District.             We are grateful for his public service and offer our prayers and condolences to his wife Bea and their children, Donald III, Jack, and Yvonne.             Like his father before him—Congressman Donald Payne Sr.—Donald was a dedicated public servant who tirelessly and tenaciously worked to improve the lives of New Jersey families, especially the poor.             He was a kind and compassionate lawmaker who cared deeply for the people of his district, our state, the country—and those in need, especially the sick.             As a diabetic, he fought to lower the cost of insulin. He wrote the House-passed Removing Barriers to Colorectal Cancer Screening Act and the Amputation Reduction and Compassion (ARC) Act which would provide full coverage for screening tests for Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) to help reduce amputations.             His TEST for Lead Act was designed to protect children from lead-contaminated drinking water in schools and he wrote the Homeland Security Interoperable Act that became law in July of 2015.             As Chairman and then-Ranking Member of the House Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials Subcommittee, Donald helped lead the charge to improve America’s transportation infrastructure, played a key role in securing the Gateway project and was a powerful ally of Amtrak.             Donald Payne served two terms on the Newark City Council including as President and beginning in 2005, three terms as an Essex County Freeholder—now called County Commissioner.             Donald Payne Jr. will be deeply missed.” ### Chris has three offices dedicated to constituent services.

April 29,Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan,D,Northern Marianas Islands,NMHC visits,"The crisis along our southern border rages on because President Biden and Congressional Democrats are not taking it seriously. Throughout this Congress, I have continually fought to end President Biden’s open border policies. On May 11, 2023, I joined my House colleagues in voting to pass H.R. 2, the Secure the Border Act. This bill is the strongest border security measure to pass either chamber of Congress in modern history. This bill has been sitting on Chuck Schumer’s desk for nearly a year. On Saturday, the House had the opportunity to pass meaningful border security and sadly Democrats again rejected this measure. H.R. 3602, the End the Border Catastrophe Act, would resume border wall construction, increase the number of Border Patrol agents, reinstate the Remain in Mexico policy, and end catch-and-release policies, all very similar to provisions in H.R. 2. Additionally, this measure added language to reimburse states for costs they have incurred attempting to secure the border because the Biden Administration failed to do so. Unfortunately, while House Republicans supported this commonsense measure, the bill failed to get the two-thirds vote required to pass as a suspension. All but five Democrats voted against this effort to secure the border. Since President Biden took office, there have been 9.2 million encounters of individuals attempting to illegally enter our country with over 7.6 million of those encounters happening along our southern border. On top of that astronomical number, there have been over 1.8 million known gotaways, meaning individuals who illegally entered the U.S. and were not stopped by border patrol. Last month alone, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) recorded 189,372 encounters at the southwest border. This includes an individual from Lebanon who admitted to being a Hezbollah terrorist and having intentions of making a bomb. President Biden refuses to address this crisis, and Senate Democrats refuse to help House Republicans legislatively force his hand. Border security is a matter of national security, and we must act immediately.

April 29,Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan,D,Northern Marianas Islands,"Congratulations, Gwanpil Son","Every April, we celebrate Second Chance Month, an opportunity to remember those in our community who are reentering society after involvement in the criminal justice system and consider the unique obstacles they face. America is the land of opportunity and second chances. Previously incarcerated individuals who take accountability for their actions and improve their lives should be able to count on our support. Approximately 600,000 people are released from state and federal prisons each year. Upon release, many of these folks do not have basic resources like a savings account, a driver’s license, a primary care provider, or a job. The latest large scale and long-term recidivism study conducted by the Department of Justice’s Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) reported that “66 percent of prisoners were arrested within three years and, 82 percent were arrested within ten years.” Another BJS study tracked employment for over 51,000 individuals released from federal prisons in 2010. One-third of those individuals were not employed at all during that four-year period. I firmly believe that one of the most impactful things we can do to help these individuals break the cycle of crime and violence is to help connect them to a good job. I have seen firsthand how a chance at employment can help turn a life around. Prior to serving in Congress, I owned and operated a construction firm, which participated in work release programs and was successful in helping those individuals find full-time employment. Holding down a job is a key aspect of reconnecting justice-involved individuals with their larger communities. It gives individuals a sense of purpose, reaffirms their self-worth, and brings stability to their families. We have a strong federal tool, the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), that we can use to improve federal efforts to assist these individuals in finding a job. WIOA provides the framework for the nation’s workforce development programs and focuses on helping eligible workers connect with the training they need to reskill and upskill to meet the needs of our economy. WIOA is overdue for reauthorization, and the U.S. House of Representatives recently passed legislation that would inject new funds into the program and implement measures to ensure training leads to family-sustaining jobs for workers. This reauthorization package included my bill, the Workforce Reentry Act, legislation which would prompt innovation and improvement in the reentry of justice-involved individuals into the workforce through competitive grants, rigorous evaluation, and the dissemination of best practices. Since 2005, the Department of Labor has been operating the loosely structured Reentry Employment Opportunities program, awarding funding to organizations providing mentoring, job training, and case management services. However, independent evaluations have found this haphazard approach has produced minimal impacts on recidivism and labor market outcomes. My bill would codify the Reentry Employment Opportunities program and implement several reforms to ensure that we are pursuing evidence-based approaches that will connect eligible individuals with employers in their communities in in-demand industries. Moreover, grantees will be held to rigorous performance outcomes on participants’ employment, earnings, and credential attainment. This will give participants the assurance that the WIOA training they receive, prior to and after their release from prison, will lead them to stable employment that can sustain them in the days, weeks, months, and years after their reentry. The U.S. House of Representatives’ WIOA reauthorization package, A Stronger Workforce for America Act, is transformational legislation that is strengthened by the provision to codify and renew the Reentry Employment Opportunities program. I call on the U.S. Senate to take up this legislation without delay so that thousands of reentering citizens can have access to lifechanging workforce development programs. While the observation of Second Chance Month will soon come to a close, let’s commit ourselves all year to make good on our promise to Americans with experience in the justice system and offer them the best tool we can for success: a stable job. These opportunities will lead to sustainable career paths and give these individuals and their families a true second chance. Rep.

April 29,Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan,D,Northern Marianas Islands,Preserving language and culture," April 29, 2024 The Honorable Mike JohnsonSpeaker, U.S. House of RepresentativesH-232, The Capitol I write with respect to the need to urgently consider comprehensive legislation designed to address the dangerous rise in antisemitism across America. In May of 2023, President Joe Biden released the first-ever U.S. National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism, which outlines important executive action taken by the administration and makes legislative recommendations at every level of government. Quite disturbingly, subsequent to the release of the Biden administration’s strategic blueprint and in the aftermath of the heinous October 7 attack by Hamas, antisemitic incidents have risen to historic levels. Other than taking up resolutions that are symbolically meaningful, the House has failed to consider comprehensive legislation to combat antisemitism. We have a moral obligation to do much more. To that end, the Co-Chairs of the House and Senate Bipartisan Task Forces for Combating Antisemitism, including Representatives Kathy Manning and Chris Smith, introduced bipartisan legislation in early April that addresses the crisis of antisemitism and aggressively confronts the startling threats against Jewish people in America. The Countering Antisemitism Act would strengthen efforts to combat antisemitism in the U.S. and implement policies designed to keep Jewish communities safe. It supports implementation of the National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism and helps make its policies permanent. H.R. 7921 establishes a National Coordinator in the White House to oversee a new Interagency Task Force to Counter Antisemitism focused on combating domestic antisemitism and ensuring coordination among the federal agencies in fighting this terrible hatred. The legislation also requires the FEMA Administrator to guarantee the agency has the resources needed to operate the Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NGSP) which provides funding to synagogues, Jewish schools and other institutions for physical security enhancements. In the national security supplemental that Congress passed and the President signed into law last week, we included $400 million for the NGSP, underscoring this urgent need. In addition, this bill ensures the administration reports to Congress on implementation of federal strategies to combat antisemitism and designates a senior official to advise and oversee the Department of Education’s efforts to fight antisemitism on college campuses. There is nothing scheduled on the floor this week that would accomplish the concrete, thoughtful strategies outlined by the Biden administration, set forth in the legislation and echoed by leading Jewish organizations across the country. The effort to crush antisemitism and hatred in any form is not a Democratic or Republican issue. It’s an American issue that must be addressed in a bipartisan manner with the fierce urgency of now. In this spirit, I strongly urge you to schedule a vote on the bipartisan Countering Antisemitism Act forthwith.

April 29,Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan,D,Northern Marianas Islands,Keeping up with Guam Vet Center,"April 25, 2024 One-Third of Federal and State Prisons Located Within Three Miles of Toxic Superfund Site  Text of Resolution (PDF) BOSTON – Following their March 29 visit to Massachusetts Correctional Institution-Norfolk, Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) and Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Clean Air, Climate, and Nuclear Safety introduced the Declaration of Environmental Rights for Incarcerated People. This resolution affirms the human right of nearly two million people currently incarcerated in the United States to a healthy and safe environment and to advocate for protecting and improving their environmental health. The resolution specifically recognizes decarceration as the principal strategy to address environmental health harms of criminal legal systems.  “Everyone has a right to clean air, water and living environment, including people who are currently incarcerated,” said Rep. Pressley. “As we work to dismantle the racist and harmful system of mass incarceration, we must confront the environmental injustices that define carceral settings and affirm the human dignity of folks behind the wall. Proud to introduce this resolution in partnership with Senator Markey, advocates, and those closest to the pain.” “Our criminal legal system’s decision to put millions of people behind bars has torn apart families, destabilized communities, and allowed others to profit from mistreating other human beings,” said Senator Markey. “As we continue to fight for decarceration, we must also give currently incarcerated people the right to a healthy and safe environment. I look forward to continuing to lift up the voices of incarcerated individuals and ensure they have opportunities to work with lawmakers to translate their lived experiences into truly effective solutions.” “For persons with lived experience, this resolution marks the beginning of connecting the intersections between carceral states of being and humanizing incarcerated populations,” said Michael L. Mauney II, African American Coalition Committee Community Outreach Director and DeeperThanWater Coalition organizer. “The passing of this resolution would symbolize an effort to eradicate the exception clause mentioned in the Thirteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Incarcerated populations support efforts to humanize us and to decarcerate and end mass incarceration.” The lawmakers’ resolution would ensure such rights as:   The resolution text was developed in partnership with the African American Coalition Committee and other incarcerated leaders at MCI-Norfolk. During Congresswoman Pressley’s and Senator Markey’s March 29 visit to the facility, incarcerated individuals shared testimonials of living through a water quality crisis that has gripped the facility since 2011.   Prisons and other carceral facilities greatly increase the exposure of incarcerated people, staff, and surrounding communities to toxic and dangerous conditions. These and other threats disproportionately harm vulnerable populations, including Black Americans, Indigenous people, Latine, and LGBTQ+ individuals, who are more likely to be incarcerated. The health impacts of incarceration are so severe that every year behind bars takes an average of two years off an individual’s life expectancy. The Declaration of Environmental Rights for Incarcerated Individuals is endorsed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the Prison Policy Initiative, Citizens United for Rehabilitation of Errants (CURE), and DeeperThanWater.  “Environmental health and safety are critically important, both for incarcerated people and for those who work, volunteer, and visit in our nation’s prisons,” said David Fathi, Director of the American Civil Liberties Union National Prison Project.  “The Resolution is an important step toward ensuring environmental justice for all.”  “We at Prison Policy Initiative strongly support a Declaration of Environmental Rights for Incarcerated People. This Declaration speaks to both the devastatingly real negative impacts of a hostile prison environment on an individual’s physical and mental health and the inalienable human right of people in prison to access clean water and air. We are proud to support this recognition of incarcerated people’s right to be free of a toxic environment,” said Sarah Staudt, Policy & Advocacy Director at the Prison Policy Initiative.  “This resolution is a step in the right direction.  It will give criminal justice agencies, especially prisons, the obligation to rehabilitate,” said Charles Sullivan, Director of CURE.  “We know that environmental injustice is one of the many things that make carceral settings toxic. Through that lens, this resolution makes clear that decarceration is the strongest and most important strategy we have to protect the rights of incarcerated people and to ensure that our communities are safe and healthy,” said Christine Mitchell, Sc.D., DeeperThanWater Coalition organizer.

April 29,Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan,D,Northern Marianas Islands,Visiting students at Marianas HS,"U.S. Congressman Washington, D.C. - Congressman Michael C. Burgess, M.D. (R-TX), Chairman of the Budget Committee Health Care Task Force, joined House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington (R-TX) in sending a letter to Comptroller General Gene Dodaro of the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) requesting an investigation into the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) and its effect on the federal budget.

Click HERE for the full letter.

On the costly effect of CMMI on the federal budget:

Increases in federal spending on health care in the United States—including Medicare and Medicaid—continue to exert significant pressure on the federal budget. At the same time, studies have found that higher levels of spending do not reliably lead to enhanced quality of care.

In 2010, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated CMMI would result in net savings of $1.3 billion over the ten-year budget window. A September 2023 report from CBO revised the agency’s prior analysis, estimating CMMI’s activities increased direct spending by $5.4 billion in Medicare, between 2011 and 2020.

In addition, CBO now currently projects that CMMI’s activities will increase net federal spending by $1.3 billion in Medicare, over the center’s second decade, which extends from 2021 to 2030.

On requesting GAO examine CMMI’s use of dedicated funding and assessment of its performance:
   Background:
Established by Obamacare with the goal of saving taxpayer money and improving the quality of care for beneficiaries, CMMI has failed to deliver on its mandate. 

In 2010, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected that CMMI would produce net savings over the 10-year budget window. CBO revised its analysis last year, finding that CMMI is not saving tax dollars but rather has increased federal spending by billions of dollars.

The letter follows a recent HCTF member roundtable focused on examining why CMMI is adding billions to the national debt, rather than generating budgetary savings as the program intended.

April 29,Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan,D,Northern Marianas Islands,Dr. Nathrani honored,"Recently I attended “Thunder in the Hills”, a play based off the infamous 1912 Carroll County Courthouse shootout, performed at the Courthouse.   Carroll County and the nation were rocked by the March 14, 1912 shootout. Newspapermen from all across the country flocked to the region to cover events. Until the sinking of the Titanic, this was the nation’s top story.   “The Courthouse Tragedy” emanated from a trial involving Floyd Allen, a descendant of one of the oldest families of Carroll County. Floyd had accosted a Carroll County Deputy officer attempting to turn in two of Floyd’s nephews.   Upon Allen’s conviction, bedlam erupted in the Carroll County Courthouse. Dozens of bullets flew inside the courtroom. The community and the Commonwealth could not believe what had happened.   The shootout claimed five lives, including a Judge, the Commonwealth’s Attorney and Sheriff.    Some members of the so-called “Allen Clan” were taken into custody quickly and tried. Sidna Allen and his nephew would be captured six months later in Iowa. Floyd and his son, Claude, were executed.  Sidna Allen was sentenced to thirty-five years (in 1926, he was pardoned).   To this day, people from all over Virginia and the country remain interested in the incident. Families on both sides are still sensitive about the disputed events. At the memorial service I attended in 2012, some surviving family members of those who died in this tragedy traveled to Hillsville from as far away as New England.     My connection comes from my great-grandmother of Rockbridge County.  She and her Bible study group traveled to Richmond to pray with inmates at Libby prison, including Sidna Allen.   While in prison, Sidna focused on woodworking and building furniture in order to sell items to support his family.   During my great-grandmother’s visit, she purchased a box made by Allen.  Written inside is, ‘Made by J. Sidna Allen, $5.’    My grandmother handed the box down to me a few years before she died.   Since elected to Congress, I have displayed the box in my DC office.   The Carroll County Historical Society Museum features a collection of Sidna Allen’s work: tables, treasure and jewelry boxes. His woodworking style reflected folk marquetry, creating intricate designs in his wooden objects.    As we look back on this incident, it’s important to remember that we learn little about the past by attempting to apply modern law and mores.  Romance, politics, power, and family honor all merged to become a lethal powder keg in this tragic event.   The play was extremely well done. I was mesmerized by the performance. This same group has performed “Thunder in the Hills” every few years since 2012.   They say this is it. But I for one hope they will do it again or that maybe the Barter Theatre will pick up the production in the future.   Amongst the excellent cast was my former colleague in the Virginia House of Delegates, Tom Jackson. He played Floyd Allen and was superb. After the play, he showed me both Floyd Allen’s pocket watch which he carried throughout the performance, and the lawbooks in the old courthouse’s library which belonged to Commonwealth Attorney William Foster, who was killed in the shootout, and Dexter Goad, the Circuit Court Clerk, who was injured.    I should also mention that Martha Goad was played by Cynthia Jackson, Tom’s wife, who was at Emory & Henry College while I was there. There were many outstanding performances and I do not believe I have ever seen a better cast.   As the play shows, the story has always been complicated. At Sidna Allen’s death, the Lynchburg Newspaper wrote, “The Allens have just about proved their theory of their defense.  That they were not all fundamentally bad men, but men for whom fate, in a bad hour, set a vicious stage.”    In a like manner, Carroll County is a good place that more than 100 years ago found itself thrust by fate, in a bad hour, into a vicious set of circumstances.  Let us hope that this may never occur again.   Sidna’s old house in Carroll County remains today. Located just outside Fancy Gap, the Queen Anne style house is an iconic Carroll landmark. In 1974, the house was designated for the National Register of Historic Places.   A portion of the play’s ticket sales go to the J. Sidna Allen House Restoration project. Contributions can be sent to the charitable organization at:   J. Sidna Allen Home  c/o Carroll County Historical Society and Museum  P.O. Box 937 Hillsville, VA 24343.   You may also visit carrollvamuseum.org to make an online donation via PayPal.   If you have questions, concerns, or comments, feel free to contact my office.  You can call my Abingdon office at 276-525-1405 or my Christiansburg office at 540-381-5671.  To reach my office via email, please visit my website at https://morgangriffith.house.gov.    ### Enter your email address to get the latest updates straight to your inbox.

April 29,Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan,D,Northern Marianas Islands,How we prosper from the ocean,"Tax Day, the height of the year for the IRS, and probably an item on your spring-cleaning list, came and went last Monday, April 15th. As we all scrambled to meet the April 15th deadline, it's evident that the aftermath of Tax Day brings a significant workload for hardworking IRS employees and honest taxpayers alike. No matter what side of it you’re on, you still had to file; no one was granted immunity to audits, even potential delays to receiving their returns. All of this to say, I stumbled upon an eye-opening statistic: this year, an estimated 19.4 million taxpayers were expected to request an extension to file their taxes, giving them until June 1st to file. This number is quite a jump from a decade ago when only 12.5 million taxpayers sought extensions. What's behind this rise? It's not merely procrastination due to busy schedules; you guessed it - it's a reflection of the challenges posed by record-high inflation and the soaring cost of living.  If compiling all the individual documents and forms to file wasn’t enough of a stressor, there was a noticeable uptick in reports about tax fraud attempts by resourceful scammers. These individuals were and still are continuously seeking new ways to exploit tax-paying citizens for financial gain, whether it’s through fake bills, falsified late fees or requesting additional funds through forms that don’t exist. Here are some important tips to protect yourself from tax scams: · The IRS will NEVER contact you through email, text, or social media. Be wary of suspicious messages requesting personal information. · Do not store your Social Security Number on a computer or cell phone. Hackers can break in and steal your information without you knowing, so it’s best to delete it from old emails, notes, or documents. · File your tax returns early if you can! The less time criminals have to impersonate you and steal your refund the better. · If you’re filing online, be sure to use a secure network. Do not use public Wi-Fi somewhere like a coffee shop or library.  Last year alone, we assisted nearly 400 constituents with IRS-related issues, and our offices will be available to assist this year as well. If you filed your taxes before the April 15th deadline, but have not received your tax return yet, I encourage you to contact one of our district offices in Cottleville or Jefferson City. Although we cannot officially advocate on your behalf until after the IRS' June 1st deadline, we are available to discuss your situation and provide guidance before then. Please don't hesitate to reach out to us for assistance.  CONTACT US: I encourage you to visit my official website or call my offices in Jefferson City (573-635-7232) or Cottleville (636-327-7055) with your questions and concerns. If you want even greater access to what I am working on, please visit my YouTube site, Facebook page, and keep up-to-date with Twitter and Instagram. ###"
April 24,Kevin McCarthy,R,Calif.-20,Speaker Johnson to Antisemitic Protestors: “Go Back to Class”,"As the only licensed forester in Congress and Chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, I am a passionate advocate for our forests. I often say that forestry is a win-win-win: healthy forests give us pure water, clean air, diverse wildlife habitats, and forest products that we use every day. I know firsthand the countless benefits trees provide to our daily lives, and I understand the importance of science-based policy to ensure our forests continue to thrive. This April, I hope you will join me in celebrating Arbor Day. May we recognize and honor the importance of trees and all the natural blessings they bring us. It also serves as an opportunity for us to acknowledge our role in ensuring forests remain healthy and thriving. Each of us has a role to play in being good stewards of our environment, ensuring our forests are healthier and stronger for generations to enjoy, whether that be through planting trees in your backyard or simply supporting active forest management. I’m working on comprehensive forestry legislation and held a legislative hearing last week on a discussion draft of commonsense policy to empower land managers to use the tools they need to quickly address the mismanagement of our forests before it becomes a catastrophe. I’m also proud to champion legislation like the EXPLORE Act, the Save Our Sequoias Act, the America’s Wildlife Habitat Conservation Act, and more that will make advancements to conserve our environment and ensure our public lands and forests are properly managed for Americans to enjoy for years to come.  Today and every day, let us celebrate our amazing and magnificent forests that God has so graciously blessed us with in America!"
April 29,Kevin McCarthy,R,Calif.-20,"Speaker Johnson Statement on Potential ICC Arrest Warrants for Netanyahu, Israeli Officials","IndyGo buses keep our city moving. That’s why I’ll continue to fight for federal dollars to important public transit projects like the Red Line, Blue Line, and Purple Line. 
 
Today, I was proud to join IndyGo leadership to highlight $1 million in federal Community Project Funding for the Blue Line and reiterate my support for public transit. Each year, Members of Congress submit Community Project Funding requests to the House Appropriations Committee for a select number of qualified projects benefiting their districts. This year, I secured funding for 14 projects across Indianapolis, including the Blue Line.
 
Our community has needed expanded public transit for years but has lacked the funding to make that vision a reality. Now, we’re making sure every Indianapolis resident can access every corner of our city safely and efficiently. Our city belongs to everyone, and IndyGo is expanding opportunity to all Indianapolis residents -- all while providing much-needed safety and infrastructure improvements. 
  
As a senior Member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I’ve consistently advocated for expanded public transit, including through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law – which will direct $1.2 trillion of federal funds towards transportation, energy, and climate infrastructure projects and create good-paying jobs. To date, $4.7 billion has been announced for Indiana project involving roads, bridges, public transit, ports, airport, electric school and transit buses, EV charging, and more. Last year, IndyGo received $19 million from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to purchase 40-foot, diesel-electric, hybrid buses to replace older buses in its fleet. 
 
More details about the $1 million Community Project Funding investment can be found below: 
 Project Name: Indianapolis Public Transportation Corporation Blue Line Infrastructure
 Award Amount: $1,000,000
 Project Description: The funding would be used to improve a high-performing transit route that connects the Indianapolis International Airport, Downtown Indianapolis, and diverse neighborhoods. The project will replace deficient stormwater infrastructure and pavement, and introduce dedicated bus lanes that will improve speed, reliability, and safety. Funds will support stormwater construction of the Pleasant Run and Pogues Run outfalls and includes 2-5’ diameter trunk sewer. The funds will pay for infrastructure to reduce flooding events, which will improve public health and safety. The existing deficient combined sewer system will be replaced with a modern separated sewer system and detention sites.
 Financial Literacy Month: 
 
April is Financial Literacy Month – and I have a bill to advance financial literacy for American families. My bill, the Young Americans Financial Literacy Act, will develop financial literacy programs for young people. Most schools don’t teach you about credit, how to open a bank account, or how to save for a home or a rainy-day fund. Our young people are going out into the world, earning their first paychecks, applying for student aid, and establishing financial independence. We need to prepare young people as best we can.  With financial literacy, we can empower young people with the information they need to succeed. Learn more about my bill here.   Team Carson is Here to Serve:  Did you know that in 2023, my office responded to over 70,000 of your messages and brought $1.5 MILLION directly back to Indianapolis families? Team Carson is here to serve you – get in touch to find out how we can help you navigate a federal agency, access government benefits, or recognize a community member’s milestone.  For updates throughout the week, don’t forget to follow me on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.

April 29,Lloyd Smucker,R,Pa.-11,"Rep. Lloyd Smucker: This Second Chance Month, lets help returning Americans get back to work","502 Cannon HOB, Washington, DC 20515Email Me(202) 225-6435 This week, as I visited a number of Third District communities, several major economic indicators were published, confirming what we already know: President Biden’s inflation hasn’t ended, and a radical change of direction in Washington’s fiscal policy is needed to remedy an ailing economy. This week, the U.S. Department of Commerce reported America’s gross domestic product for the first quarter of 2024 grew by a mere 1.6 percent and core inflation—which leaves out the more dynamic fluctuation of food and energy prices—rose by 3.7 percent. As both these numbers came out much less favorable than projections, it’s not surprising small business optimism has reached its lowest level since 2012, according to the National Federation of Independent Business. To make matters worse, the workforce participation rate remains well below its pre-pandemic level. As discouraged workers have yet to return from the sidelines of the economy, I continue to hear from Third District employers about the difficulty of filling positions for which they are hiring. Hope for the nation’s economic recovery rests on inflation cooling to 2 percent, which would provide the Federal Reserve with the chance to cut interest rates currently on a 23-year-high. Ominously, Fed Chair Jerome Powell recently said it is taking “longer than expected” to reach this target. However, the path to making life more affordable for American families and small businesses is not a mystery. Under President Joe Biden, Democrats have added trillions of dollars to our debt through their wasteful Green New Deal, Build Back Better, and “Inflation Act” agenda. To call these spending sprees “sugar highs” for our economy would be generous. They have been disastrous, adding more than $1000 per month to the average Nebraska household costs since January 2021 while earnings failed to keep up. In contrast to the irresponsible policies coming from the White House, we need a strategy to fight inflation and incentivize steady, robust economic growth. This can only come through a long-term vision which recognizes the diverse economic circumstances for households and businesses across our country, rejects overregulation, and restores of the dignity of work and opportunity to give Americans a path to prosperity. Contrary to the shortsighted Biden agenda, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) grew real wages for American workers, outperformed federal revenue projections, and benefited Americans across the income spectrum. We did this through our efforts to ensure the tax code rewarded farms, ranches, and small businesses who invested in productivity and adding jobs. We also did this by ensuring our tax cuts rewarded working families the most—doubling the guaranteed deduction to ensure the first $24,000 a married couple earns is tax free (now $29,200 thanks to inflation adjustments) and doubling the child tax credit to $2,000 per child to help working parents meet their everyday expenses. A bill we passed out of the Ways and Means Committee and the House at the start of this year, which is currently being held up in the Senate, would index the 2017 version of the child tax credit for inflation while allowing the parents of larger families who work to claim the credit for each child concurrently, rather than consecutively as they are currently required to. Because of the success of TCJA, Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee announced this week we have formed ten teams to hold listening sessions with American families and job creators and promote both proven and innovative tax policies. I will chair the committee’s Rural America Tax Team, which will meet with rural Americans and produce recommendations for the next generation of tax reform in 2025. I am very glad that Reps. Randy Feenstra, from across the river in Iowa’s 4th District, and Michelle Fischbach, who represents the largest agriculture district in Minnesota will be helping lead the effort as vice-chairs. Ensuring our tax code reflects the unique challenges facing the wide spectrum of Americans, including those of us in rural communities, can mean the difference between solvency or insolvency for family farms and small businesses. To secure prosperity for the future, we must preserve and build on the gains of TCJA. ###"
April 20,Tom McClintock,R,Calif.-5,HR 8038 Sanctions and TikTok Ban: No.,"Dear Friend, I hope you have had a good week. I wanted to share an update on the work I did this week while back home in our district. On Monday, I celebrated Earth Day by taking a bike ride through Arlington Heights. In March, I secured $480,000 to allow the Village of Arlington Heights to build a safe and accessible walk and bike path connecting the Palatine Trail with the Prospect Heights Trail. This connectivity will allow people to easily access destinations without the use of cars, providing them with vital physical activity and reducing their carbon footprint. Earth Day is a time to celebrate the incredible planet we live on and fight for its future. It is also reminder that the climate crisis isn't just a challenge — it's an opportunity to make investments in a cleaner future. Efforts like these are essential to encouraging people to reduce their reliance on gas powered transit, and transition to more efficient, environmentally friendly alternatives. On Thursday, I held my annual LGBTQIA+ roundtable, which hosts activists from across the Chicagoland area. It is an important chance to discuss the current state of LGBTQIA+ affairs and share some of the work I am doing to expand opportunities and strengthen protections for the LGBTQIA+ community. The event was moderated by Center on Halsted's CEO, Joli Robinson. On Thursday night, I viewed the many incredible Congressional Art Competition submissions from Illinois' 5th district. Polina Popandopulo, a student from Ridgewood High School, was declared the winner for their submission, ""Best Buddies Down on the Farm."" This piece, along with the other winning submissions from congressional districts around the country, will hang in the U.S. Capitol for the next year. Every spring, the Congressional Art Competition is an opportunity to appreciate the rich artistic talent of the young people in my district. This year’s competition was no different. From oil on canvas to photography to scratchboard— I was incredibly impressed by the potential on display. I am happy to congratulate Polina on their fine work. It will be a wonderful representation of our district's talent for the thousands of visitors to our Capitol from around the world. Don't forget, our office is always here to help.

I took the opportunity to speak from the House floor in favor of the measures, quoting John F. Kennedy’s 1961 inaugural address that the United States “shall pay any price…to assure the survival and success of liberty.” I commended Speaker Mike Johnson for bringing the Ukraine aid bill to the floor at the risk of his speakership and was pleased to see that these votes give Ukraine and Israel the capabilities they need to protect their citizens and gives Ukraine a fighting chance in its defense against Russia. See my release and my speech on the votes here.   Applauding Biden Administration Rule on Cash Refunds for Flight Cancellations On Wednesday, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg announced the release of a rule making it easier to obtain cash refunds when airlines cancel flights. When airlines are responsible for flight delays or cancellations, or do not provide the services that their customers pay for, passengers should be made whole, not tied to airline vouchers or travel credits. I’m pleased that the Department of Transportation has implemented many of the protections in my Cash Refunds for Flight Cancellations Act and Forbidding Airlines from Imposing Ridiculous (FAIR) Fees Act. See my release here.  Attending Grand Opening of Orange Mound Library  Later today, I will attend the grand opening of the Orange Mound Library in the renovated Melrose High School for which I secured $3 million in community project funding. The federal funding for Melrose is leading to a profound transformation of the neighborhood, and the library will be an Orange Mound jewel for years to come.  Meeting with Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Members  On Wednesday, I met with members of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority and discussed their priorities in the areas of economic empowerment, social justice, education and health care. They are a dedicated and inspiring group and do a lot of good work in our community, and I was pleased to hear their perspectives.  Urging Immediate Release of OSCE Staffers Held in Ukraine  On the second anniversary of the arrest of three Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) observers working in Ukraine, I released a statement as its Parliamentary Assembly’s Special Representative for Political Prisoners calling for their immediate release.

Clarke (NY-09) released the following statement regarding reports that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has delayed plans to ban menthol cigarettes: “The tobacco industry has a long history of strategically marketing their products to Black and brown communities, particularly through the use of menthol cigarettes. It’s important for the federal government to recognize and address the harmful impact tobacco has on our communities. However, regardless of the administration’s decision to delay action, I am concerned about how the enforcement of the ban could exacerbate existing, harmful racial bias in our police system. America has a history of over-policing Black and brown communities, and the harms caused by this bias have had an incalculable impact. I believe we can both create more equitable public health policies and heal the health disparities that plague Black and brown Americans. The health and safety of every American is paramount, and I look forward to working alongside the administration moving forward.” ###

Chris Smith (R-NJ), Chair of the House Global Human Rights and International Organizations Subcommittee, called the recently released report on the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) “an absolute whitewash aimed at covering up the antisemitism, violence and hate that has poisoned the agency for decades.”             Smith, the author of legislation to ban US funding for UNRWA, said “the grotesque flaws in the report further underscore how UNRWA apologists have operated with impunity over the years trying to deceive and vindicate the actions of this appalling agency. No one should be fooled.”             Officially called the report of the Independent Review Group, the document is widely referred to as the Colonna report after its chief author.             “From the very beginning, the Colonna report never aimed to be anything but a total whitewash,” Smith continued. “Senior officials connected to the report repeatedly stated that their goal was to ‘reassure donors’ and ‘provide the donors with further cover.’”             “It’s no coincidence that the staff that conducted the review—from its leadership on down—was comprised entirely of individuals and organizations with long histories of dismissing concerns over UNRWA’s infiltration by Hamas and its blatant promotion and complicity in murderous antisemitism,” said Smith. “Naturally, they produced a ‘report’ that ignores grave abuses and proposes cosmetic reforms.”             “UNRWA remains an unreformable, terror-complicit agency that teaches Palestinian children to hate Jews and glorifies suicidal martyrdom and the evisceration of Israel as a state,” Smith said. “It is a child soldier factory—and no bogus report can change that fact.”             “It’s long past time for the US and the rest of the world to move beyond this Hamas-ridden UN agency and find an alternative that does not promote, espouse, or affiliate with entities or individuals that advance violence, terrorism and antisemitism,” said Smith.             Smith, who has chaired three congressional hearings over the past ten months on UNRWA’s unbridled antisemitism, is the author of the Stop Support for UNRWA Act (HR 7122)—which would permanently prohibit US contributions to UNRWA. Elements of Smith’s legislation were incorporated into appropriations legislation and signed into law in March to prohibit US funding for UNRWA for one year. ### Chris has three offices dedicated to constituent services.

April 26,Bruce Westerman,R,Ark.-4,Happy Arbor Day,"Washington Times America continues to fund both sides of conflicts and wars. This is typified by the latest Israel aid portion of the package voted on by the House of Representatives. Almost half of the Israel aid package goes to “humanitarian” purposes, with deference to how to distribute the $9 billion left in the hands of the Biden administration — yes, the same Biden administration that has taken the position of the “two-state solution.” That is to say, President Biden, who is kneeling to the base of the Democratic Party, which exclaims, “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,” has arranged for up to $9 billion to be sent to Gaza. The same Gaza that has been controlled by Hamas for more than a decade. The same Gaza that is ostensibly governed by the Palestinian Authority, which has honored and given bounties to suicide bombers who have indiscriminately killed Israeli civilians. Up to $9 billion to the same Gaza that has acknowledged that Hamas has been hijacking most, if not all, of the humanitarian aid that Israel has facilitated. That Hamas. The Hamas that steals food and medicine and converts it into use for the terrorists while starving the people in Gaza. We, the House of Representatives, voted to give upward of $9 billion to Gaza/Hamas, which takes the pressure off of Iran, which has been financially supporting Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and other terrorist organizations. The package passed in the Senate on Tuesday and will be signed by the president this week. Who will determine the distribution of the funds? None other than the hapless Biden regime. The same regime that insists that Israel recognize the right of statehood of an area that houses the soulless, ruthless terrorists of Hamas. The Hamas terrorists who have sworn to annihilate Israel. The Biden regime, now captured by antisemitic radicals who want the genocidal eradication of Israel, insists that Israel engage in a one-sided cease-fire. It has demanded that Israel stop attacking Hamas animals and let Hamas regroup. Israel has offered a cease-fire seven times, but Hamas refuses because Israel demands that Hamas (which broke a cease-fire when it barbarically attacked Israel on Oct. 7) also lay down its weapons. Even the funding that goes to Israel in the aid package will be leveraged, directed and controlled to a large extent by the Biden regime. Thank goodness that the ongoing, annualized payment of more than $3 billion, which has been on autopilot since 2018, is in the process of delivery, as it has fewer Biden strings. Does Israel need help? Of course. That is why the best thing that House Speaker Mike Johnson has done was to push a package that provided military and humanitarian aid to Israel last November. Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer and Mr. Biden opposed that package because it was paid for instead of being tacked onto our national debt. The need to help Israel is also why additional legislation was proposed, including my bill HR 7271. The speaker failed to move on that bill because, he said, “The Senate won’t pass it.” So, the Schumer-Biden cabal, which refused to pass and sign into law an aid package that passed out of the House on a bipartisan vote last November, insisted that its proposal, which appeases the Democrats’ antisemitic base, be brought forward instead. The Schumer-Biden cabal also demanded that the entire Senate package of aid to Ukraine ($61 billion), Israel ($23 billion) and Taiwan ($2.5 billion) be passed. And so, it was. And that’s how we end up funding both sides of the Israel-Hamas war. Democrats refuse to supply aid to Israel unless four things happen: (1) There cannot be a pay-for; the cost of the aid must be added to our national debt; (2) No funding for Israel unless Ukraine also gets funded; (3) To appease the antisemitic Democratic base, there has to be money going to Gaza-Hamas and (4) There cannot be U.S. border security policy tied to the Ukraine funding, contrary to what Mr. Johnson promised privately and publicly, dozens of times. Last word. For at least three reasons, we know that assistance for Ukraine, not Israel, was the main objective for Democrats, who continue to kneel to their antisemitic base: (1) It was the Ukrainian flag that Democrats were waving on the floor after the vote last Saturday, not the Israeli flag; (2) Democrat Gerry Connolly brazenly claimed “the Ukrainian-Russian border is our border” without mention of the need to protect our true own border or Israel’s border and (3) while almost half of the Israel funding will likely be used to refurbish and rearm Hamas, there is no demand that nearly half of the Ukraine aid goes to the enemy who brutally attacked and continues to fight Ukraine. If the first Israel aid package of last November was the best thing Mr. Johnson has done, this last legislation (which came to the House as one bill and returned to the Senate as one bill, not four separate bills) is one of the worst.

April 26,Bennie Thompson,D,Miss.-2,Thompson Report May 2024 Edition,"April 25, 2024 BOSTON – Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) issued the following statement on peaceful student protests. “Peaceful protest is a central tenet of our democracy and students standing for justice have often been a catalyst for much-needed change. From the 1960s civil rights movement, the Vietnam War protests, the struggle for gender equality, and the movement for Black lives, to the global movement for peace in Israel and Palestine, many of the rights we tout today were earned thanks to the sweat equity of students demonstrating on college campuses across the nation. “Every student, regardless of background or faith, has a right to feel safe and show up in the world without fear or discrimination — and we must ensure that those exercising their right to free speech are met with dignity and respect, not criminalization. “That is why I am deeply concerned about misinformation that aims to undermine this movement, outside agitators that detract from peaceful solidarity actions, and the aggressive response by law enforcement to students peacefully protesting across the country. The National Guard or riot police should not be called in response to students’ peaceful freedom of expression. Let me be clear: we absolutely should not repeat the mistakes of generations past, and history has its eyes on us.  “I call on university administrators to ensure that there are no academic repercussions for peaceful student protestors, and I urge law enforcement — at all levels of government — to exercise restraint. Safety for all students must be the priority. “I am grateful to students nationwide and across the Massachusetts 7th — at Emerson, Northeastern, MIT, Tufts, Boston University, Harvard, and more — who are raising their voices and putting their bodies on the line to press for action to save lives in Gaza. That is what this movement is about. We cannot lose sight of the horrific injustices that Palestinians in Gaza are facing and I am proud to stand in solidarity with peaceful protestors.  “My office is monitoring the situation at campuses in our district and I will continue pushing federally for a lasting bilateral ceasefire in Gaza to save lives, return the hostages, and deliver much-needed humanitarian aid to the region. From Massachusetts to the Middle East, our destinies are tied.” Since the horrific October 7th attack, Congresswoman Pressley has consistently and stridently called for a ceasefire to save lives, return all hostages, and surge humanitarian aid to Gaza. Last week, Rep. Pressley delivered a floor speech in which she called for urgent de-escalation in the Middle East and renewed her calls for a ceasefire in Gaza to prevent a broader regional war. Throughout the Israel and Hamas conflict, Rep. Pressley has been a vocal and consistent advocate of diplomacy, de-escalation, and saving lives. ### Washington DC Office 402 Cannon HOB

April 26,Bennie Thompson,D,Miss.-2,Thompson Report May 2024 Edition,"Asbury Park Press app. logo Jerry Carino - Asbury Park Press Staff Writer  In early 2022, longtime Wall High School art teacher Jill Alexander shipped four of her oil paintings to an exhibit in Denver with a bit of trepidation. She’d created the works — scenes from Cuba inspired by travel there — in the presence of her ailing mother; they lived together in Wall and Jill was her caregiver.    
 “It was uplifting for her when there wasn’t a whole lot to be uplifted about,” Jill Alexander said.
 Carol Alexander died of bone-marrow cancer in 2020. Now Jill was loaning the paintings to an art show run by an old classmate, who had put out a call for contributors, and she “had a funny feeling” about parting
with them. “My husband, when I was packing them up, said, ‘Are you sure you really want to do this?’” Jill recalled. 
She never saw them again.
 Eight works from the exhibit, including her paintings, were stolen from the gallery — a pop-up exhibit in the foyer of a Denver office building. Security footage showed a man dressed in black stuffing them into a duffel bag. Two years later, despite a promising lead, the case remains unsolved. It faded into a bureaucratic haze before a passing conversation got the attention of U.S. Rep. Chris Smith, whose interest has revived the investigation.

 The case goes cold The Denver exhibit, dubbed “The Waiting Room Gallery,” was the brainchild of Dan Drossman — a classmate of Alexander’s from their days in the New York School of Visual Arts’ masters program. Alexander, a Wall native who at the time was working on an illustrated children’s book that has since been published, never made it out there. Instead, she heard second-hand from a friend in Denver that the exhibit had been burglarized. “I thought, ‘There’s no way Dan Drossman would not have called me,’” she said. But he didn’t. Alexander had to call him for confirmation. Eventually, she learned that the gallery was not insured. Three of her paintings were listed at a sale price of $4,000, and the fourth was listed at $6,000. Drossman did set up a GoFundMe campaign that netted $3,000 for Alexander, although that wasn’t her primary concern. “I just want these paintings back,” she said.
 Denver police assigned a detective to the case, and Alexander said Drossman told her that a QR code in the exhibit had been scanned by the thief’s phone — so authorities had an IP address. Then, nothing. “The detective in charge never returned any of my messages,” Alexander said. She later learned the detective retired.
 
Finally, a breakthrough Each year, Smith’s office runs a Congressional Art Competition for students throughout his district (this year’s concludes May 3 with a reception and awards ceremony at Community Medical Center in Toms River). Alexander’s students have been regular contributors. Last year Smith’s district director, Jeff Sagnip, asked art teachers to submit a work for display. Alexander told him she would make some prints. “Why prints?” Sagnip asked. “That’s when I told him the story,” Alexander said. “I don’t feel comfortable; I haven’t put any work in any galleries since this happened.” 
Word reached Smith, he made some calls, and before long Alexander’s phone started ringing “The FBI reached out to me,” she said. “And Denver police put a new detective on it, and he contacted me.”
 Just last week, the FBI added the four missing paintings to its online National Stolen Art File. And Denver police posted a $2,000 reward for anyone with information that leads to the recovery of any of the works that disappeared from the exhibit. Alexander said investigators “are trying to obtain a warrant information for the two different IP addresses that pinged after the theft, so they can get to the bottom of who they belong to.” Most of all, she has the peace of mind of finally being heard. “For months I was so distraught after this happened. I was calling and emailing and nobody ever got back to me,” she said. “Now this after one simple conversation, so I am beyond grateful.” If nothing else, there are valuable real-world lessons for Alexander to impart on her students. “I tell them, ‘First, if you are looking to show your artwork somewhere, you have to make sure there is insurance at the space,” she said. “And No. 2, you should probably visit it. I don’t know I would send work somewhere (unseen) again. See the space and get a feel for it. “If it doesn’t feel right, maybe it isn’t right.”

April 26,Adrian Smith,R,Neb.-3,Keys to Steady Economic Growth,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Representative Pramila Jayapal (WA-07) is today announcing that she helped to secure $16 million for the Northwest Seaport Alliance (NWSA) from the Federal Highway Administration to deploy 36-58 zero-emission drayage trucks through vehicle purchases and development of charging/fueling infrastructure in the Seattle-Tacoma region.  “Washington’s ports are vital to our economy, our supply chains, and our way of life here in Seattle.  Ensuring these charging hubs are fully funded and given the resources needed to build and maintain clean energy infrastructure will protect our environment, our communities, and our economy,” said Jayapal. “This project will ensure that our cargo hauling services are modernized and will also drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions which disproportionately damage the air quality of communities near our seaports and along major freight corridors.” “The Northwest Seaport Alliance is deeply grateful to Congresswoman Jayapal for her leadership in helping secure $16 million in funding from the Federal Highway Administration’s Reduction of Truck Emissions at Port Facilities Grant Program,” said Kristin Ang, Port of Tacoma Commission President and The Northwest Seaport Alliance Co-Chair. “These funds will be instrumental in advancing our Zero-Emission Drayage Truck Incentive Program and accelerating the transition to zero-emission drayage trucks in the Puget Sound.” “The Managing Members of The Northwest Seaport Alliance have introduced bold policies aimed at eliminating seaport-related Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2040, and Scope 3 emissions by 2050 or sooner,” said Hamdi Mohamed, Port of Seattle Commission President and The Northwest Seaport Alliance Co-Chair. “Securing grant funding from programs like the Reduction of Truck Emissions at Port Facilities is critical to the successful transition to zero emissions operations for truck drivers. These funds will also support the network of charging infrastructure needed by truck drivers across the region.” This grant is a further step toward the transition to clean energy at the Port of Seattle. The effort to create the charging infrastructure for a zero-emission drayage fleet will help to reduce diesel particulate emissions in near-port communities experiencing significant health disparities and support the vitality of regional manufacturing and industrial centers and many small and medium-sized businesses. This project will benefit near-port communities such as the Duwamish Valley, South Park, and Georgetown and port workers by reducing the health impacts associated with diesel exhaust. Children who live in the Duwamish Valley have among the highest rates of hospitalization due to asthma compared with any other neighborhood in Seattle and life expectancy in Georgetown and South Park is eight years shorter than the city’s average. This funding is in addition to the $850,000 Jayapal secured for the program in the 2024 federal budget. Jayapal also supporteda $12 million investment to support this project from the newly established Federal Zero-Emission Charging and Infrastructure Grant Program.

      Image     916-786-5560202-225-2511Email Me Washington, D.C. - Congressman Tom McClintock (CA-05) today delivered the following remarks on the House floor.  The Congressman voted AYE on HR 8034, HR 8035 and HR 8036: Mr. Speaker: Ukraine and Israel are in growing danger of running out of arms and ammunition while China casts a hungry eye on Taiwan.  History warns us of allowing aggression to grow unchecked and of how quickly events in an unstable world can unravel.
Profligate spending is exhausting our resources and damaging our economy, but as Reagan reminded us, defense is not a budget issue.  You spend what you need to spend – and although the defense of these besieged nations is one step removed from our own – it would be good to keep it that way.
I regret that the three military aid bills are larded up with $20 billion of economic handouts, but we’re out of time and out of options.  I’m afraid it is the price we now have to pay for months of dithering in this House.  Without these bills today, we and the world risk a future butcher’s bill that is incalculable.

April 26,Yvette D. Clarke,D,N.Y.-9,CLARKE ISSUES STATEMENT ON FDA DECISION TO DELAY MENTHOL BAN,"Subscribe to receive the latest news, insights, and updates directly to your inbox. TAMPA, FL — U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor (FL-14) led the entire Florida Democratic congressional delegation in urging the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to step in to stop Governor Ron DeSantis and the State of Florida from ripping health coverage away from tens of thousands of children who currently rely on the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), known as Florida KidCare.  A newly-enacted federal reform requires all state’s to maintain continuous coverage for children under age 19 for one year after they have qualified for Medicaid and CHIP. Since the new law went into effect on January 1, 2024, Gov. DeSantis and the State of Florida have wrongfully cut off 22,500 children from the care they need – the only state in the country to do so. Florida also is suing the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to upend the new coverage law for the right to continue to disenroll children from Florida KidCare.  “While the Florida Legislature voted to expand Florida KidCare eligibility to children with family incomes up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL), we urge you not to approve the State’s requested punitive premium structure,” the lawmakers write. “Florida’s costly barrier to coverage runs counter to Congressional intent. Congress clearly intended that 12-month continuous eligibility be effectuated without any barriers or roadblocks so that children would receive care and coverage under CHIP.” “As members of Florida’s congressional delegation, we are hopeful that the State will follow through with the proposed expansion of KidCare – and do so in a way that follows the law – allowing up to 165,000 more of our youngest neighbors to have access to high-quality coverage,” the lawmakers concluded. “Florida children should not experience harmful and unlawful gaps in their coverage, be exposed to unaffordable premiums and be treated more harshly than children from other states.” The full letter is available here and below:   April 25, 2024 The Honorable Chiquita Brooks-LaSure Administrator Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 200 Independence Avenue SW Washington, DC 20201
 The Honorable Daniel Tsai The Deputy Administrator and Director Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services 200 Independence Avenue SW Washington, DC 20201   RE: Florida’s Section 1115 Research and Demonstration Waiver Request for Florida KidCare Eligibility Extension Dear Administrator Brooks-LaSure and Deputy Administrator Tsai: As members of the Florida congressional delegation, we write with deep concern about the premium penalties in the state’s proposed five-year Section 1115 waiver for Florida’s Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), known asFlorida KidCare. While the Florida Legislature voted to expand Florida KidCare eligibility to children with family incomes up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL), we urge you not to approve the State’s requested punitive premium structure. Florida’s costly barrier to coverage runs counter to Congressional intent. Congress clearly intended that 12-month continuous eligibility be effectuated without any barriers or roadblocks so that children would receive care and coverage under CHIP.
 In the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 (CAA), Congress enacted legislation that definitely requires state Medicaid and CHIP programs to provide 12 months of continuous eligibility for children under the age of 19.1 This protection went into effect on January 1, 2024 with explicit directives for states to keep children continuously enrolledin Medicaid and CHIP for one year with two exceptions: the child reaches age 19 or the child ceases to be a resident of that particular state. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) later released guidance to states outlining three more exceptions to 12 months of continuous eligibility that are critical to protecting program integrity: the child or guardian requests a voluntary termination, the State determines eligibility was erroneously granted, or the child is deceased. CMS subsequently issued a Frequently Asked Questions document clarifying that there is no exception to continuous eligibility for non-payment of premiums in Medicaid or CHIP—the only exceptions are the five outlined above. The FAQ document confirms that states like Florida will continue to have the option to institute an enrollment fee in CHIP and require payment of the first month’s premium prior to enrollment. While we are pleased that the State of Florida enacted legislation to expand KidCare coverage to more childrenup to 300% of the federal poverty threshold, the State is creating barriers to care that appear unlawful. The waiver estimates that the State expects to enroll over 14,500 currently uninsured children between 200 and 300% of the FPL in the expanded KidCare in the first year, and nearly 165,000 additional children by the end of the five-year demonstrationperiod. Yet the waiver request also proposes new monthly premiums in six income-based tiers, ranging from $17 to $195 per month per family, with automatic increases of three percent each year. Unfortunately, the waiver submission strongly suggests that Florida intends to continue its practice of wrongfully disenrolling children for failure to pay the monthly premiums, which runs counter to the new continuous eligibility protection. Additionally, we believe the suggested premium structure in Florida’s Section 1115 waiver request is likely to bea significant financial barrier for children in lower income working families. Florida is one of a handful of states thatcharges premiums to children at income levels below 150 percent of the FPL, and State data has shown that thousands of children lost coverage monthly or were determined ineligible for initial enrollment due to non-payment of premiums in KidCare in the past.5 The proposed six-tier system will add to the administrative burden faced by state employees and to confusion by families, and the proposed annual three percent increase is likely to exacerbate these issues. Concurrently, the State has filed a lawsuit in federal court against CMS, claiming that states should be allowed to terminate children from their CHIP coverage for nonpayment of premiums despite the CAA’s new protection.6 We haverecently learned that the state has disenrolled 22,576 current KidCare enrollees since January 1, 2024, in contravention to federal law.7 Florida is the only state in the country that we are aware of that is brazenly disregarding the new federal protection for children. This is not happening in a vacuum. Since the Medicaid unwinding began last spring, the number of childrenenrolled in Medicaid has declined by over 460,000, a 17.1% decline in covered children.8 It is unclear what has happened to the coverage of the vast majority of these children, but the net enrollment in Florida KidCare has onlybeen 49,000, a large discrepancy which bears  review.9 We also know that Florida has a high number of procedural disenrollments: of the 1.35 million total Floridians who have lost their coverage during the unwinding, 70% were for procedural reasons, not because the individual wasno longer eligible for the program.10 Research from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) indicatesthat ¾ of children expected to lose Medicaid during the unwinding are very likely to remain eligible for Medicaid – afinding which suggests that children who lose Medicaid for procedural reasons are much more likely than adults to become uninsured.11 While the State has not disaggregated the data by age, there are numerous stories of children losing coverage inappropriately, which results in children missing needing care and families risking medical debt.12 13This led to Secretary Becerra sending Governor DeSantis a letter because Florida was among the nine states with the largest number or highest percentage of disenrolled children during the unwinding. The letter from HHS stronglyencouraged the state to adopt strategies and waivers to help children to maintain needed access to care, none of which Florida has adopted. Children have unique health care needs, and access to consistent health coverage is critical for their development and well-being, allowing them to grow into healthy adults. Positive effects of health coverage for children include timely access to care and reductions in mortality, emergency care usage, and avoidable hospitalizations, as well as lesschronic disease in adulthood, higher rates of graduation, increased college enrollment, and higher future wages. Medicaid is a particularly strong program for children, with no waiting or special enrollment periods, entitlement toservices, and coverage of all medically necessary services. 14 Research has shown that children who are disenrolled for all or part of a year are more likely to have fair or poor health care status compared to children with continuous coverage.15 Not only does continuous eligibility for children improve their short- and long-term health outcomes, it reduces financial barriers to care, promotes health equity, and is cost-effective for families and states. Reduced churn greatlylowers the administrative burden on states, who are no  longer tasked with conducting repeated eligibility reviews and re-enrollments.16 Continuous eligibility also lowers state health care costs by preventing health issues from going undetected and becoming more expensive in the long term. TheCongressional Budget Office (CBO) recently analyzed the effects of Medicaid during childhood on the economy and the budget. The experts found that an additional year of health coverage in childhood under a continuous eligibilitypolicy would improve labor outcomes in adulthood, including higher earnings, hours worked, and productivity, whichwould increase the returns on investment, boost the GDP, and produce positive long-term fiscal effects.17 Finally, we note that the State’s waiver request includes multiple public comments from the state comment period from individuals who were concerned about imposing premiums, the amounts of the premiums, the tier structureof the premiums, and the applicability of the continuous eligibility protection. It is not clear that the State took any action or responded to the public’s concerns: the only acknowledgement of these issues was the letter “N.” As members of Florida’s congressional delegation, we are hopeful that the State will follow through with the proposed expansion of KidCare – and do so in a way that follows the law – allowing up to 165,000 more of our youngest neighbors to have access to high-quality coverage. Florida children should not experience harmful and unlawful gaps in their coverage, be exposed to unaffordable premiums and be treated more harshly than children from other states."

April 22,Andy Biggs,R,Ariz.-5,House Advances $95 Billion of Foreign Aid Under Johnsons Coalition Government,"            New legislation (HR 8125) introduced this week by Reps. Chris Smith (R-NJ) and Tom Suozzi (D-NY) would rename the address of the Hong Kong Economic Trade Office in Washington, DC as 1 Jimmy Lai Way in honor of the renowned Hong Kong human rights defender who remains unjustly imprisoned by Hong Kong authorities.             A 76-year-old democracy advocate and media entrepreneur, Lai has been incarcerated since December 2020 on multiple fabricated charges and is currently serving a sentence of almost six years in prison under politically-motivated fraud charges.             “Jimmy Lai is a man of faith and conviction, someone who fervently believed that Hong Kong’s prosperity and vitality were built on the rights promised to its citizens,” said Rep. Smith, Chairman of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, who nominated Lai for the 2024 Nobel Peace Prize. “For peacefully acting on this belief, he is arbitrarily detained.”             “We will continue to press for Jimmy Lai’s unconditional release and seek ways to raise the diplomatic and reputational costs globally for the Hong Kong government and their Chinese Communist Party masters for their rough dismantling of democratic freedoms and the rule of law in Hong Kong,” said Smith.             “The free world must continue calling attention to the Chinese Communist Party’s crimes in Xinjiang, erosion of democracy in Hong Kong, and saber-rattling against Taiwan,” said Rep. Suozzi. “Naming a street in Washington, DC, after Jimmy Lai, a pro-democracy advocate and journalist standing up for human rights in Hong Kong, will signal to the entire world that the United States stands in solidarity with those who oppose the tyranny and repression of the Chinese government.”             In June 2021, Hong Kong authorities shuttered the Apple Daily newspaper that Jimmy Lai founded and published, and in January 2023, his Next Media company was delisted from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange under government coercion.             “For as long as the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office continues to operate in Washington DC, their new address will symbolize that this champion of freedom stands against their growing authoritarianism and human rights abuses,” said Smith, who has authored legislation (HR 1103) that would require the US Secretary of State to determine if the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Offices in the United States merit the privileges and immunities granted to them by the International Organizations Immunities Act.  Both HR 1103 and its companion bill in the Senate (S 490) have been passed by the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, respectively, and are currently awaiting Floor consideration by both chambers. ### Chris has three offices dedicated to constituent services.

EPA is using the cumulative impact of a suite of rules – a so-called ‘Clean Power Plan 2.0.’ EPA’s rules will accelerate coal plant retirements when our grid reliability and the affordability of the nation’s power supply demand just the opposite. EPA’s refusal to heed the warnings of the experts tasked with keeping the lights on and ensuring a reliable supply of power is alarming and will likely have negative consequences for millions of Americans,” said the Congressional Coal Caucus Co-Chairs.  The Congressional Coal Caucus is the voice of American coal communities in Congress. It represents both eastern and western mining states, and all types of coal produced throughout the country.   ### Enter your email address to get the latest updates straight to your inbox.

April 25,Pramila Jayapal,D,Wash.-7,Jayapal Announces $16 Million in Funding for the Northwest Seaport Alliance,"Dear Friend, I hope you have had a good week. I wanted to take a moment to share a quick overview of some of the work I did this week while in Washington. On Thursday, I sat down with the Governor of Maryland, Wes Moore, to discuss the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore. On March 26, the bridge was hit by a cargo ship, resulting in the death of six bridge workers and a pause in all commercial movement into the port. The Key Bridge, for many, is a lifeline. It connects the people of Baltimore to jobs, ensures U.S. automobile makers expand the footprint of American made vehicles, and is a hub for agricultural exchange. Roughly 30,000 vehicles travel across the Baltimore Key Bridge on any given day, including commuters, long-distance travelers and those carrying goods to-and-from the Port of Baltimore. It is clear that rebuilding this bridge is critical to not just the people of Maryland, but for our economy as a whole. In my role as the lead Democrat on the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Subcommittee, I assured Governor Moore that a timely and efficient rebuild is top of mind. We further discussed how the state and the federal government can work in unison and what next steps are necessary to get this done. On Wednesday, I had the honor of welcoming Chicagoland veterans to Washington, D.C. in partnership with Honor Flight Chicago. Honor Flight is an organization that sponsors a trip to D.C. for World War II, Vietnam and Korean War veterans so that they can visit their respective memorials. Each time I meet with these brave veterans, I am inspired by the stories of their service and sacrifice. It is because of those sacrifices that we can enjoy our freedoms. I was honored to meet with them this past week and offer my sincerest appreciation for their courage and devotion to our country.  Last week, I embarked on a trip to Poland and Ukraine to meet with high-level officials and learn more about how Ukrainian forces are faring against Putin's army. This trip included members of Congress from both sides of the aisle and reaffirmed my belief that supporting Ukraine is not a partisan issue—it is an American one. Therefore on Wednesday, I joined my Republican colleague on BBC News to discuss what we learned from our meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and what must be done in Congress to ensure a Ukrainian victory.

Smith, Co-Founder of the Congressional Uyghur Caucus and Chairman of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China.             “The Chinese Communist Party has committed horrific abuses against the Uyghur Muslims and other ethnic and religious minorities in China,” said Rep. Suozzi, Co-Founder of the Congressional Uyghur Caucus. “This legislation would expand our sanctions effort against Chinese officials perpetrating these crimes and provide technical assistance for documenting human rights abuses.”                “Xi Jinping gave his henchmen the order to ‘show no mercy,’” Smith continued. “From the highest level to the lowest concentration camp guard, we will hold the perpetrators of these horrific abuses accountable.”             The Smith-Suozzi legislation, similar to its companion bill in the Senate introduced by Sens. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Jeff Merkley (D-OR), would:             · Expand sanction authorities for Chinese Communist Party (CCP) officials responsible for the ongoing genocide of the Uyghurs;             · Require a US strategy to deter forced organ harvesting from Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minorities in China;             · Prohibit US government agencies from contracting with any business implicated in forced labor in the XUAR;             · Authorize the US State Department and the US Agency for International Development to provide assistance to victims of genocide and counter propaganda regarding the CCP’s ongoing acts of genocide;             · Promote the preservation of cultural and linguistic heritages repressed by the CCP; and             · Fund organizations documenting atrocities in the XUAR. ### Chris has three offices dedicated to constituent services.

April 20,Tom McClintock,R,Calif.-5,Foreign Aid Package,"Brooklyn, NY – Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries issued the following statement upon the news of the death of Congressman Donald M. Payne, Jr.:Today is a difficult day as we mourn the loss of a beloved public servant, colleague and dear friend. Over his six terms in Congress, Representative Donald M. Payne, Jr. was a tremendous advocate for the people of New Jersey’s Tenth Congressional District, following in the footsteps of his father, the first African American Member of Congress from the state.Rep. Donald Payne, Jr.’s long and valiant career in public service began when he founded the Newark South Ward Junior Democrats and continued at the Municipal Council of Newark and Essex County Board of Freeholders, always fighting for those he was privileged to represent. Don led this fight with vigorous passion and personal conviction, his own courageous battle with Type 1 Diabetes informing much of his life’s work to make our communities safer and healthier. Don Payne Jr. was a strong supporter of the Affordable Care Act and an outspoken advocate for men’s health, leading efforts to provide accessible screening and treatment options for cancer patients.As Chairman of the Railroad Subcommittee for the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Congressman Payne was instrumental in fighting for critical upgrades to New Jersey’s transit system and in crafting the historic Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that has strengthened our nation. A Member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, Don passed legislation to protect America’s children and to make DHS communication more effective during emergencies.Don leaves behind a legacy of relentless determination in the face of adversity. Our nation is forever indebted to Rep. Payne, Jr. for his service and commitment to his community, to the Congress and to the country. I am grateful to my classmate and friend for the role he played in my own public service journey, through our conversations on train rides to and from Washington and our close partnership as Members from neighboring delegations. I join the entire House Democratic Caucus in expressing our sincere condolences to Don’s wife Beatrice, his children Donald III, Jack and Yvonne and the entire Payne family.  ### Subscribe to our e-newsletter that provides updates

April 25,Kathy Castor,D,Fla.-14,"U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor,FL Democrats Urge CMS to Protect Florida Kids from Wrongful and Cruel Health Coverage Disenrollment by State of Florida","April 24, 2024 For Immediate Release Contact: Taylor Haulsee   “They cannot even guarantee the safety of Jewish students. They’re expected to run for their lives and stay home from class.”   WASHINGTON — Today, Speaker Johnson joined the Hugh Hewitt Show ahead of his meeting with Jewish students at Columbia University to discuss the troubling rise of virulent antisemitism on American college campuses.   Click here to listen to the full interview   On the Speaker’s visit to Columbia:    What we’re seeing on these college campuses across the country is disgusting and unacceptable. And we have to – every leader in this country, every political official, every citizen of good conscience – has to speak out and say that this is not who we are in America, and we got to have accountability and that’s what my colleagues and I are going to be working on.    On the national rise of antisemitism:   We have Jewish students who have actually been physically assaulted, they’ve been harassed and been intimidated and threatened. What we need to be doing is,  I love the clip from Tom Cotton. My friend Tom said before your break, we need to revoke federal funding to these universities that they cannot keep control. We need to revoke these student visas for these violent protesters. You don’t have a right to be here and to do this, but Jewish students have a right to be able to peacefully attend classes.   They’re trying to get an education, and this is just madness. And you know, I’ve seen some of these man on the street interviews with some of these kids who are protesting. You and I both know the vast majority of them have no idea what they’re talking about. They don’t know the facts. Some of them are denying that October 7 even happened. I mean, it’s just ridiculous. And we’re calling upon and demanding these university officials to get control. This situation is just completely out of control right now.   On Democrats failure to counter antisemitism in their party:   I’ll tell you that the real problem we have right now is that we’re not getting strong leadership, obviously from the White House or even some Democrats in Congress. I mean, the White House is caving to the antisemitic, I call it the pro-Hamas wing of the party. Now they backpedaled on their support for Israel. I mean, if you get members of Congress refusing to denounce even the chants of death to America, they just go silent. They won’t call that out and some members, Democratic members of Congress, are even calling these antisemitic mobs peaceful protesters and defending the harassment, intimidation and all the rest. So it’s really become a serious problem. And they’re allowing mob rule to overtake the American ideals of free speech and the free exchange of ideas and in the free exercise of religion. This is not who we are.   On the national security supplemental:   I know that history is going to judge this well. It was the right thing to do. This is a this is a very dangerous time. We truly do have a new Axis of Evil. You have China, Russia, and Iran, and often North Korea working together in coordination. They’re funding one another’s aggression. And the reason you and I both know, and you highlight this all the time, the reason this is happening is because the current president is projecting weakness on the world stage and our adversaries are acting aggressively and provocatively, and taking advantage of that.   So, we had this moment in time, Hugh, this historic question: would America stand by our allies stand by Israel, the beleaguered people of Ukraine in this pivotal moment? Or would we shrink back and, in my view, abdicate our obvious responsibility and role in the world? I don’t believe we need to be the world’s policeman. I don’t believe that is our burden. But I do believe that the perception of a strong America is essential on the world stage. And I think the Congress has acted to make sure that happens.   ###

Smith,R,N.J.-4,"<span class=""kicker"">Hong Kong human rights defender honored with street name </span>Legislation introduced by Smith, Suozzi would rename Hong Kong Economic Trade Offices address in Washington DC as 1 Jimmy Lai Way","Today, U.S. Congressman Henry Cuellar, Ph.D. (TX-28) celebrated the Senate passage of his bill renaming the Del Mar Post Office in Laredo after local, fallen military heroes Lance Corporal David Lee Espinoza, Lance Corporal Juan Rodrigo Rodriguez, and Sergeant Roberto Arizola, Jr. The legislation now heads to the President’s Desk, where it will be signed into law. “Lance Corporal David Lee Espinoza, Lance Corporal Juan Rodrigo Rodriguez, and Sergeant Roberto Arizola, Jr. paid the ultimate sacrifice in preserving our freedom, and renaming the Del Mar Post Office here in Laredo will forever commemorate their selfless efforts,” said Dr. Cuellar. “Yesterday, the Senate unanimously voted to memorialize these South Texas heroes and ensure their legacy lives on. Thank you to Texas Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz for working with me to get this legislation through the Senate and the entire Texas Congressional delegation for cosponsoring the bill.” “When my son, David, was killed in Kabul in August 2021, Congressman Cuellar immediately reached out to our family to see how he could help. Not only did we receive his full emotional support, he also helped us get a home where David’s brothers and sister could grow up,” said Elizabeth Holguin, mother of Lance Corporal David Lee Espinoza. “Nothing will ever bring my son back. However, my family and I are honored to have the post office display David’s name in his honor. Thank you, Congressman Cuellar, for passing this bill to honor David's memory.” ""My family and I thank Congressman Cuellar for passing this bill for my brother. It is a great honor knowing his name will forever be remembered as a hero,” said Ricardo Arizola, brother of Sergeant Roberto Arizola, Jr.                      “My son was a selfless human being who lived to serve others and his community. After his military term was up, he wanted to come home and join the local police department,” said Juana Maria Rodriguez, mother of Lance Corporal Juan Rodrigo Rodriguez. “May this post office now embody my son’s values of honor, service, and sense of duty. Thank you, Congressman Cuellar, for helping us pay tribute to Juan’s ultimate sacrifice.” Lance Corporal David Lee Espinoza was born on July 10, 2001, in Laredo, Texas, but lived in nearby Rio Bravo, Texas, all his life. He graduated from Lyndon B. Johnson High School in 2019. Shortly after graduating, he joined the United States Marine Corps. On August 26, 2021, during the withdrawal from Afghanistan, Lance Corporal Espinoza was one of 13 service members killed by a suicide bombing in Kabul, Afghanistan. He was 20 years old. Lance Corporal Juan Rodrigo Rodriguez lived in El Cenizo, a town near Laredo, where he attended United South High School and was involved in Junior ROTC. He led his group to a Junior RTOC national championship in 1998. After graduating high school in 2000, he joined the United States Marine Forces Reserves. He was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 23rd Marine Regiment, 4th Division, Corpus Christi, Texas. On January 13, 2005, Lance Corporal Rodriguez died in action while conducting combat operations in Anbar Province, Iraq. He was 23 years old. Sergeant Roberto Arizola, Jr. was born in Laredo, Texas, on December 11, 1973. He graduated high school in 1992 and enlisted in the United States Army in 1996. He was assigned to the 297th Military Intelligence Battalion, 513th Military Intelligence Brigade, Fort Gordon, Georgia. Sgt. Arizola had been a border patrol agent in Laredo before being deployed to Iraq in May 2004. His family delayed their son’s birthday party so Sgt. Arizola could attend when he returned, but on June 8, 2005, a day before he was scheduled to return from Iraq, Sgt. Arizola was killed in an explosion near his vehicle in Baghdad, Iraq. He was 31 years old. Dr. Cuellar introduced H.R. 2754 earlier this year to designate the United States Postal Service facility at 2395 East Del Mar Boulevard in Laredo, Texas, as the Lance Corporal David Lee Espinoza, Lance Corporal Juan Rodrigo Rodriguez & Sergeant Roberto Arizola Jr. Post Office Building. A ceremony will be held at a later date to commemorate the name change and honor the Gold Star families.

April 25,Morgan Griffith,R,Va.-9,Congressional Coal Caucus Statement on EPA Rules," Last week, the Palisades Nuclear Power Plant in Covert received a $1.52 billion conditional loan commitment from the Department of Energy to restart operations in 2025. This is great news! I’ve led the bipartisan charge in Congress behind this historic project because it will bring economic opportunity, lower energy costs, and greater energy security for Southwest Michigan.  Repowering Palisades means bringing 800 megawatts of safe, reliable, carbon-free energy generation for more than 800,000 homes - and hundreds of highly skilled, good-paying jobs right here to Michigan’s Fourth Congressional District.  According to Market Van Buren’s Zach Morris, “we’re getting back $259 million of economic impact in our local economy, regionally.” That’s one of the many reasons I, the federal government, the State of Michigan, local officials, chambers of commerce, labor unions, environmental groups, and many others came together in support of this project.  For our nation, this federal investment marks an important milestone. Palisades could be the first-ever recommissioning of a nuclear power plant – a key step in regaining American energy security and independence. The plant’s owner, Holtec International, is also planning to build two industry-first small modular reactor (SMR) units at the site which have the innovative potential to generate even more reliable carbon-free energy.  Leading up to the announcement, I’ve been advocating to position Southwest Michigan at the forefront of our nation’s lower-cost, safe, and reliable energy future. I’m proud to have led the bipartisan congressional letter for a safe and swift review of the loan application that was approved last week.  I’ve been highly engaged at the federal level on this critical issue by pressing the Biden Administration on restarting Palisades, supporting the power purchase agreement with Wolverine Power Cooperative, and visiting Holtec’s innovative manufacturing and research facility to see work being done for Palisades first-hand.   These steps are in addition to discussing how repowering the plant furthers my mission of making our area an even better place to live, work, and raise a family.

"April 24, 2020",Lloyd Doggett,D,Tex.-37,RB: IMPROPER USE OF DISINFECTANTS," April 15th is one of the most loathsome days for Americans: Tax Day. Last Congress, the Democrat Majority and President Biden increased funding for the IRS by roughly $72 billion. This included funding to hire over 87,000 IRS agents with a focus on so-called rich Americans. However, when you look past the window dressing, it’s clear the IRS is still targeting middle-class Americans at an alarming pace.  As of last summer, 63% of new audits have targeted individuals making under $200,000, according to a recent report from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. This report also highlights that despite billions in funding, and a hiring goal of 3,700 to go after the so-called wealthy, the IRS has only hired a whopping 34 people during the first six months.  Already, the IRS hasn’t even been able to execute its top-line objectives, which is consistent with analysis from the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation showing that most of the tax revenue raised from these new agents would come from lower- and middle-income earners. This is why I voted to cut funding for the 87,000 IRS agents and claw back the ridiculously bloated IRS budget. You should be able to keep more of your hard-earned money, not send it to Washington so the IRS can then target you.   Remember, last year, the federal government collected $4.4 trillion in revenue. Washington doesn’t have a revenue problem; it has a spending problem. I do not want the Biden Administration’s IRS targeting middle-class families and small businesses across Van Buren and Berrien counties. I am committed to protecting Americans from governmental overreach and I will continue to battle bureaucrats in Washington over the proper size, role, and scope of the federal government.  My office has helped hundreds of individuals, families, and businesses across Southwest Michigan with issues related to the IRS. We are here to serve you.

April 24,Christopher H. Smith,R,N.J.-4,"Smith, Suozzi introduce legislation to bolster the fight against the Chinese Communist Partys ongoing genocide of Uyghurs"," Over the weekend, Iran launched a direct assault against Israel. I continue to stand with Israel, and completely condemn the actions of Iran.  Iran remains one of the most heavily sanctioned countries in the world. However, as recent as March 2024, the Biden Administration granted sanction waivers to Iran, potentially giving the regime access to billions of dollars. We cannot provide a financial lifeline to the Iranian regime as it continues to support terrorist organizations around the world and now directly attacks our allies.  My bill, the No U.S. Financing for Iran Act, was one of the first considered in the House to hold Iran accountable as well as limit the Iranian regime’s ability to finance terrorism. I am proud to say that H.R. 5921 passed the House with a bipartisan vote of 294-105.  The No U.S. Financing for Iran Act protects our national security interests in three main ways.  First, it prohibits Treasury from issuing licenses that allow U.S. financial institutions to enable trade with Iran.  Second, it further cuts off financing for Iran from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). While Iran is not currently seeking assistance from the Fund, it certainly could as an IMF member country. My bill makes clear that the United States, as the IMF’s largest shareholder, will oppose any such request. This prohibition would extend to the IMF Special Drawing Rights program, which Iran utilized in 2021 to access approximately $5 billion.  Lastly, it extends an existing prohibition against Export-Import Bank financing for Iran.  My bill is targeted. It tightens our grip on the Ayatollahs while permitting licenses to allow for humanitarian aid to continue flowing to the Iranian people.  When Americans deposit their earnings in a U.S. bank or entrust the government with their tax dollars, they do so assuming that the money will not be used in ways that undermine the security of our nation. These are commonsense but long overdue prohibitions to hold the Iranian regime accountable.

Congressman Bob Latta (R-OH5) co-led the bill in the U.S. House and released the following statement: ""This bipartisan bill is a victory for the American people and the United States' national security. The Chinese Communist Party should not use an app to surveil, target, and manipulate American citizens. With this bill set to become law, TikTok will face a choice: separate from Communist China-controlled ByteDance or shut down in the United States - it's that simple.  ""I'm proud to have played a role in shepherding this legislation through Congress - including through the Energy and Commerce Committee. I want to thank the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party for their steadfast leadership on this effort.  ""While this is a necessary step to protect our national security, we have much more work to do. Whether it's standing up to military aggression in the Pacific, safeguarding our communications networks from cyber threats, or preventing the acquisition of American farmland - we will not relent in our efforts to curtail Communist China's malign influence in America and around the globe."""
April 24,Donald W. Norcross,D,N.J.-1,Rep. Norcross Statement on the Passing of Rep. Donald Payne Jr.,"Eminent policymakers and scholars address today’s law and policy challenges By Cristian Rivera January 29, 2024 By 2050, Latinas are expected to make up 13% of the U.S. population, account for 11% of the labor force, and have a median age 11 years younger than their white counterparts. Yet Latinas comprise only 2.5% of all U.S. lawyers, account for less than 1% of all partners in law firms and have never served on the highest court in 44 states. To address this alarming gap in Latina representation and leadership in law and policy, the UCLA Latino Policy and Politics Institute, the Latina Futures, 2050 Lab, the Latina Lawyers Bar Association, and the UCLA Chicanx Latinx Law Review hosted the inaugural Latina Futures: Transforming the Nation Through Law and Policy symposium.  The sold-out event, which took place Jan. 20 and 21 at UCLA’s Luskin Conference Center, brought together nearly 400 prominent Latina scholars, attorneys, politicians, policy leaders and students from across the country to explore today’s legal and advocacy challenges and opportunities through a Latina lens. “This weekend, we are replacing the status quo with forward-thinking, accurate, and necessary contributions from Latina leaders now and well into the future,” said Sonja Diaz, founding executive director of the Latino Policy and Politics Institute and co-founder of Latina Futures, 2050 Lab, in her opening remarks.   The event featured 11 panels and plenary sessions, two fireside chats, a keynote and networking opportunities that touched on a variety of topics, including affirmative action and reproductive justice, the intersectionality of Latina and LGBTQ+ identities, and avenues toward advancing legal and policy reforms that promote equality and inclusion. Participants shared personal and professional experiences that highlighted the need to increase the representation of Latina leaders in decision-making positions. Among the symposium’s 70 speakers was California Chief Justice Patricia Guerrero, the first Latina in this role, who spoke about her journey from the Imperial Valley and the challenges she overcame.  In a fireside chat moderated by Margaret Salazar-Porzio, Mary Murguía, chief judge of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and her sister Janet Murguía, CEO and president of the civil rights and advocacy nonprofit UnidosUS, delved into their paths towards leadership and the hope they have for future leaders to unite Latino communities and the nation in an increasingly divided world. U.S. Rep. Nanette Barragán, a UCLA alumna from the class of 2000, California state Sen. María Elena Durazo, New Mexico state Sen. Antoinette Sedillo-Lopez, and Texas state Rep. Maria Luisa Flores shared their perspectives with Laura Gómez, a professor at UCLA School of Law, on the need for a Latina lens in policymaking across all levels of government. In addition, Vilma Martinez, U.S. ambassador to Argentina and former president and general counsel of MALDEF, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, challenged attendees to take ownership of the future and contribute to a more inclusive and equitable society.  Reflecting on the 50-year anniversary of MALDEF, Martinez told the audience during the program that she felt an initial sense of disappointment because she thought the organization’s work would have been completed by this time. However, she continued, her feelings shifted with her recognition that our nation is built on grand aspirations and ideals — and achieving them is a long and continuous process. Professor Veronica Terriquez, director of UCLA’s Chicano Studies Research Center and co-founder of the Latina Futures, 2050 Lab – shared her vision for the future.  “Together, we will tackle the most pressing social problems by taking an intersectional approach to our work.  We must proceed in ways that are mindful of the diversity of our communities and inclusive of the voices of those often marginalized,” she said. “ We have the potential to inform social, political, and economic changes that benefit the majority of this nation.” Terriquez expressed her hope that the symposium would inspire participants to continue their advocacy and leadership. “I hope you feel energized from this weekend and will continue to fight for our communities,” she told the audience. “This is a long game, and it builds on the work that came before us.”  Stay up-to-date on District 44's latest news, updates and more!

April 24,Henry Cuellar,D,Tex.-28,Rep. Cuellar's Bill to Rename Laredo Post Office After Fallen Servicemembers Heads to Presidents Desk,"By KRISTY HUTCHINGS | khutchings@scng.com PUBLISHED: April 23, 2024 at 2:42 p.m. | UPDATED: April 23, 2024 at 2:43 p.m. WomenShelter Long Beach, a nonprofit serving survivors of domestic violence, will soon build a new transitional housing facility for its clients — with help from a significant chunk of federal funding. Rep. Nanette Diaz Barragán, who represents California’s 44th Congressional District, helped secure $850,000 for the nonprofit’s project. Congress members, during the 2024 fiscal year, were able to submit funding requests to the U.S. House of Representative’s Appropriations Committee for up to 15 community projects within their districts. “We’re looking forward to seeing how the money can make a difference to women and domestic violence survivors in the Long Beach area,” Barragán said in a Monday, April 22, interview. “Our focus was housing women, women empowerment and, of course, breaking the cycle — so this was an easy project to fund.” Barragán presented WomenShelter Long Beach and its various leaders with the $850,000 check during a Monday ceremony. WomenShelter Long Beach will use the funding to purchase and retrofit an existing house or apartment building, which will serve as a transitional housing facility for the nonprofit’s clients. The organization has provided crucial services for women and children since its establishment in 1977 — and offers a comprehensive suite of services for domestic violence survivors, including safe housing, emergency shelter, a 24-hour crisis hotline, counseling, legal advocacy and more. WomenShelter has yet to select a site for the new facility, according to Lisette Flores, the nonprofit’s board president. The location, when selected, won’t be shared publicly to protect future residents, Flores said in a Monday interview. “It could be in the flavor of a home, like what we have now,” Flores said, referencing WSLB’s existing emergency supportive housing shelter. “Or it could be like an apartment building where everyone has their own personal space.” Ideally, according to WomenShelter’s director of development, Nicholas Maddox, the new facility will have six to eight units — which could house multiple people, such a women and their children, to a single room. There isn’t a precise timeline for buying, retrofitting and opening the new facility, Flores said, though the goal is to have the project finished in the next six months to a year. Once open, clients will be able to live in the transitional housing facility for up to a year and the’ll also have access to case management, therapy and employment services. “I can personally say that the services and the work that our advocates do every single day makes a huge impact in everyone’s lives,” Jennifer Costa, WSLB’s director of outreach and education, said Monday. “Knowing that this continued support will be provided — it’s tremendous.” If you or someone you know is experiencing domestic violence, help is available 24/7 through the National Domestic Violence Hotline.

April 24,Christopher H. Smith,R,N.J.-4,On the passing of Donald Payne Jr.,"Brooklyn, NY – Today, Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries released the following statement:The antisemitic rhetoric and intimidation deployed by some students and outside protestors on college campuses in New York City and beyond is completely unacceptable and deeply disturbing. Every American has the constitutional right to free speech and peaceful assembly in the public square. However, intentionally targeting Jews or any community on the basis of race, religion or ethnicity, acts of harassment and the use of physical violence will never be tolerated. No Jewish student or faculty member should fear for their safety on campus or anywhere else in our nation. The effort to crush antisemitism and hatred in any form is not a Democratic or Republican issue. It’s an American issue that should bind us all together. We will continue to do everything possible to protect the Jewish community during this very fraught moment, fight the cancer of antisemitism and redouble our efforts to bring communities together.  Subscribe to our e-newsletter that provides updates

April 24,Mike Kelly,R,Pa.-16,"Kelly: ""We are proudly investing in infrastructure projects all over Butler County""","Brooklyn, NY — Today, Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries released the following statement upon the Senate’s passage of the critical national security package: Congratulations to Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and members of the Senate on swift passage of bipartisan legislation important to America’s national security interests. Led by Chuck Schumer, highly consequential legislation that supports democracy and freedom throughout the world and provides humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza and other theaters of conflict is on its way from the Senate to President Biden’s desk.  The House Republican majority irresponsibly delayed critical security assistance to our democratic allies in Ukraine, Israel and the Indo-Pacific for months, until a bipartisan coalition led by President Joe Biden ultimately prevailed. It was an epic struggle to get to this point.   At every step of the journey, House Democrats provided the votes necessary – procedurally and substantially – to secure military and economic aid for Ukraine, repeatedly breaking with congressional customs and traditions. In the end, House Democrats concluded to a person that standing up for democracy and American leadership of the free world was far more important than letting the GOP civil war crash and burn the legislative process. House Democrats were determined to break the extreme MAGA Republican wing in our chamber, so that pro-Putin Republicans could not break democracy in the free world.  Mission accomplished.

April 8,Bill Huizenga,R,Mich.-4,Weekly Column: Good Jobs and Lower Energy Costs,
April 15,Bill Huizenga,R,Mich.-4,Weekly Column: Reining in the Tax Man,"            U.S. Rep. Chris Smith—Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Global Human Rights Subcommittee and Co-Chairman of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission—today called on the government of Azerbaijan to provide Dr. Gubad Ibadoglu, an economist who has been unjustly imprisoned, with immediate access to medical care following his recent transfer from prison to house arrest:             “This heroic political prisoner suffers from a number of medical conditions, which have been greatly aggravated by the lack of adequate medical care and the cruel conditions of his imprisonment.             “The government of Azerbaijan must facilitate the best medical care possible for Dr. Ibadoglu.             “The Azerbaijani government bears full responsibility for the current state of Dr. Ibadoglu’s health—and that of its other political prisoners, POWs, and ethnic Armenians illegally detained.”             A fierce defender of human rights, Smith has advocated for Dr. Ibadoglu’s release since the time of his arrest last year and has advocated for other political prisoners of the government of Azerbaijan, including Khadija Ismayilova.             In 2015, Smith authored the Azerbaijan Democracy Act to promote democracy and human rights in Azerbaijan, which has one of the most repressive governments in the world. The U.S. government’s report on human rights practices in the country documents many grave abuses—including unlawful or arbitrary killings, torture, harsh and sometimes life-threatening prison conditions, arbitrary detention, political prisoners, and politically motivated reprisal against individuals outside the country. ### Chris has three offices dedicated to constituent services.

Bishop, Jr. (D-GA-2) recently introduced H.Con.Res. 103, legislation that would authorize the use of the U.S. Capitol Rotunda for the lying in honor of Colonel Ralph Puckett, Jr., the last living Medal of Honor recipient for acts performed during the Korean War, and would honor those who served in the Armed Forces of the U.S. during the “Forgotten War” from 1950 to 1953. The Senate companion of this legislation—S.Con.Res. 33—was approved last week by both the Senate and the House of Representatives, allowing COL Puckett to officially lie in honor in the Capitol Rotunda on April 29, 2o24. Congressman Womack said, “Honoring Colonel Ralph Puckett, Jr., the last living Medal of Honor recipient from the Korean War, and his fellow Korean War veterans is the very least we can do to display our immense gratitude for his courageous service to our country. Allowing him to lie in honor in the Capitol Rotunda will pay tribute to his remarkable heroism and provide an opportunity for all Americans to express their appreciation and respect for his service. I’m proud to join my friend Congressman Bishop in this bipartisan effort to underscore our collective recognition of Colonel Puckett’s—and all Korean War veterans’—service and sacrifice.” Congressman Bishop said, “Colonel Ralph Puckett, Jr., was a cherished member of the Columbus community. Already a highly decorated officer whose sacrifices in the line of duty helped keep our country safe, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Honor by President Biden in 2021 for his heroism during the Korean War. He remained an integral part of the U.S. Army family, taking an active role in the life of Fort Moore and its soldiers. It is only befitting that Congress bestows this honor on Colonel Puckett. I want to thank U.S. House Speaker Johnson and Senate Majority Leader Schumer for their support as well as Congressman Steve Womack of Arkansas who joins me as the Republican co-lead of this bipartisan legislation.” As a 30-year veteran of the U.S. Army National Guard and the Chairman of the West Point Board of Visitors, Congressman Womack understands the importance of supporting our military and honoring those who answered the call to serve."
April 24,Glenn Thompson,R,Pa.-15,Thompson Announces Appointment of Mayra Briggs to the U.S. Naval Academy,"TAP Into logo JERSEY SHORE- In response to growing concerns from Belmar, NJ residents over Verizon's plans to install twenty 30-foot 5G towers along the local boardwalk, Representative Chris Smith introduced a new piece of legislation aimed at giving local communities more say in such telecommunications projects. The bill, HR 8082, seeks to overturn Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations that currently streamline the approval process for 5G infrastructure, often sidelining local input. Introduced amid escalating legal disputes involving Verizon and Monmouth County, the legislation targets specific FCC rules established in 2018. These rules include ""shot clocks"" that limit the time town and county governments have to review and approve 5G projects, which Rep. Smith argues unfairly benefit the telecommunications industry at the expense of local governance. ""The heart of my legislation is to restore the critical voice of local residents in decisions that affect the health, safety, and aesthetics of their communities,"" Rep. Smith stated. He emphasized that the advancement of technology should not trample the concerns and values of local citizens. Last year, in a letter to Verizon, Rep. Smith urged the company to reconsider its installation plans and engage more transparently with the community. His legislative action reflects broader tensions between technological expansion and community rights, emphasizing a need for balance and respect for local jurisdictions. Rep. Smith's proposal resonates with broader national concerns about the pace and nature of 5G rollout across the United States, highlighting a pivotal moment in the intersection of technology, regulation, and community rights.

April 24,Glenn Thompson,R,Pa.-15,Thompson Announces Appointment of Samuel Harvey to the United States Military Academy,"Jersey Shore Online-MicroMedia Publications logo   “The Township received a $6,000,000 Congressional District Spending Grant for the Completion of the Railroad Avenue Extension from Musket to South Street and From Lacey Road south to connect into Station Drive,” said Mayor Peggy Sue Juliano. “This includes the completion of the trail.”   Money awarded for the special federal grant can only be used for the cited projects and cannot be redirected to anything else.

  While expressing her gratitude to Congressman Chris Smith (R-4th) for securing funds, the mayor also highlighted the project’s special significance for Lacey. She credited her husband, the late Mayor Nick Juliano, Committeeman Mark Dykoff, and now Ocean County Commissioner Gary Quinn for initiating the discussions to free up traffic on Route 9.   The project encompasses the construction of a new two-lane limited access road running parallel to Route 9, stretching from Lacey Road South to Station Drive and from Musket Drive North to South Street. Additionally, the extension will incorporate a multi-use path known as the Barnegat Branch Rail Trail, creating a vital link in the Ocean County Barnegat Bay Trail.   Two phases of the Railroad Avenue extension were completed in 2017 at a cost of $3 million. Authorities could not move on to further completion because of a lack of money. The start of the project reportedly freed up traffic north of Lacey Road. Sunrise Beach residents also experienced an easier means of getting in and out of their development when the road was first extended.   Nevertheless, the fact remains that congestion is a very real concern on Route 9.   “During peak travel time, the Route 9 corridor in Lacey Township develops heavily, leaving no alternative paths to travel to other parts of the town or its neighboring communities,” said Rep. Smith, who is said to have to have personally secured the funds for the project as one of his congressional earmarks that were signed into law as part of a negotiated budget.   “The extension of Railroad Avenue will not only ease the flow of traffic within Lacey Township but will also improve safety conditions for drivers, passengers, and pedestrians alike,” Smith said.   Drainage issues in the area will also be addressed as part of the overall project estimated at $6,119,345. New construction plans include drainage swales, stormwater piping, and an infiltration basin. These improvements aim to alleviate flooding during storms and enhance overall safety and efficiency for travel on Route 9 during inclement weather.   Township Administrator Veronica Laureigh said that she spoke with Chris Smith’s office about the fact that no one was addressing the traffic on Route 9 and learned of the opportunity for congressional spending and its projected use. She encouraged members of the governing body to apply for funding.   The end result should be completion of a road similar to McKinley Boulevard in Manahawkin that runs parallel to Route 72. The speed limit on Railroad Avenue will remain at 30 mph as required by the initial permit approving the project.   Unlike other municipalities along the Barnegat Branch Rail Trail, Lacey owns the railroad right-of-way. The township acquired rights to the property by way of a tax foreclosure sale in 1994. Ocean County owns the land in other local towns and has used it to develop the Barnegat Rail Trail. Lacey has not turned over its portion to the County but has made an agreement as far as an access easement.   Authorities are waiting for further information concerning when the funds will be made available and will then establish a timeline for the work.  Chris has three offices dedicated to constituent services.

April 24,Robert E. Latta,R,Ohio-5,TO THE PRESIDENT'S DESK: Latta Co-Led Bill to Protect Americans from Communist China-linked TikTok,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Representatives Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and Scott Peters (D-Calif.) and U.S. Senators Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on Tuesday led 14 of their Senate and House colleagues in sending a letter to Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chair Lina Khan urging the FTC to finalize a proposed rule to ban non-compete agreements as soon as possible. In their letter, the members illustrated the myriad harmful effects of non-compete agreements on both workers and the economy and highlighted the anticipated benefits of the FTC’s rule. U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and U.S. Representatives Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), Dwight Evans (D-Pa.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), Greg Casar (D-Texas), Lizzie Fletcher (D-Texas), Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.), Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) and Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) also signed the letter. “The negative effects of non-compete agreements are widespread and pervasive across all sectors of the economy,” the members wrote. “While some special interests would have one believe non-compete agreements are essential tools for protecting sensitive business information and only affect a small handful of well-placed boardroom executives, the evidence paints a different picture. A staggering 30 million workers in the United States are bound by non-competes – a figure that represents roughly 20 percent of the American workforce. In many instances, non-competes are applied to low-wage workers even though, according to a GAO report, businesses admit these workers do not have access to confidential business information. Studies have shown that among workplaces that pay their employees an average of $13, nearly 30% of them apply non-compete agreements to their workers. For employers who are worried about their sensitive business information, other options exist. Non-disclosure agreements, for example, could be used to prevent employees from disclosing business information to their new employer.” The members continued: “To make matters worse, workers from historically marginalized communities are often the most impacted by non-compete agreements. Research suggests that non-compete clauses lower earnings for female and nonwhite workers and that workers with less education experience greater wage loss from non-competes. Non-compete agreements have also been shown to slow innovation and hamper economic dynamism. In the last 40 years, startup growth in the United States has slowed. Research has shown that non-compete agreements reduce firm entry and spinout rates, and that firms founded in states where these agreements are in effect, are more likely to fail than those in states where non-competes are banned.” The members concluded, voicing their support for the FTC’s rule and calling for its swift finalization: “We are pleased that the FTC is taking this much-needed step to protect workers across the country. The proposed Non-competes Clause Rule will help ensure American workers enjoy the freedom to change jobs when they want and remain free from the interference and intimidation that often comes with a non-compete agreement. In addition, the proposed rule would give employers the freedom to compete for talent, which is an essential component of a vibrant and robust job marketplace. Our economy and our country do best when wages increase, and workers can compete for better jobs and better wages. The FTC’s rule on non-compete agreements will bring a welcome change for workers across the country, and we encourage you to finalize it as soon as possible.” Read the full letter HERE.

April 24,Nanette Barragán,D,Calif.-44,UCLA Newsroom:,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE | Contact: Olivia Porcaro 202-225-6165 On April 10th, I was ratified by the House Republican Conference as the new Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee - but not only did I just become the new Chairman, I also became the first Native American to ever Chair this Committee.  As an enrolled member of the Chickasaw Nation of Oklahoma, my tribal heritage is something I am very proud of, and I was very fortunate to witness this culture firsthand while growing up. My great, great grandfather served as the clerk for the Chickasaw Nation Supreme Court, my great grandfather was the Treasurer of Chickasaw Nation, my great aunt, Te Ata Fisher, was a famous actress and storyteller who performed Native American stories all over the world, and my late mother and inspiration, Helen Cole, was the first Native American woman elected to the Oklahoma State Senate.  My family members truly made it a priority of theirs to preserve tribal culture, and, as one of only five Native Americans and Alaska Natives in Congress and the first Native American House Appropriations Committee Chair, it is a top priority of mine to protect our tribes as well.   It is important to remember that Native Americans are the First Americans. They are sovereign nations who governed themselves long before settlers arrived, and they continue to do so today. Through legally binding agreements, such as the federal trust responsibility, the United States is obligated to provide services and federal resources to tribes — a responsibility I have been and will continue to work to ensure is met.   It is critical tribes and the federal government have mutual respect. States and the federal government must work with Native Americans to maintain the integrity of their heritage, culture, and rights. At the same time, the federal government must uphold its constitutional oath to tribes to provide basic resources such as healthcare, education, infrastructure, and law enforcement, among many others, in Indian Country. Tribes do not receive state assistance and cannot tax their own citizens, which is why expanding and promoting economic development within tribal communities and committing these federal resources is so important.   This is why, during my tenure as Chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development, I fought to secure historic gains for traditionally underfunded Native American housing and transportation programs. Specifically, I was able to obtain $1.34 billion for Native American housing programs and $150 million in discretionary appropriations for Tribal Transportation programs in the Fiscal Year 2024 appropriations package. Over the years, I have also fought to secure advanced appropriations funding for the Indian Health Service, ensuring that tribal communities are never at risk of losing healthcare access in the case of a government shutdown.   I have long been, and always will be, an advocate for expanding self-governance wherever possible and ensuring tribes receive the resources they need to take care of their communities because, at the end of the day, tribes are the best at taking care of their people. As Chairman of the full House Appropriations Committee, I will continue to work to set these increases as the standard for this necessary funding in the future.   Lastly, it is important that my fellow members of Congress are informed about the very unique issues concerning Native Americans, the sovereign rights of tribes, and their relationship with the federal government. As the Republican Co-Chair of the bipartisan Congressional Native American Caucus, this is exactly what I strive to do. Tribal issues span to every single House Committee, so it is important to keep Native American issues top of mind as members take up legislation.   In conclusion, tribes have played a very important role in American history. They have greatly influenced this nation and the land on which we live, even before the United States truly came to be. As the longest serving Native American in the House of Representatives, I know that it is an honor and a privilege to be a voice for tribes in Congress, and will continue to ensure that we, as a body, are protecting their autonomy and culture.

I wanted to take a moment to share an update on the work I did this week while in Washington. 1. Hosted Mothers of American Veterans Killed in Action in Ukraine
  This week, as co-chair of the Congressional Ukraine Caucus, I hosted a press conference with three Gold Star mothers of American veterans killed while fighting in Ukraine. These mothers shared their son's stories, explained why they chose to join Ukraine's cause, and made the case for sending additional assistance. These veterans made the ultimate sacrifice to fight for Ukraine's freedom. I believe we must honor their service by helping Ukraine end this war. I was joined by colleagues from both sides of the aisle at the press conference and we made clear our determination to protect Ukraine and the rest of Eastern Europe from Putin's threats.  I recently returned from my third trip to Ukraine since the war began in February 2022. I met with President Zelenskyy and high-ranking military officials who offered insight into the need for further assistance to defend against Russia. 2. Held a Roundtable on Improving Transparency in Government
  On Tuesday, I hosted a roundtable discussion with speakers from a variety of government offices and civil society organizations to identify actionable commitments that advance transparency and bring sunshine to our government. Here in Congress, I am proud to serve as a co-chair and co-founder of the bipartisan Congressional Transparency Caucus. Transparency in government is crucial to our democracy. Our government derives its power from the consent of the governed, and openness and accessibility of government information is essential in establishing public trust and accountability. 3. Joined CNN to Discuss the State of Play in Congress  On Tuesday, I joined CNN MAX with Jim Sciutto to discuss Speaker Johnson's plan to respond to the crises unfolding beyond our borders. After months of delay, the Speaker unveiled his plan to provide critical aid to Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan. As the United States, I believe it is imperative that we lead the fight to save democracy and stand up to tyranny. We also discussed threats from far-right conservatives to remove Johnson as Speaker of the House. I emphasized the importance of focusing on the tasks at hand rather than wasting time with partisan theater. To watch my full interview, click HERE. Don't forget, our office is always here to help.

April 22,Tom Cole,R,Okla.-4,Becoming the First Native American Appropriations Committee Chairman," Email Me(816) 792-3976 It’s an idea as old as our nation—to secure peace, America must project strength. As George Washington said in his 1793 State of the Union address: “If we desire to secure peace… it must be known that we are at all times ready for war.”
That concept, succinctly described by President Reagan as ""peace through strength,"" has been at the core of American foreign policy from the very beginning. Unfortunately, what we’re seeing right now from President Biden is the exact opposite, weakness—and it only invites chaos.
Biden ran on the idea that he would be a ""steady hand"" for foreign policy. Now we know that was an empty promise at best. At worst—an outright lie.
He displayed weakness to the world when he pulled out of Afghanistan without a plan, costing the lives of 13 U.S. servicemembers and thousands of our Afghan allies.
He displayed weakness when he waived sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, turning on the money machine to fund Putin's invasion of Ukraine.
He displayed weakness when he tried to pave the way for the release of $6 billion to Iran and threatened to condition military aid to Israel unless they promised to go easy on Hamas terrorists in Gaza.
Instead of standing with our allies, projecting our strength, and showing that America isn't to be messed with, President Biden has shown weakness at every turn. We cannot allow the President to continue waiving sanctions at whim and negotiating away all our leverage unilaterally. All it does is invite our adversaries to take advantage of our weakness. China—which has long threatened to invade our ally, Taiwan—is watching our every move.
We need to stand up, stand with our allies, and force the President to stand strong for America. Otherwise, our adversaries are going to keep taking advantage of his weakness—and we'll all suffer for it.
Sincerely,
Sam Graves"
April 22,Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan,D,Northern Marianas Islands,Technical Assistance grants awarded,"April 19, 2024 For Immediate Release Contact: Taylor Haulsee     Speaker Johnson joined the Ben Shapiro Show to discuss the national security supplemental   WASHINGTON — Today, Speaker Johnson joined the Ben Shapiro Show to discuss President Biden’s failed foreign policy, the House national security supplemental legislation, and the importance of America projecting strength on the world stage.   Click here to listen to the full interview   On American strength:    I believe in peace through strength. I believe in what Ronald Reagan said, it does not mean that we’re the world’s policemen. It does not mean that American troops should have boots on the ground everywhere. That’s not what we’re for. But to your point, Ben, and you’ve said it well; a strong America is good for stability around the globe. What does that mean? It means the perception of a strong America we’re the last great superpower. We, you know, we’re the greatest nation in the history of the world. It’s not even close. We’re the most free, most benevolent the strongest, the most powerful. And if we don’t act like it, then terrorists and tyrants take over.   The reason that Iran and China and North Korea and Russia right now are acting so provocatively is because we’re projecting weakness on the world stage. Joe Biden’s foreign policy has been an absolute disaster. And that’s what’s got us in this situation. And if we do this little bit of investment here, we can stem the tide, hold them off, hopefully until we get a new president. And that day cannot happen soon enough.   On the House’s leverage with the national security supplemental legislation:   The House is fixing the Senate supplemental bill, the foreign aid bill that was sent to us a few months ago with better policy and better process. And so what we’ve done is we’ve taken, for example, the Ukraine funding elements that are, that are controversial, of course, on our side, we’ve added a loan instrument. We have added the, the REPO Act, which is the use of corrupt Russian oligarchs’ seized assets to support the effort there. We’ve added oversight, accountability, and a strategy shift to force the White House to give us the information and the end game and all the rest. We have an amendment process, so we can address each of these measures on their own merit in four separate bills instead of having them sandwiched together. And everybody can vote their own will and their own conscience and their own constituents. That’s the way this place is supposed to work. And we included tough measures on Russia, China, and Iran, including sanctions and some other innovation. So a very important change in both the process and the policy, and if we had not done this Ben, and this is very important, we would have had to eat the Senate supplemental if, if we had not taken this step, there would’ve been a discharge petition. And that means that a handful of Republicans would’ve crossed over and gotten on board with the Democrats to force it out of my hands and make us take the Senate supplemental as is. That was not an acceptable outcome, and this is the best possible outcome that we can achieve.   On the vital importance of deterring Vladimir Putin:   Look on the Ukraine piece, this is really important to point out. You know, there’s a lot of angst about, you know, quote unquote sending more money to Ukraine, but 80% of the funds that are in this package for Ukraine are literally to replenish American weapons and stocks and facilities. This is America’s defense and industrial base. This is building weapons here at home and refilling our stockpiles really, really important thing for us to do. Ukraine is in a position where they very likely would, would fall. And so this is going to allow them to, to at least hold the line. And I believe then that President Donald Trump is gonna have another term and in, in early next year if this is continuing to that point, I think he’s the one that has the strength to go in and negotiate a peace in this. But not if Russia rolls through the country, I mean, this is really important. As I said in a, in a press gaggle here the other day, to be blunt, I would rather send bullets to Ukraine than boys. You know American soldiers, we don’t want boots on the ground. We’re not the world’s policemen. If we can invest this small amount right now and achieve the desired outcome that is better for us in the long run, and it saves us a lot of money and of course, blood and toil.     ###

April 22,Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan,D,Northern Marianas Islands,Marianas at National STEM Fest,"April 19, 2024 For Immediate Release Contact: Taylor Haulsee   What They’re Saying: Conservatives, Faith Leaders, Advocacy Organizations Support House National Security Supplemental Legislation    WASHINGTON — On Wednesday, Speaker Johnson announced the House response to the Senate’s national security supplemental legislation. This legislation is comprised of four separate bills and provides resources to Israel, Ukraine, and the Indo-Pacific, as well as measures to counter adversaries in each region.   “This legislation also includes enhanced oversight and accountability of U.S. taxpayer resources and includes upgrades to the Senate bill like the REPO Act and transferring portions of Ukraine aid into a loan. What we’ve done is taken the Senate supplemental bill, and we’ve improved the process and the policy, and that’s a really important thing,” Speaker Johnson said.   Conservatives, faith leaders, advocacy organizations strongly support the legislation:   “AIPAC strongly supports Speaker Johnson’s work to bring important national security bills to the floor, and we urge every House member to vote for crucial security aid to our ally Israel,” —  AIPAC.   “The Israel Supplemental Appropriations Act provides critical support to a key ally facing our common enemy, Iran. This is especially true now that Iran has attacked Israel directly, not just through proxies. We call upon all Members of Congress to support the rule & the bill,” — Coalition for Jewish Values.   “We urge all members to support the rule allowing the foreign aid bill to come to the floor so we can deliver critical emergency military assistance to Israel. Don’t tell us you stand with Israel, show us,” — Christians United for Israel.   “In the aftermath of the October 7th Hamas massacre and Iran’s direct attack against Israel’s homeland, these votes are an especially critical test of support for the US-Israel alliance. The time to act is now,” — Republican Jewish Coalition.   “We welcome the release of the House of Representatives’ security supplemental package, which includes a number of vital measures that AJC has long advocated for, such as security assistance to our allies Israel and Ukraine, and funding for the Nonprofit Security Grant Program to keep Jewish communities in the U.S. safe. We urge its swift passage,” — American Jewish Committee.   “It is absolutely critical that Christians in America and around the world stand with Israel, protect Israel’s right to defend itself, and work to contain this conflict so that it doesn’t threaten global peace. We stand with Israel,” — Family Research Council.   “The leadership of Speaker Mike Johnson has been crucial in defending life, religious freedom, fiscal responsibility, and important allies like Israel. He always stands strong and we’re proud to stand with him,” — Center for Urban Renewal.   “As former Secretary of State and former Vice Chief of Staff of the Army we write at a pivotal moment in our nation’s history to applaud your efforts to secure vital support to America’s allies and to strengthen America’s defenses,” — Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo & Vice Chief of Staff to the Army Jack Keane.   “Speaker Mike Johnson is a man of incredible character, who has unequivocally shown his support of protecting the unborn, the family, and standing strong with one of our greatest allies, Israel. In light of Iran’s unprecedented attack against Israel last week, we must ensure that every Republican is supportive of the Speaker’s efforts to bring Israel funding to the finish line as quickly as possible. CWALAC supports Speaker Johnson and his efforts to support Israel,” — Concerned Women for America LAC.   “Last week, the ERLC sent a letter to Speaker Johnson & all members of Congress urging them to pass critical support for Ukraine. While there are some political headwinds, I’m grateful Mike Johnson is moving forward to help Ukraine defend itself against Putin’s illegal invasion,” — Brent Leatherwood, Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission President.    “This supplemental package includes bills that the CCP, Russia, and the Islamic Republic of Iran all vehemently oppose, it will be devastating to our enemies if this passes,” — POLARIS.   “A resilient U.S. DIB and a strong network of U.S. allies and partners form the foundation of U.S. national deterrence in a rapidly evolving strategic environment. On behalf of NDIA’s members, I commend the House leadership for supporting these necessary investments and urge swift passage,” — David Norquist, National Defense Industry Association President.   “The bill to force China to divest from TikTok may soon be on the President’s desk. Thank you Speaker Johnson for your leadership,” — Foundation for American Innovation.   “FDD Action endorses the supplemental funding package put forward today by Speaker Mike Johnson. We urge members of Congress on both sides of the aisle to support it along with the underlying rule. America’s adversaries are watching. The authoritarian axis of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Russia, and the Chinese Communist Party are challenging U.S. interests like never before. It is imperative that both chambers of the Congress act with urgency to provide critical support to Israel, Taiwan, and Ukraine. These nations are on the front lines of a generation-defining fight for freedom and prosperity, and their success is inextricably linked to our own national security. This legislation paves the way for targeted investments with strong oversight in our allies and partners that will enhance their military capabilities, deter America’s adversaries, and contain the spread of even costlier conflicts,” — Foundation for Defense of Democracies Action.   “In supporting U.S. assistance to Ukraine, Israel, and allies in the Indo-Pacific, Speaker Johnson channels President Ronald Reagan. Speaking to Congress in 1985, President Reagan declared, ‘We must stand by all our democratic allies. And we must not break faith with those who are risking their lives,’” — Ronald Reagan Institute.   “We should all call our congressmen and urge them to pass aid to stop Putin, to help Israel, to strengthen Taiwan and to close the border. I am especially glad that the REPO act has been included to use Russian money to pay for defeating Putin,” — Former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich.   “America is the leader of the free world and I would call on all my old friends in the Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, to rally around Speaker Johnson as he brings legislation to the floor to do America’s part to renew our support for Ukraine, for Israel, for Taiwan, and for freedom in the world,” — Former Vice President Mike Pence.   ###

April 22,Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan,D,Northern Marianas Islands,"Federal aid for farmers, ranchers","April 19, 2024 For Immediate Release Contact: Taylor Haulsee   Speaker delivers remarks following House vote on rule   WASHINGTON — Following a 316-94 vote on the procedural rule to allow amendments and debate on the House national security supplemental, Speaker Johnson delivered brief remarks to press off the House floor:   “The Senate sent us effectively a blank check for foreign aid, and that was not going to work for the policy or the process in the House. It is a better process to break the bills up into four separate measures for consideration and that is what we will have tomorrow. Everyone can vote their will and their constituents desires on Israel aid, the Ukrainian aid, the Indo-Pacific, and our fourth national security package that has all of the innovations in it.   “Because we did this process, we got a better outcome. There are a lot of innovations that the Senate didn’t consider. We include the REPO Act, which as you know is the use of corrupt Russian oligarchs’ assets to help fund the resistance in Ukraine. We introduced the loan concept for the governmental assistance part to be provided a loan, instead of a gift. We also included some really important sanctions on Russia and China and Iran, which I believe is the new axis of evil, and many of us do. They are the ones who are the aggressors in this situation.   “The reality here is that if the House did not do this better policy and process, allowing for amendments on the floor in the process tomorrow, we would have had to eat the Senate supplemental bill. And that is because we were very close, given the timeline of both Israel and Ukraine, to a discharge petition being brought. And a discharge petition, in layman’s terms, is when a number of members or a majority of members get together, they can override the Speaker and bring something straight to the floor. That would have happened imminently on the Senate supplemental.   “So, by doing this, even though it’s not the perfect legislation, it’s not the legislation that we would write if Republicans were in charge of both the House, the Senate, and the White House, this is the best possible product that we can get under these circumstances to take care of these really important obligations. And so, we look forward to the vote tomorrow. We look forward to every member voting their conscience and their desire. And that is exactly how this process is supposed to work and how the House is supposed to operate. We’re happy to provide that and we’ll give you more comment tomorrow.”   ###

April 22,Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan,D,Northern Marianas Islands,"Congratulations, Judge Manglona","April 20, 2024 For Immediate Release Contact: Taylor Haulsee   “We gave our members a voice. We gave them a better process and ultimately a much better policy.”   WASHINGTON — Today, following House passage of the national security supplemental, Speaker Johnson delivered remarks to press off the House floor.   Watch Speaker Johnson’s full remarks here   Read below for the full transcript of Speaker Johnson’s remarks:   The House has worked its will. These are not normal times here in the House or around the world as we all know, and we saw the disturbance here on the House floor just a bit ago. I just want to say simply what I think most people around the country understand and agree, we should only wave one flag on the House floor. And I think we know which flag that is.   I said these are not normal times, they’re not, the world is destabilized and it’s a tinderbox. It’s a dangerous time. Three of our primary adversaries, Russia, Iran, and China are working together, and they’re being aggressors around the globe. And they’re a global threat to our prosperity and our security. Their advance threatens the free world, and it demands American leadership. If we turn our backs right now the consequences could be devastating.   So, this afternoon, the House acted and we sent over to the Senate – it will be transmitted shortly – our supplemental national security legislation and make no mistake, this is not a blank check like the Senate supplemental bill was. This is very different. Instead of taking the path of least resistance and bringing up the Senate supplemental on the House floor, or just allowing a discharge petition to come forward – which would have had the same outcome – we gave our members a voice. We gave them a chance. We gave them a better process, and ultimately a much better policy.   Unlike the Senate’s blank check, the House legislation has a number of very important features. It provides for greater accountability over Ukraine aid.  It forces an end-game strategy for the Ukraine war. It includes a loan instrument of this foreign aid to Ukraine and the REPO act to ensure that Russian assets pay for part of the bill. And unlike the Senate’s bill, the loan system itself is a House innovation, and allows for much needed insight. And remember that 80% of the Ukraine funding will go to the replenishment of American weapons and stocks and our facilities and our operations.   It also includes tough measures and sanctions on Iran and Russia and China, which most of the American people understand is a necessity and a very important thing. Our process in the end ensured that each member was able to consider the individual supplemental elements on their own merits, which is exactly how the House is supposed to work.   I know there are critics of the legislation, I understand that it is not a perfect piece of legislation. We’re not insured that in a time of divided government and at a time where there are lots of different opinions, but there is no question whatsoever that the House has made many strong improvements to the Senate bill. And the product that we’ve sent over there is much better. This package, I will note because it’s very important, also includes national security priorities and many of them, but it is the only way that we could have gotten Democrats to support aid to Israel. And that’s a fact.   There is a lot of misinformation out there about the bill. And I just want to make one point about one issue that has drawn a lot of attention and that is could any of this funding go to Hamas or to terrorist organizations or what have you. And we put safeguards in the legislation to ensure that UNRWA is not funded, the UN agency that included terrorists who participated in the October 7th attack on Israel. We’ve also had language that prevents it from going in either funding going to Hamas, or any other bad actors. That’s a very important element of oversight. Congress takes the oversight very seriously. And we will continue to keep an eye on every dollar that we’re using and investing at this time.   I’ve said it very simply. I’ll say it once again. It’s an old military adage, but we would rather send bullets to the conflict overseas than our own boys, our troops. And I think this is an important moment and important opportunity to make that decision. We allowed the House to do that. And I expect the Senate will make the same decision.   Background:   ###

April 22,Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan,D,Northern Marianas Islands,"THIS WEEK IN CONGRESS - April 19, 2024","April 20, 2024 For Immediate Release Contact: Taylor Haulsee   WASHINGTON — Read the RealClearPolitics profile of Speaker Mike Johnson, “A Beleaguered Gentleman: Speaker Mike Johnson,” out today at RealClearPolitics.com.   “You assume risk when you take this job. We don’t back away from risk. I’m going to do the right thing,” Johnson says as storm clouds – literal ones, not just the political variety – roll in… After all, the speaker continues, “what is popular isn’t always right; what’s right isn’t always popular.”   A Beleaguered Gentleman: Speaker Mike Johnson RealClearPolitics Philip Wegmann April 20, 2024   The sky is cloudless and blue on a warm April afternoon as a cheerful Mike Johnson, seated on a beige couch next to an unlit fireplace in an office still new to him, contemplates his demise, taking solace in Providence and repeating the words of John Quincy Adams – an illustration of his circumstances almost as much as a reluctant acceptance of fate:   “Duty is ours. Results are God’s.”   The future of the 56th speaker of the House of Representatives also belongs to the Almighty, if not a small cadre of his fellow Republicans. Johnson admits as much in an interview with RealClearPolitics on Monday when asked if he’s prepared to risk his speakership over sending war aid to Ukraine.   Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has warned that his country will lose to Russia unless the United States approves more military aid. Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, meanwhile, has promised the speaker that he will lose his job if Congress does exactly that.   “You assume risk when you take this job. We don’t back away from risk. I’m going to do the right thing,” Johnson says as storm clouds – literal ones, not just the political variety – roll in. Financing a land war wasn’t “some minor measure on tax policy,” he adds. It instead has “implications for the entire world.” Afterall, the speaker continues, “what is popular isn’t always right; what’s right isn’t always popular.”   Johnson pauses at that, smiling sheepishly at the “bumper sticker slogan” he’s uttered. Thunder and rain follow the interview, and the storm now follows the speaker as he struggles to survive. He has a possible coup on his hands, and the party leader whom barely anyone really knows could soon be toppled.   The Louisiana Republican’s path to the speakership was the product of chaos after Kevin McCarthy was ousted last October through a motion to vacate, a parliamentary rule that allows a single member to force a vote to remove the speaker. After a unanimous Democratic Party House conference joined forces with eight conservative GOP renegades, McCarthy was out and the ad hoc effort to find his replacement began. More seasoned Republicans volunteered for the job. Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana. Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan of Ohio. Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota. All fell short, one by one.   The fourth nominee was different. “We were finally just so sick of it,” recalls Texas Rep. Michael McCaul, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, “that we all threw our hands up, and said we don’t have anything against this guy. Let’s just go with him.” Three weeks of infighting ended when the conservative and centrist wings of the GOP made peace. Congress elected Johnson, the vice chair of the GOP caucus, the lowest man on the leadership totem pole, by a party-line vote of  220-209. “I never aspired to it,” he says of the position. His family hadn’t planned on it either. Johnson’s wife, Kelly, couldn’t catch a flight to D.C. in time to see her husband sworn in.   The New York Times described him as “conservative hard-liner beloved by the far right” who was little-known other than his record as a lawyer and legislator, punctuated by gently articulated opposition to abortion, homosexuality, and gay marriage. His election, the paper reported in a breaking news bulletin, “further cemented the Republican Party’s lurch to the right.”   Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters he had never met Johnson. White House aides scrambled to Google the man just elected second-in-line to the presidency. The conservatives who knew of him were ecstatic.   Johnson introduced himself by telling Congress that they had cast the votes, but the decision had come from above. Leaning on Scripture, the new speaker said in his acceptance speech “that God has ordained and allowed each one of us to be brought here for this specific moment in time.” The House assented with polite, if not occasionally bemused, applause. “It’s not like his value set is hidden,” says Tony Perkins, the president of the conservative Family Research Council, who hired Johnson out of law school as an aide in the Louisiana  legislature. “You don’t need a decoder ring. Want to know his positions? Read the Bible.”   And Johnson does look, and he often sounds, like a Sunday school teacher. In dozens of interviews with colleagues, friends, and contemporaries, none could recall the bookish lawyer ever raising his voice in anger. “He has the decorum of a Southern gentleman in the DNA,” insists Rep. Clay Higgins, a Louisiana Republican and Freedom Caucus member who calls the speaker “my brother.” He is also a creature of the right, best known before politics as a litigator who filed an amicus brief to the Supreme Court in defense of “traditional marriage” on behalf of the conservative analogue of the ACLU, a group called Alliance Defending Freedom.   “I don’t know how Rayburn felt about IVF,” jokes South Dakota Rep. Dusty Johnson, who chairs the Main Street Caucus, a group of more moderate Republicans in Congress, “but I think it’s safe to say that Mike Johnson is the most conservative speaker in modern political history.”   A Leadership Newcomer   He can offer more than devotions and hallway homilies, however. A constitutional law attorney, Johnson ingrained himself in the Republican Study Committee when he came to Congress in 2017 and was later elected chairman of the group that churns out white papers as the GOP’s in-house conservative think tank. “He possesses tremendous intellectual firepower,” says Alabama Rep. Gary Palmer, the fifth ranking Republican in the House. Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana describes Johnson in a way the speaker himself never would: “He pisses excellence.”   But an impressive resume is no guarantee of success. Johnson had little leadership experience, other than scheduling the one-minute floor speeches members make in the morning to an empty House chamber. He certainly hadn’t negotiated anything of consequence. On his first full day in the job, the rookie speaker sat across the table in the White House Situation Room with President Biden, a man who first ran for the U.S. Senate the year Johnson was born. They’d never previously met.   “That’s a pretty tall order, especially when you’re brand new as a speaker,” recalls McCaul, who accompanied Johnson to negotiations at the White House three months later. The speaker, still green but growing, held forth to demand Biden defend not just Ukrainian territory but America’s own border. “It was almost like the newly elected junior speaker was growing into the position by educating the president,” McCaul says of Johnson’s lecture to Biden about executive actions that could be taken, sans Congress, to slow the surge of illegal crossings.   “We understand that there’s concern about the safety, security and sovereignty of Ukraine,” Johnson told reporters after the meeting wrapped, “but the American people have those same concerns about our own domestic sovereignty and our safety and our security.”   The lesson did not stick. Biden has not taken executive action on the border. Congress has not approved more aid Ukraine either. Conservative hopes of forcing Democrats to swallow beefed up border security in exchange for more war funding dimmed and now seem out of reach.   “Mike Johnson has constantly been calling me ‘a friend,’” Greene complains. “I don’t even know Mike Johnson!” She has haunted the speaker for months, promising to topple him with the same motion to vacate that ended McCarthy’s tenure if Johnson moves more Ukraine aid. “He’s not a friend of mine.” MTG, as Greene is often referred to, details during an interview with RealClearPolitics the alleged sins of the speaker against MAGA. They are many.   MTG isn’t just angry about efforts to underwrite the land war in Europe. She is furious about the spending bills that Johnson helped muscle through with Democratic support to avoid a government shutdown, legislative behemoths that ballooned the deficit, and worst of all in her mind, funded the Department of Justice that’s bringing charges against the former president.   “Johnson funded that,” she fumes. “They want to kill Trump,” she said of the myriad of indictments brought by the DOJ. “They want him to die in jail!”   “MAGA, Christian, conservative,” Greene continues, rattling off the resume Johnson presented to the conference. “He has completely betrayed all three of those identities.”   Johnson is barely six months into the job. His colleagues report that the Southern Baptist doesn’t drink, smoke, or cuss. But hardliners like Greene complain that he doesn’t fight either.   “Well,” Johnson replies, back in his office, “that’s just not accurate.” With Trump’s blessing, he helped smother a bipartisan border deal deemed insufficiently conservative. The House also impeached Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas over his handling of the border. But on spending, the past isn’t dead, he says in so many words. It isn’t even past, as Faulkner might add. Instead, Johnson says he was bequeathed a cursed dowry from McCarthy.   “I inherited a budget deal made by my predecessor that was unchangeable,” he explains. With one half of one third of government barely under his control, the speaker reports running into a brick wall while negotiating with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jefferies and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Republican minority leader, wasn’t any help either.   “I was reminded very quickly by the other three of the four corners that ‘No, the deal was made,’” Johnson says in recapping weeks of negotiations.   “It doesn’t apply to me,” he shot back.   “‘Oh, yes, it does. It’s the House’s deal,’” they replied. “So, we did the best we could within that to fight for our policy priorities,” Johnson sighs, “and we got many of them.” But his right flank isn’t satisfied by wins on the margin, despite one of the slimmest majority margins in U.S history.   Walking a Narrow Path   Enter coalition government, where the byword is compromise, a liability for Johnson when conservatives consider bipartisanship a bitter poison.   The speaker holds the majority, yes, but only by a margin of 218 to 213. More than a quarter of his caucus, 55 Republicans, a recent Wall Street Journal analysis found, consistently vote against major government spending bills. To get around his right flank’s objections, and to keep the government from shutting down, Johnson has resorted to a maneuver called suspension of the rules, which requires a two-thirds supermajority of votes. A majority of Democrats, not Republicans, have supplied needed votes. Of course, Johnson could have thrown a Hail Mary. He could have threatened a shutdown to try and force the White House and Senate to his will.   “The people who are the most frustrated about the spending process wanted us to shut the government down,” Johnson explains. “They fail to acknowledge the reality that a government shutdown would not behoove the country or our chances to prevail in November.” If he had cast his lot with the hardliners and the government went dark, Johnson insists, it would have “backfired” and given “the White House all the cards.”   This pains the speaker. He sees himself as a conservative, and not so long ago he regularly broke bread with the Freedom Caucus. “They are some of my best friends,” he said years ago when running for RSC chairman, describing “the tremendous amount of respect” he had for how those hardliners thwarted then-Speaker Paul Ryan’s plans to pass a watered-down version of Obamacare repeal. He was right there with them trying to jam the speaker. He hated the parliamentary tricks leadership played, especially the thousand-page bills dropped overnight on the rank-and-file. “I didn’t sign up to do legislation that way,” Johnson complained. He was an insurgent – though a polite one.   Barely finished with his freshman year, Johnson was accustomed to “the arm-wrestling routine.” In the newsroom of the conservative Washington Examiner, the lawmaker nobody knew praised a robust back-and-forth. “We never compromise our core principles,” he said then of how conservatives ought to legislate, “but you have to compromise your preferences sometimes.” Almost as an afterthought, he added, “otherwise, the system breaks down.”   It was the summer of 2018. With unified government, Republicans could afford to squabble a bit,  up until the point they lost the House and then the White House and Senate. One thing Johnson vowed never to change: a promise to his family. “When I go home,” he explained, “I want to look my kids in the eye and tell them that daddy acted like a gentleman.”   This past March, Johnson felt he owed Biden an apology. Seated just over the president’s shoulder during the State of the Union address, the speaker couldn’t mask his expressions of exhaustion and exasperation as Biden laid into Republicans. The two next met on Capitol Hill for the Friends of Ireland luncheon where Johnson toasted Biden as “America’s most famous Irishman.” On loan from the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, his pint glass was the same one Reagan used during a 1984 visit to Ireland. The Guinness the Southern Baptist speaker drank was non-alcoholic.   Johnson pulled Biden aside to “apologize for the eye-roll memes that went around the world.” The president laughed, then told the speaker he was glad Johnson was better behaved than Nancy Pelosi had been during the speeches of his predecessor: “I’m just grateful you didn’t rip my speech up.” The speaker replied, “Well, Mr. President, don’t think my friends back home didn’t want me to light it on fire.”   It may have been a missed opportunity. A little arson might have endeared him to the bomb throwers in his caucus. Former Speaker Newt Gingrich recently commiserated that the current speaker was leading “the most complicated House since the Civil War,” a sentiment Johnson doesn’t dispute. “It is an extraordinary time of challenge,” he says as members of his own party plot against him.   “We’re going through a valley right now,” Johnson insists, “but I’m very bullish on the November election cycle, and I believe we’re going to be in a much better place on the other side of this.” He himself may not make it. The life spans of Republican speakers are shrinking. Predecessors John Boehner, Ryan, and McCarthy were run out of town due to rebellions, exhaustion, or a mix of both.   Democrats don’t seem to have the same problem, a fact not lost on Johnson. On the other side of the aisle, he sees a party that “thinks like a union, they really do. They think as collectivists, as a body, and it’s easier to move them as social animals.” The Party of Lincoln, on the other hand, is made up of “rugged individualists by nature. We are deeply principled, and we just don’t yield as easily.” This is “a great blessing” Johnson says, “but it’s also a great challenge when you have a single-vote margin in a legislative body where you need everybody to work and move in the same direction.” When combined with a 24-hour news cycle and compounded by social media, he continues, “there are challenges right now that no previous speaker has had to contend with.”   Greene filed her motion to vacate with the House clerk right before Congress left for Easter recess. She chose not to privilege the resolution, which would have triggered an immediate floor vote, referring to the motion instead as “more of a warning than a pink slip.” What has followed, according to one senior GOP aide, is an exercise in “Nixon-era Mad Men theory.” The question is not if, but when, a challenge will come.   “If we vacate the chair a second time, there is no one who could successfully lead this conference. No one. That person does not exist, not only in the House. They don’t exist in this country,” Dusty Johnson, the moderate Republican, groaned. He added, “If we are so broken that we are going to perform this Greek tragedy a second time, then what a clown show.”   “I consider Marjorie Taylor Greene to be my friend. She’s still my friend,” Higgins said in a video cut straight to social media shortly after the motion to vacate was filed, “but she just made a big mistake.” A member of the Freedom Caucus, Higgins split with GOP brass on both spending packages and opposes more funding for Ukraine. He still backs the speaker, however. “Brotherhood is the respect that you extend to your brother to fight his fight,” Higgins says of the withering criticism Johnson now faces. “He’s never been attacked the way that he is suffering now that he’s the speaker, which is almost an impossible job in the best of circumstances.”   “People get pissed off up here, brother, and they say shit they don’t mean,” Higgins says of Greene’s assertion that the speaker betrayed his Christian identity. “Character,” he added, “really emerges when you do not smash somebody who has given you cause to smash them.”   Johnson has not retaliated against members of his party for defying his leadership, and there was a feeling that Greene’s revolt might be a mutiny of one. Then Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican and perennial thorn in the side of each speaker he has served with, co-sponsored the motion to vacate and called on Johnson to resign. Asked what the final straw was, foreign aid or a recent bill renewing FISA, Massie responded on Twitter “all of the above.” The libertarian added, “This camel has a pallet of bricks.”   ‘Code of Faith’   His sudden elevation brought with it an evolution for Johnson. As a member of the Judiciary Committee, he once railed against what he saw as abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Then Johnson walked into a sensitive compartmented information facility.   “We got so spun up and so frustrated by it, at one point, we thought about getting rid of the statute,” he recalls of his initial frustrations with FISA as a rank-and-file member. “And then I went to the skiff,” says the man now second in line to the presidency, “and heard classified briefings and how critically important it is to national security.” It was conversations with the likes of former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former House Intel Chair Devin Nunes that changed his mind. “They said, ‘We’ve gotta have it; this is why we haven’t had another 9/11 on our shores.’” With their counsel, Johnson explains, “I became a champion of that. I don’t want innocent Americans to die.”   And prior to picking up the gavel, Johnson never supported aid for Ukraine either.   “I really do believe the intel and in the briefings that we’ve gotten,” Johnson told reporters ahead of the vote on a foreign assistance plan now seemingly tied to his own fate. “I believe Xi and Vladimir Putin and Iran really are an axis of evil,” he said, warning that Moscow could potentially move further into Europe if not stopped in Ukraine. “To put it bluntly, I would rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys.”   After a bruising fight with his own party to renew FISA, but before bringing Ukraine funding to the floor for a vote, the speaker decamped for Mar-a-Lago. The meeting with former President Donald Trump had been on the books for weeks, he says. Unlike the rest of Washington, Trump already knows Johnson well.   Like most Republicans, Johnson has a favorite Trump story. Before becoming speaker, he did a pretty decent Trump impression. They first spoke when the congressman was himself jamming GOP leadership, refusing to vote for an Obamacare repeal package that didn’t go far enough in his estimation. The call came one morning as Johnson was finishing his devotions in his office (where he lived). The president wanted him to vote yes on the bill. The congressman stubbornly explained why he had to vote no.   His Bible was open to the Book of Daniel at the time, Johnson was once fond of telling friends, specifically the passage where Daniel interprets the dreams of Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar. And the congressman felt compelled to tell Trump that, once their call ended, he would pray for the president. The line went quiet. Trump broke the silence: “Tell God, I say hi.”   Johnson still lives in his office when he’s in Washington, although he has since dropped the impression. And either incidentally or by design, the former president offered the speaker a lifeline. “He’s doing a really good job under very tough circumstances, and I appreciate that he came to Mar-a-Lago,” Trump said of Johnson at a press conference. But what about his most faithful disciple in Congress? Trump reiterated that Johnson was doing “about as good as you’re going to do,” adding that “I’m sure Marjorie understands that.”   For the speaker, the press conference couldn’t have gone any better. “We delivered the message we needed to deliver,” he says. The trip was important, he adds, because it demonstrated “a unified front for our party,” showing “that our soon-to-be nominee for president and the House leadership here, and the speaker, are 100% in line on our agenda.”   Trump and Johnson – whom the former president once dubbed “MAGA Mike” – couldn’t be more different in temperament. Trump, for instance, once remarked that his greatest contribution to the GOP might just be that he taught Republicans to fight. Johnson, for his part, likely wishes they’d stop fighting one another.   In March, at the sprawling Greenbriar Resort in the mountains of West Virginia, Emmer sought a pragmatic peace. “We don’t have to like each other; we have to respect one another,” he told Republicans gathered for the GOP policy retreat.   “I have to differ with the whip,” Johnson told the conference, “the Bible teaches us to love one another even if we don’t like each other.”   “I can’t imagine John Boehner saying something like that without everyone laughing,” McCaul said of the former speaker famous for smoking Camels and swirling Merlot while in Congress and later lobbying for weed industry once out of it. “But everyone knows Mike is sincere.”   It wasn’t his first sermon. At another retreat, this one in Miami the month before, an exasperated GOP member anonymously griped to Politico about the speaker’s scriptural references: “I’m not at church.” The press was far less charitable. There isn’t much dirt on Johnson. But there was plenty of gawking at the strange Southern gentleman who makes no secret of his faith.   Slate asserted that his covenant marriage, an arrangement not uncommon among evangelicals that sets a higher bar for divorce, reflected a “radical marital strategy.” The New Republic mistook a passing remark about prayer during his acceptance speech as “a gross gaffe.” Rolling Stone implied that Johnson and his son’s use of software to filter out explicit material online was somehow meant to do the opposite.   The speaker isn’t angry at such clueless coverage. He is just disappointed. What he is espousing in his personal life, without mandating it for anyone else, Johnson believes, isn’t all that different than what was normal in previous generations, or just a few decades ago. Namely, the expectation that lawmakers have “a moral center,” he says, adding, “Washington doesn’t know what to do with a person who actually lives by a code of faith and doesn’t just talk about it.”   But the more extreme MAGA apologists see things differently. “If we’re gonna be biblical,” Greene says in her office, “we can say we’re supposed to judge them by the fruit they bear, right?” The congresswoman, who recently pointed to an earthquake and the solar eclipse as signs of coming divine judgement, is no less religious in her own way. “God isn’t afraid of battle or conflict,” she notes, citing the story of Jesus driving the money changers out of the temple. “Anger,” she concludes, “can be righteous.”   A Way Forward?   But anger doesn’t counter arithmetic erosion. The GOP majority has been evaporating as members retire early rather than serve out their full terms, and Johnson can now only lose one vote on legislation. The defining story of his speakership, explains Dusty Johnson, is just “what a lousy hand of cards he was dealt.”   “If this was a movie,” the South Dakota congressman says, there would be a moment where the speaker would walk onto the House floor and deliver a speech so perfect that “through sheer force of oratory, he would bend the will of the United States government. That is not the way real progress happens in democratic republic.”   A final tragedy or early triumph for Johnson may be imminent. His far right wing is in open rebellion over a foreign aid package that does not include border security reforms. Challengers are reportedly lining up support to replace him. Leadership elections, and the chaos that follows, loom. Would he remove the sword that dangles above his head?   “Having a single motion, I don’t think anyone in the building believes that’s a good idea because it creates a real hindrance to the process itself,” Johnson says in his office this past Monday. It shouldn’t be just erased in the next Congress, he continues: “There should be a motion, but the threshold should be higher. And I think 99% of the people here probably agree.”   Another avenue of temporary salvation exists. An ironic one. Some on the left have vowed publicly that they would ride to the rescue of the most socially conservative speaker in recent memory. Does he have any faith in those promises?   “I have lots of friends in the building,” the speaker says, and “I’ve had a handful of Democrats approach me on the floor and say, ‘Hey, don’t worry about the motion to vacate.’” He doesn’t entertain those conversations, Johnson insists.   The speaker was swept into office in an instant, and he could leave just as quickly. There was hope that Johnson could lead Republicans out of the wilderness, that he could hold together a fractured caucus long enough not just to maintain but grow the GOP majority. He still might. The speaker came into leadership trusting in Providence, and he now trusts his fate to the same.   “We are actually called to bless even those who persecute us and return good for evil,” he says, citing biblical admonishment when asked about the attacks on his character. “And I get a lot of practice in all of that every day now, more than I aspire to.”   “I don’t hold grudges,” he says. “I easily forgive, and that’s required a lot these days.” This, the speaker says as his fate remains uncertain, “is a liberating way to live.”   ###

April 22,Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan,D,Northern Marianas Islands,"Congratulations, Judge Manglona","April 22, 2024 Critical Funds Will Aid BECMA’s Efforts to Support Small Black-Owned Business and Black Entrepreneurs Photos (Dropbox) | Video (YouTube) BOSTON – Today, Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) and Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) visited Nubian Square in Roxbury for a roundtable discussion to celebrate the $1,000,000 million in federal funding they secured for the Black Economic Council of Massachusetts (BECMA). The funding will help BECMA’s efforts to support small Black-owned businesses and Black entrepreneurs through technical assistance and other tools and services. “For generations, Black families have been systematically denied the opportunity to build wealth, and this precise, intentional federal investment in our Black small business owners and entrepreneurs will help us close the glaring racial wealth gap right here in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts” said Rep. Pressley. “As representative for one of the most unequal districts in this country, I am proud to have secured this robust funding alongside my colleague Senator Warren to help our communities thrive.” “BECMA’s work to help address the Black wealth gap in the Commonwealth is powerfully important, and this federal funding that Rep. Ayanna Pressley, Senator Markey and I helped secure is one of the best ways we can continue to support BECMA’s crucial mission of supporting Black-owned businesses,” said Sen. Warren. “I was delighted to celebrate this funding today and I’m going to keep fighting for federal investments and efforts to help close the Black wealth gap.” Congresswoman Pressley and Senator Warren were joined at the roundtable by BECMA President Nicole Obi and Black small business owners supported by BECMA’s Back Office Support Services (BOSS) program. “The Black Economic Council of Massachusetts is thankful for Congresswoman Pressley and Senator Warren’s leadership in securing BECMA $1 million in federal funding to help us continue our work to build and sustain Black wealth across the Commonwealth,” said Nicole Obi, President and CEO at the Black Economic Council of Massachusetts. “This critical funding supports BECMA’s Back Office Support Services (BOSS) program, which provides our members with access to working capital grants, digital tools, and professional services to help them launch and scale their firms.” “We are so grateful to Congresswoman Pressley and Senator Warren for prioritizing support for small, diverse businesses like ours,” said Denise O’Marde, Owner of Cafe Juice Up in Mattapan. “We are also deeply appreciative to our BECMA family for providing us access to the critical resources and services that help us stabilize our operations and thrive.” “Thank you to Congresswoman Pressley and Senator Warren for advocating for organizations like BECMA that support Black-owned businesses,” said Shana Bryant, Founder and CEO of Shana Bryant Consulting. “BECMA has provided invaluable support to my firm that expanded our HR infrastructure and capacity, including a $10,000 BOSS grant that helped to cover the interest for a financing loan.” “Thank you to BECMA for providing support for my business at a critical time and to Rep. Pressley and Senator Warren for their leadership,” said Abdllahi “Mash” Abdirahman, Founder and Owner of Butterfly Falafel. “I encourage them to continue to prioritize diversity, equity, and inclusion in their work and to ensure that federal funding reaches Black businesses and communities directly.” Footage from the roundtable and press conference can be found here, and photos are here. Rep. Pressley secured the federal funding for the program in the Fiscal Year 2023 government spending package that passed Congress and was signed into law by President Biden in December 2022. Rep. Pressley has secured approximately $35 million in federal community project funding for the Massachusetts 7th since Fiscal Year 2022. ### Washington DC Office 402 Cannon HOB

April 22,Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan,D,Northern Marianas Islands,Marianas at National STEM Fest,"Subscribe to receive the latest news, insights, and updates directly to your inbox. TAMPA, FL — Today, U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor (FL-14) announced $156.1 million in federal grant funding from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for the Florida Solar for All Coalition to accelerate the deployment of solar energy statewide, including in historically underserved communities. The grant funding was authorized through the Inflation Reduction Act’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. “Cleaner, cheaper solar energy is key to lowering electricity bills, increasing energy reliability, and reducing pollution that is driving the costs of the climate crisis,” said Rep. Castor. “These significant investments will help more Florida families take advantage of the cost-savings of solar and create good-paying jobs. It’s past time we harness the power of the sun in the Sunshine State, and I am thrilled that experienced nonprofit champions Solar United Neighbors, the Solar Energy Loan Fund and The Nature Conservancy of Florida will help lead the way.” The EPA announced 60 selectees that will receive $7 billion in grant awards through the Solar for All grant competition to deliver residential solar projects to over 900,000 households nationwide. The funding intends to develop long-lasting solar initiatives that enable low-income and disadvantaged communities to deploy and benefit from distributed residential solar. Read EPA’s full announcement here. Castor has been a leader in advancing investments in clean, renewable solar power in the Sunshine State. As chair of the former Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, Castor recommended that the Congress create the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, including solar initiatives, to jumpstart investments in clean energy."
April 22,Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan,D,Northern Marianas Islands,Technical Assistance grants awarded,"Today, Congressman Henry Cuellar, Ph.D. (TX-28) announced $3,120,000 in federal funds for schoolyard forestry in Laredo. The funds, awarded by the Texas A&M Forestry Service, were made possible by the Inflation Reduction Act, which Dr. Cuellar helped pass in 2022. “Quality campus amenities encourage a positive learning environment for our students. The funds announced today for the Adelante con Arboles project will deliver a unique urban forestry solution for Laredo students as they learn more about the natural wonders of our world,” said Dr. Cuellar. “I applaud the Texas A&M Forest Service for utilizing federal dollars made available through the Inflation Reduction Act to invest in South Texas. Thank you to Dr. Sylvia Guerra Rios, Superintendent of LISD, and Tricia Cortez, Executive Director of RGISC, for working with me to secure these funds for Laredo students.” “Beyond beautifying our schools, these trees will play an important role in making our campuses feel more welcoming and attractive,” stated LISD Superintendent of Schools Dr. Sylvia G. Rios. “Our students will watch these trees grow and connect them to their fond memories of their educational experience at LISD.” “More importantly, these trees will also serve as useful tools to teach our students about the world around them and the importance as well as responsibility we all share in nurturing our environment,” Dr. Rios exclaimed. “We are so grateful to be the recipients of such a generous grant, and as such, we are committed to working alongside our community partners to positively impact the world in which we live,” reiterated Dr. Rios. “This is a special day for such an announcement; not only is it taking place on Earth Day, but it represents a new step forward for our South Texas border city. This Laredo project was one of only five selected from across Texas, and it speaks to the commitment of our community to increase native tree canopy at Laredo ISD, provide outdoor learning opportunities for students, and begin to address climate change and severe urban heat island in the inner city,” said Tricia Cortez, Executive Director of RGISC. This award will help the Laredo Independent School District (LISD) and Rio Grande International Study Center (RGISC) implement their Adelante con Arboles project to plant trees and increase tree canopy coverage by 30% across eight Laredo schools: The project will provide students with greater opportunities for outdoor education, raise environmental awareness, create special outdoor areas for children with autism, and address the shortage of certified arborists in Laredo. This year, the Texas A&M Forestry Service announced a historic $15.4 million in grant funding through its Forestry Grant Program. The goal of the program is to build healthier urban and community forests throughout the state which are essential for the economic, environmental, physical and mental well-being of all Texans. Funding for the program significantly increased from $100,000 in 2022 to $16.65 million in 2023 as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act. ### Hoy, el congresista Henry Cuellar, Ph.D. (TX-28) anunció $3,120,000 en fondos federales para la silvicultura en los patios escolares de Laredo. Los fondos, otorgados por el Servicio Forestal de Texas A&M, fueron posibles gracias a la Ley de Reducción de la Inflación, que el Dr. Cuellar ayudó a aprobar en 2022. “Las comodidades de calidad del campus fomentan un ambiente de aprendizaje positivo para nuestros estudiantes. Los fondos anunciados hoy para el proyecto Adelante con Árboles brindarán una solución forestal urbana única para los estudiantes de Laredo a medida que aprenden más sobre las maravillas naturales de nuestro mundo,” dijo el Dr. Cuellar. “Aplaudo al Servicio Forestal de Texas A&M por utilizar dólares federales disponibles a través de la Ley de Reducción de la Inflación para invertir en el sur de Texas. Gracias a la Dra. Sylvia Guerra Ríos, Superintendente de LISD, y a Tricia Cortez, directora ejecutiva de RGISC, por trabajar conmigo para asegurar estos fondos para los estudiantes de Laredo.” “Más allá de embellecer nuestras escuelas, estos árboles desempeñarán un papel importante para hacer que nuestros campus se sientan más acogedores y atractivos,” afirmó la Superintendente de Escuelas de LISD, Dra. Sylvia G. Ríos. “Nuestros estudiantes verán crecer estos árboles y los conectarán con los gratos recuerdos de su experiencia educativa en LISD.” “Más importante aún, estos árboles también servirán como herramientas útiles para enseñar a nuestros estudiantes sobre el mundo que los rodea y la importancia y la responsabilidad que todos compartimos en el cuidado de nuestro medio ambiente,” exclamó Dr. Ríos. “Estamos muy agradecidos de recibir una subvención tan generosa y, como tal, estamos comprometidos a trabajar junto con nuestros socios comunitarios para impactar positivamente el mundo en el que vivimos,” reiteró Dr. Ríos. “Este es un día especial para tal anuncio; no sólo se llevará a cabo en el Día de la Tierra, sino que representa un nuevo paso adelante para nuestra ciudad fronteriza del sur de Texas. Este proyecto de Laredo fue uno de los cinco seleccionados en todo Texas y habla del compromiso de nuestra comunidad de aumentar la copa de los árboles nativos en Laredo ISD, brindar oportunidades de aprendizaje al aire libre para los estudiantes y comenzar a abordar el cambio climático y la isla de calor urbano severo en el centro de la ciudad,” dijo Tricia Cortez, directora ejecutiva de RGISC. Este premio ayudará al Distrito Escolar Independiente de Laredo (LISD) y al Centro de Estudios Internacionales Rio Grande (RGISC) a implementar su proyecto Adelante con Árboles para plantar árboles y aumentar la cobertura de copas de árboles en un 30% en ocho escuelas de Laredo: El proyecto brindará a los estudiantes mayores oportunidades de educación al aire libre, creará conciencia ambiental, creará áreas especiales al aire libre para niños con autismo y abordará la escasez de arbolistas certificados en Laredo. Este año, el Servicio Forestal de Texas A&M anunció una histórica donación de $15,4 millones en subvenciones a través de su Programa de Subvenciones Forestales. El objetivo del programa es construir bosques urbanos y comunitarios más saludables en todo el estado, que son esenciales para el bienestar económico, ambiental, físico y mental de todos los tejanos. La financiación del programa aumentó significativamente de $100,000 en 2022 a $16,65 millones en 2023 como resultado de la Ley de Reducción de la Inflación. ###"
April 22,Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan,D,Northern Marianas Islands,$98k for CJPA,"U.S. Congressman Washington, D.C. - Congressman Michael C. Burgess, M.D. (R-TX), Chairman of the House Rules Committee, joined the Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee in questioning Secretary Xavier Becerra of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on the Fiscal Year 2025 Department of HHS Budget.

Chairman Burgess highlighted the Biden Administration's failed attempts of enhancing the wellbeing of Americans and questioned Secretary Becerra on what the Administration is doing to curb health care consolidation, preserve independent practices and small providers, and address high health care costs.  Click HERE for Video. 
On the importance of preserving independent practice and addressing provider consolidation:
 “Would you agree that provider consolidation is a problem that needs to be addressed?,” asked Chairman Burgess. 

""That's something we've had forever, there's no reason why consolidation should mean that there shouldn't be independent practice,"" said Secretary Becerra. 
 ""I’m glad you feel that way. I think that the presence of independent physicians is an invaluable counterweight to the rise of consolidation in our health care marketplace. What is this Administration doing to help preserve independent practice as an option for physicians and patients?” asked Chairman Burgess.
 ""We continue to work within the industry to make sure that no consolidation is occurring for monopolistic purposes. We work with the Department of Justice on that. We try to keep prices competitive. I would probably agree with you if you were to ask me if removing those independent practitioners is going to lead to higher prices and I would probably tell you it absolutely does,"" said Secretary Becerra. ""It's going to lead the worst patient care and that's really what we should be concerned about. I mean it's one thing to spend a lot of money, it's another thing to spend a lot of money and not deliver the care that people really need,"" said Chairman Burgess.
   On requesting commitment from the Biden administration to address the current disruptive payment rules, preserve independent practice, reduce health care consolidation, and lower costs for American patients:
 ""Would you consider modifying the upcoming Physician Fee Schedule so that it does not involve the large budget neutrality adjustment and offers facility physicians stability, in cost contrast to many decades of disruptive payment rules?"" asked Chairman Burgess.

""That's a dance we have to engage with together. Congress set the rules, the new budget neutrality rules we have to follow. More than willing to work with you because again, if it doesn't really deal with the reality of what the practitioner on the ground has to face, we all should take a closer look."" said Secretary Becerra. 
 
""Well here's the problem. We need to ensure that this year's physician fee schedule doesn't continue the cycle of large budget neutrality adjustments that drive conversion factors down for providers,"" said Chairman Burgess.

""So look, we got a problem. The Affordable Care Act to CMMI was also going to save money, it doesn't. Poorly constructed models favoring large health organizations, consistent, disruptive payment rules, driving consolidation. What we just heard this week about the change health care problems driving consolidation. It seems intuitively obvious to the casual observer that this Administration prefers larger health care systems and neglect smaller providers. For example, why hasn't this Administration embraced ideas, such as site neutral payment reform to lower costs for the patients and reduced consolidation, something that has been included in President's budget's for over a decade?"" asked Chairman Burgess.
 ""I'd be more than willing to discuss with you the ways that we have continued to try to sustain the smaller providers because the smaller providers are typically the ones that are in rural America. They're typically the ones that are in lower income America, and we desperately need to keep them in place. We have promulgated a number of policies that support smaller providers. We want to avoid them being gobbled up by the big guys,"" said Secretary Becerra. ""Here's a pro tip. Site neutrality can replace budget neutrality. We can afford this. We have the dollars within the system, we can afford to do this, it is just the will to deliver on that,"" said Chairman Burgess. 

""What is the cost per enrollee in the Affordable Care Act?"" asked Chairman Burgess.
 ""That would depend on the plan that they purchase, what their income level is, what the level of subsidy would be."" said Secretary Becerra. ""You say that the cost of care is basically cost plus to Americans but it's not. Americans are paying this bill, and now they're paying highest interest rates on the money they're having to borrow for what you're giving away,"" said Chairman Burgess.

April 19,Kevin McCarthy,R,Calif.-20,"What They’re Saying: Conservatives, Faith Leaders, Advocacy Organizations Support House National Security Supplemental Legislation","Roughly six months after the brutal attacks by the Iranian-backed Hamas terrorists, the world watched as Iran launched its own direct and unprecedented attack on Israel. As our closest ally in the Middle East faces more threats to their very existence, it’s important now more than ever that Congress stands up to authoritarian aggression to support Israel.  While I’m sure words of well wishes for our ally are appreciated, it’s sound and expeditious policy that will make an impact in Israel’s fight to defend itself. That’s why House Republicans acted swiftly this week to bring a slate of bills, including several I cosponsored, to stand with Israel and respond to Iran’s heinous attacks. It’s known that Iran is one of the world’s foremost sponsors of terrorism. Yet, in 2008, the Obama Administration set an unruly precedent of appeasing Iran, which Biden has compounded since he took office.  Most recently, as the Iranian-backed Hamas terrorists were planning their attacks, the Biden Administration waived sanctions to allow $6 billion in Iranian funds to be transferred to banks in Qatar and later reissued a waiver that gave Iran access to more than $10 billion. The Iranian regime is highly skilled in evasion, cutting corners, and blurring lines to hide the true use of these funds, and the Biden Administration is compliant and complicit in these efforts. Any funding given to Iran, even if nominally in a restricted account, frees up funds for them to use on malign activities. Iran is too potent a threat for these waivers to exist any longer, so the House voted to pass a bill I cosponsored, H.R. 5947, to eliminate any waivers and licenses related to Iran that would allow Biden to take such actions again. I will not stand by while the Biden Administration continues to show weakness on the world stage. I will continue working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to advance comprehensive policies to prioritize the security of the U.S. and our allies."

April 20,Kevin McCarthy,R,Calif.-20,RealClearPolitics Profile of Speaker Johnson: “A Beleaguered Gentleman: Speaker Mike Johnson”,"Washington, D.C. – Today, Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries spoke on the House Floor against pro-Putin extremists who have obstructed our national security and in support of the urgent bipartisan national security package to stand with our allies and protect the American people. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the legislative package that is before the Congress. For months, the national security priorities of the American people have been obstructed by pro-Putin extremists determined to let Russia win. A bipartisan coalition of Democrats and Republicans has risen up to work together and ensure that we are getting the national security legislation important to the American people over the finish line. House Democrats have risen to the occasion. President Joe Biden has risen to the occasion. Traditional conservatives led by Speaker Mike Johnson have risen to the occasion. We have a responsibility, not as Democrats or Republicans but as Americans, to do what is necessary to defend democracy wherever it is at risk in the best interest of the free world. That is what this legislation represents. We have a responsibility to push back against tyranny. We have a responsibility to push back against totalitarianism. We have a responsibility to push back against terror. And we have a responsibility to stand with our democratic allies throughout the world. Israel is a democratic ally. Ukraine is a democratic ally. South Korea is a democratic ally. Taiwan is a democratic ally. Japan is a democratic ally. We have a responsibility to stand with our democratic allies throughout the world. We also have a responsibility to push back against our adversaries. Russia is not our friend. The Chinese Communist Party is not our friend. Iran is not our friend. We have a special relationship that exists between the United States and Israel. It’s a relationship that is anchored in shared values and shared interests. Our commitment to Israel’s security is ironclad. Israel has a right to exist as a Jewish and democratic state and safe haven for the Jewish people, who have faced centuries of persecution throughout the years. The events of October 7 make clear that Hamas must be decisively defeated for the good of Israel, for the good of the Palestinian people, for the good of peace in the Middle East, for the good of the free world. Hamas must be decisively defeated. At the same time, there are other urgent priorities. We must do everything possible to make sure that we are freeing the hostages so they can safely return to their families and do everything possible to surge humanitarian assistance into Gaza so we can help out Palestinian civilians who are in harm’s way through no fault of their own. We must surge in food, surge in medicine, surge in humanitarian assistance. That is what this package will help accomplish with more than $9 billion in humanitarian assistance. The events of October 7 and the suffering of Palestinian civilians in a theater of war a heartbreaking.  Any person of goodwill should come to the conclusion that we have to find a way to achieve a just and lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinian people. And the only way for that to happen is for us to truly commit to a two-state solution when the moment presents itself with a safe and secure Israel living side by side in peace and prosperity with a demilitarized Palestinian state that provides dignity and self-determination for the Palestinian people. Let us recommit to accomplishing that objective. The humanitarian assistance in this legislative package will also allow the United States to be there to support people who are suffering all across the world, including millions in Haiti and millions in the Sudan dealing with famine and starvation in a war-torn environment. This legislation, of course, will allow us to stand with our allies in the Indo-Pacific in the face of continued aggression from the Chinese Communist Party to make sure that freedom and democracy and these values all across the world will continue to be triumphant. This legislation will allow us to support the bravery and the courage of the Ukrainian people, who, against all odds, continue to stand for what we as Americans believe in. In February of 2022, we were told that Ukraine would likely fall in a week and that Russian troops would be in Kiev in a week. But the bravery, the courage, the resilience of the Ukrainian people in the face of the most powerful military in Europe has proven to be consequential in partnership with American support and that of our NATO allies. But the Ukrainian people have taught us something, that in the face of an incredible military apparatus that they were confronting, against all odds, that when a people believe in freedom or liberty or democracy, that can overcome even the mightiest of militaries. And so we’ve seen them, despite the prediction that they would fall in a week, inflict more than 300,000 casualties on the Russian military, significant portions of the Russian navy wiped out in the Black Sea, more than half the territory that had initially been seized by the Russian military recaptured by Ukraine against all odds. But the pro-Putin obstruction that has stopped this national security legislation from advancing to the floor until this point risks all of the progress that has been made, which is why it’s so essential for us to do what is necessary to stand with the Ukrainian people. Let me close with this observation that this is a moment to choose. This is a moment to choose. We can choose democracy or autocracy. We can choose freedom or tyranny. We can choose truth or propaganda. We can choose Ukraine or Russia. We can choose Zelenskyy or Putin. We can choose a democratic ally or a sworn enemy. This is a time to choose. The American people have always stood on the side of democracy and freedom and truth, which is why we must stand on the side of the Ukrainian people. We will stand with the Ukrainian people today. We will stand with the Ukrainian people tomorrow. We will stand with the Ukrainian people until victory is won. Subscribe to our e-newsletter that provides updates

April 22,Ayanna Pressley,D,Mass.-7,"Pressley, Warren Celebrate $1M Secured for Black Economic Council of Massachusetts","April 19, 2024  Dear Friend,  This week, the dysfunctional Republican leadership finally produced bills for aid to Israel and Ukraine and scheduled a vote for Saturday. The support for Ukraine is long overdue, and I will vote in favor of it, in addition to aid to Israel and for the civilian population of Gaza. I also met in my Washington office with the President of the University of Tennessee and the Chancellor of Rutgers University-Camden, planned to attend next week’s grand opening of the Orange Mound Library in the former Melrose High School, condemned the current Turkish government for human rights abuses, welcomed the Senate’s quick dismissal of the spurious impeachment charges against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, offered some guidance on President Biden’s most recent effort to reduce student loan debt, and offered a health tip tied to warming temperatures. Keep reading and follow me on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to see what I am doing as it happens.  Expecting to Vote for Aid to Support Israel and Ukraine Meeting with University President and Chancellor Looking Forward to the Grand Opening of the Orange Mound Library Condemning Turkey’s Political Oppression Welcoming Dismissal of Mayorkas Impeachment Hoax Offering Guidance on Student Loan Forgiveness Weekly Health Tip Quote of the Week Expecting to Vote for Aid to Support Israel and Ukraine  The dysfunctional Republican leadership of the House has finally scheduled votes on aid to Israel and to Ukraine for Saturday, and I will vote for both measures. The delay in offering support to Ukraine has resulted in reversals on the battlefield and additional loss of life from both military and civilian populations, so providing this assistance is crucial. The measures will also provide military aid to Israel and humanitarian aid to the starving civilian population of Gaza, as well as assistance to Taiwan. Iran’s shooting 300 drones, rockets and missiles at Israel brought this issue to the fore with the need to replenish Israel’s weapons supply. Depending on the outcome Saturday, Speaker Mike Johnson could be seen as a profile in courage for risking his political career for a noble cause. I commend him for scheduling these votes and will support him if there is a motion, as threatened, to vacate the speakership.  Meeting with University President and Chancellor  Chancellor Tillis, Congressman Cohen and President Boyd On Wednesday, University of Tennessee President Randy Boyd and Rutgers University-Camden Chancellor Antonio Tillis visited my Washington office to discuss their education priorities. With President Boyd, we discussed the Tennessee Lottery I passed as a state Senator that provides so many scholarships to U.T. students and others. With Chancellor Tillis, I commended him on his commitment to attracting talented students from Memphis to his prestigious New Jersey university, particularly the “pipeline” he has created between Rutgers and Hamilton High School.  Condemning Turkey’s Political Oppression  My late Congressional colleague Tom Lantos was a champion of human rights, and I am proud to be a member of the commission created in his name. The Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission held a hearing on Tuesday with expert witnesses on the ongoing oppression in Turkey. Among the hearing witnesses was Enes Kanter Freedom, a human rights activist and former NBA basketball player who was punished by the NBA for expressing his political views about the lack of human rights in China. See my questioning of witnesses here.   Looking Forward to Orange Mound Library Grand Opening Next Friday, April 26, I plan to attend the grand opening of the Orange Mound Library at the former Melrose High School for which I secured $3 million in community project funding. The transformation of the school is an inspiring example of what happens when federal funding is invested in our community.  Welcoming Dismissal of Mayorkas Impeachment Hoax  The U.S. Senate made fast work of the meritless impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Wednesday, dismissing both baseless charges in less than three hours. I voted against the impeachment hoax and was pleased to see the Senate toss it aside without debate. Sadly, many in the press wondered if this kind of spectacle means the Senate is becoming like the House – a political, not a policy-based chamber.  Offering Guidance on Student Loan Forgiveness President Biden’s latest action to erase student loan debt is projected to extend relief to more than 30 million Americans. This is benefiting people of all ages — from young people who are new to the job market to moms and dads who have been paying off old loans with sky-high interest rates for years. The new plan will cancel runaway interest for millions; it will automatically cancel debt for borrowers who are eligible for programs like SAVE and PSLF but just haven’t applied; it will cancel debt for borrowers who entered repayment decades ago and for people who enrolled in programs with low –financial value programs; and it will provide debt relief for people who are experiencing serious financial hardship. The Biden Administration has already helped four million people save $146 billion on student loan debt, and this is another big step in the right direction.   Weekly Health Tip  Besides the cicadas we anticipate seeing as temperatures rise, the heat also brings mosquito season to our region.

April 22,Kathy Castor,D,Fla.-14,U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor Announces $156M to Expand Solar in the Sunshine State,"502 Cannon HOB, Washington, DC 20515Email Me(202) 225-6435 On April 13, Israel endured an unprecedented attack of more than 300 long-range missiles and drones from Iran. The Islamic Republic of Iran has been a sworn enemy of Israel since the 1979 Iranian revolution and is the primary state sponsor of terrorist groups such as Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthi movement in Yemen. However, Iranian forces had never launched a direct barrage against Israel from its own territory prior to last week. Miraculously, 99 percent of the projectiles were intercepted by Israel’s Iron Dome and David’s Sling defense systems and a coalition including American, British, French, Jordanian, and Saudi forces. This demonstrated the vital need for such defense systems and the hard-won success of U.S.-led cooperation with regional partners to promote security. It’s an understatement to say Israel is in a dangerous neighborhood; Iran and its proxies have sworn to eliminate the state. Without the historic Abraham Accords negotiated by the Trump administration in 2020 and the subsequent intelligence coordination with Arab countries, thwarting Iran’s bombardment to such a degree may not have been possible. In the face of Iran's attack, our ally Israel deserves our full support. Tensions between the two Middle East nations have run high for decades, and the sheer scale of Iran’s attack is a blatant escalation which must be met with solidarity and strength. This week, the House considered a resolution I cosponsored condemning this attack and affirming Israel’s right to self-defense. It passed by a vote of 404-14. I am also a cosponsor of the No U.S. Financing for Iran Act (H.R.5921) and the Standing Against Houthi Aggression Act (H.R.6046). Both passed the House this week with my support. The Biden administration has made the mistakes of relaxing economic sanctions on Iran and weakening terrorist designations for the Houthis who have been committing acts of terror in the Red Sea, disrupting one of the world’s busiest shipping routes, since the October 7 attacks by Hamas. While President Biden sought to make $6 billion available to Iran in an August 2023 appeasement deal, H.R. 5921 would increase financial pressure on the government of Iran. H.R. 6046 would fully reinstate Houthi terrorist designations removed by the administration in 2021. Since the devastating and tragic October 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas, the terrorist group continues to hold hostages, including American citizens. Very troublingly, it cannot account for the number of hostages they once were thought to have. Hamas must ensure the safe release of all hostages. Israel certainly has the right to respond to the attacks they have suffered, and they are still responding. It is important for us to stand behind Israel and our friends around the world who seek to do the right thing. Israel will need to replenish critical munitions and its defense systems following the onslaught by Iran. We should likewise do what we can to share the resources they need to stand for the cause of freedom. ###"
April 22,Henry Cuellar,D,Tex.-28,"Rep. Cuellar Announces $3,120,000 in Federal Funds for Schoolyard Forestry in Laredo","April 20, 2024 WASHINGTON – Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) issued the following statement on her votes today on the House’s votes on foreign military aid packages for Israel, Ukraine..  Yesterday, Rep. Pressley filed a pair of amendments to increase funding to global humanitarian assistance and place a one-year moratorium on the transfer of offensive weapons to the Israeli military. The amendments were not adopted in the final legislation.  “In this moment of growing global conflict, I have consistently advocated for policies and budgets that save lives, promote de-escalation, and work toward peace across the globe. “It is unconscionable that Congress would consider sending more offensive weapons and funding to the Israeli military, which for months has operated with callous disregard for human life in Gaza and perpetrated significant human rights violations. Over 34,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces, millions of civilians in Gaza are on the brink of famine, and over 100 hostages are still held captive by Hamas. While I support Israel’s right to defend itself—especially following the horrific October 7th attack and I grieve deeply for those impacted—we cannot bomb our way to peace and become complicit as the Netaynahu government continues to massacre the Palestinian people. I voted NO on H.R. 8034 and continue to call for the United States to facilitate a lasting, bilateral ceasefire to save lives, return all hostages, deliver meaningful humanitarian aid to Gaza, and negotiate a long-term diplomatic solution that results in a just and lasting peace for Israelis and Palestinians alike.” “I also believe Congress should provide long-overdue assistance to help the Ukrainian people defend themselves against Vladimir Putin’s unjust and illegal invasion. This conflict has claimed the lives of tens of thousands of innocent people and displaced millions of others, and my heart breaks for the Ukrainian and Russian civilians who have had to deal with this unspeakable trauma. While I never take a vote on military aid lightly and believe diplomacy and humanitarian aid should be the priority, we have an obligation to stop Putin’s unjust invasion. I voted YES on H.R. 8035. “I am encouraged that Democrats were able to secure some global humanitarian aid in these bills, which will help mitigate these worsening crises. However, I am deeply disappointed that the Republican majority did not consider my amendment to drastically surge humanitarian aid to address the crises in Gaza and Ukraine, as well as in Haiti, Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan, and others. We must continue to prioritize global humanitarian assistance, including restoring critical funding for UNWRA. “As a parent, woman of faith, and caregiver, I pray that we can build a world where all of our children can thrive and know peace, whether they’re in Massachusetts, Gaza, Ukraine, Israel, or Haiti.”  Since the horrific October 7th attack, Congresswoman Pressley has consistently and stridently called for a ceasefire to save lives, return all hostages, and surge humanitarian aid to Gaza. This week, Rep. Pressley delivered a floor speech in which she called or urgent de-escalation in the Middle East and renewed her calls for a ceasefire in Gaza to prevent a broader regional war. As Co-Chair of the House Haiti Caucus, Rep. Pressley has also led calls for extending Temporary Protected Status for Haiti, a halt to deportations, a Haitian-led democratic transition, the delivery of humanitarian, economic and security assistance to the island, and more. Throughout the Israel and Hamas conflict, Rep. Pressley has been a vocal and consistent advocate of diplomacy, de-escalation, and saving lives. ### Washington DC Office 402 Cannon HOB

Today is, in many ways, Congress’ first official vote where we can weigh in on the direction of this war. If Congress votes to continue to supply offensive military aid, we make ourselves complicit in this tragedy.  “Our votes against H.R. 8034 are votes against supplying more offensive weapons that could result in more killings of civilians in Rafah and elsewhere. We believe strongly in Israel’s right to self-defense and have joined colleagues previously in affirming our shared commitment. “All of us support strengthening the Iron Dome and other defense systems and we are committed to a sovereign, safe, and secure future for Israel. To protect that future, we believe the United States must help achieve a ceasefire that allows hostages to be freed, humanitarian aid to be delivered, and peace talks to begin. “Benjamin Netanyahu appears willing to sacrifice the hostages while inflicting extraordinary suffering on the people of Gaza. He is willing to expand this conflict to preserve his power at the expense of Israel’s safety. In recent weeks, reports have indicated that Netanyahu is moving closer to a full-scale invasion of the southern Gaza town of Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians have taken shelter. When faced with the question of whether to provide offensive aid to further this conflict, we believe there is a moral imperative to find another path. “Most Americans do not want our government to write a blank check to further Prime Minister Netanyahu’s war in Gaza. The United States needs to help Israel find a path to win the peace.”  ###

April 20,Bill Posey,R,Fla.-8,Posey Votes to Block Foreign Aid Bill that Borrows Another $100 Billion,"Subscribe to receive the latest news, insights, and updates directly to your inbox. WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor (FL-14) released the below statement on House passage of the bipartisan  national security package: “Democracy and freedom won today as a bipartisan majority – 210 Democrats and 101 Republicans – voted to provide emergency security and humanitarian aid to Ukraine. Despite months of delay at the hands of MAGA Republicans, I’m confident that America and our allies will be better equipped to stand strong and united against authoritarians like Vladimir Putin. “The security package provides support for the people of Ukraine and Israel while also providing much-needed humanitarian assistance to civilians affected by conflicts – including millions of Palestinians who continue to face an urgent humanitarian crisis as water and food supplies dwindle. “This package will help Israel defend itself from Hamas and Iran by replenishing the Iron Dome missile defense system that has protected the people of Israel and was pivotal in minimizing the impact of Iran’s recent attack. “The package also provides crucial resources for U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), headquartered at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, and the operations in the Middle East area of responsibility so that our military can respond to attacks on American interests by Iranian proxies. “Strategic investments in the Indo-Pacific will deter aggression from China and help maintain peace and stability throughout the region.  “I am thankful Speaker Johnson finally scheduled the vote, but the harm inflicted on civilians, our allies, our global standing and our national security at the hands of MAGA Republicans’ delay tactics will not be forgotten. Democrats again proved to be the governing majority with devotion to our democratic values and commitment to freedom at home and abroad.”"
April 22,Morgan Griffith,R,Va.-9,"Griffith Announces $2,578,604 HHS Grant to Tri-Area Community Health","CHERRY HILL, NJ – Today, Rep. Donald Norcross (D-NJ) voted in support of the Israel, Ukraine, and Taiwan security packages to provide military aid and assistance to our partners and allies and strengthen democracy around the world.   The security packages voted on today by the House of Representatives will provide $26.4 to Israel, $60.8 billion to Ukraine, and $8.1 billion to Taiwan in security assistance.     “The House of Representatives made clear today that we continue to stand firmly on the side of freedom and democracy. The security packages we passed will continue America’s long-standing and steadfast security support of Israel, ensure Ukraine is sustained in their fight against Russian aggression, and provide Taiwan with needed military assistance to deter China, as well as deliver lifesaving humanitarian aid to millions of civilians living in conflict zones around the world. These packages are also an important investment in our domestic industrial base and will directly support good-paying jobs in South Jersey and across the United States,” Rep. Norcross said. “Let’s be clear: two months ago, House Republican leadership failed to hold a vote on the bipartisan Senate-passed security supplemental because they caved to extremist members of their caucus who wanted to block this desperately needed aid. While today’s packages provide our partners and allies with the tools and resources they need to defend themselves, this delay undoubtedly cost lives. As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I will continue to work to ensure that Israel can defend itself against terrorists, Ukraine can defeat Putin, and Taiwan can deter Chinese aggression. I’m proud to stand with our allies and partners and strengthen democracy around the world.”    The government spending package is expected to be passed by the Senate and signed into law by President Joe Biden.    Highlights from the funding package can be found below:   These security packages also take advantage of South Jersey’s defense industrial base and support good-paying jobs with aid money used to purchase artillery and weapons systems components from manufacturers in the region.   Rep. Norcross was a part of the first congressional delegation visit to Israel in the days following the October 7 attack.   Rep. Norcross, Sen. Ernst, and a bipartisan, bicameral congressional delegation returned to the Middle East in early January to reaffirm support for Israel, meet with regional officials and partners about challenges, and advocate for the safe and secure return of U.S. citizens taken hostage by Hamas. He also led an op-ed with Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) on the important role that Congress has in bringing the hostages home.   In March, Rep. Norcross welcomed Yael Alexander, the mother of New Jerseyan Edan Alexander who remains held hostage by Hamas, as his State of the Union guest to highlight the continued hostage crisis.   ### Permalink: https://norcross.house.gov/2024/4/rep-norcross-votes-in-support-of-israel-ukraine-taiwan-security-package-to-provide-military-aid-and-assistance"

April 19,Bruce Westerman,R,Ark.-4,We Must Stand Firm Against Aggression,"            Rep. Chris Smith (R-Manchester) today voted in favor of comprehensive legislation (HR 3602) to secure the US southern border as President Biden refuses to resolve the ongoing crisis with existing executive authorities available to him.             “The chaos at our southern border constitutes a grave national security and humanitarian crisis that continues to put the lives of so many at risk,” said Rep. Smith.             “President Biden’s open border policies—and his outright refusal to implement existing executive authorities—not only emboldens human traffickers and those bringing deadly fentanyl into our country but also gives false hope to desperate people willing to risk their own health and survival, even as they are cruelly exploited by ruthless cartels and traffickers,” said Smith.             According to House Republican Leadership, the End the Border Catastrophe Act:             · Forces the Biden Administration to restart construction of the border wall;             · Ends catch and release and the abuse of parole;             · Implements the “Remain in Mexico” policy;             · Increases the number of Border Patrol agents and provides bonus pay;             · Requires transparency from the Department of Homeland Security regarding illegal border crossings;             · Strengthens current law to protect unaccompanied children from human trafficking;             · Strengthens and streamlines the asylum process; and             · Imposes additional penalties for overstaying a visa.             “This comprehensive legislation will put an end to the ongoing catastrophe at our border and make sure that all those traveling to the country are properly vetted and processed,” said Smith, who also strongly supported and voted for the Secure our Border Act of 2023 (HR 2).             “While our Nation continues its longstanding tradition to welcome those in search of a better life for them and their families, we must ensure that our immigration policies do not jeopardize the safety of the American people,” Smith said. ### Chris has three offices dedicated to constituent services.

April 20,Mike Kelly,R,Pa.-16,"Kelly supports foreign aid package, legislation to secure the border","            Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ) today took to the House Floor during debate and urged his colleagues to pass legislation (HR 8034) that would provide more than $26 billion in critical military assistance to Israel while prohibiting any US funds from flowing to the failed and pervasively antisemitic United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) in Gaza. The bill was passed by the House in a vote of 366-58.


             “The United States must make absolutely clear in both word and deed, not just today, but every day—and without equivocation—that we stand with Israel,” said Smith, the Co-Chair of the Israel Allies Caucus.             “Both defensive weapons systems like Iron Dome and David’s Sling and all necessary offensive military capabilities must be conveyed without delay to Israel for as long as it takes to defeat Hamas and to deter Iran, Hezbollah, and other radical Islamists,” Smith said.             Smith, who has led efforts in Congress to expose UNRWA’s rampant antisemitism, said the legislation will prohibit US funding for the problematic UN agency. The measure mirrors Smith’s own bill—the Stop Support for UNRWA Act of 2024 (HR 7122)—that was passed by the House Foreign Affairs Committee in February.             “Of significance, HR 8034 prohibits aid to Gaza from flowing through UNRWA, an antisemitic disgraceful organization that teaches Palestinian children to hate Jews and glorifies suicidal martyrdom and the evisceration of Israel as a state,” said Smith, who has chaired three hearings over the past ten months on UNRWA’s unbridled antisemitism and recently joined an international panel of experts in Geneva to highlight the issue.             “UNRWA is a child soldiers factory that we have funded for decades,” Smith continued. “Twenty-one years ago—on this Floor in 2003—I offered an amendment that passed the House to defund UNRWA. The Senate never acted.”             “A few weeks ago, the Foreign Affairs Committee passed my bill to stop UNRWA funding,” said Smith. “HR 8034 defunds UNRWA.”             “Israel has an absolute right to exist—free from aggression and antisemitic hate,” Smith said.             According to the House Republican Leadership, the Israel Security Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2024 includes:             · $4 billion to replenish Iron Dome and David’s Sling missile defense systems;             · $1.2 billion for the Iron Beam defense system;             · $3.5 billion for the procurement of advanced weapons systems, defense articles, and defense services through the Foreign Military Financing Program;             · $1 billion to enhance the production and development of artillery and critical munitions;             · $4.4 billion to replenish defense articles and defense services provided to Israel;             · $2.4 billion for current US military operations in response to recent attacks;             · $9 billion for worldwide humanitarian aid; and             · $400 million to help secure non-profit institutions in America, including from  increased threats of antisemitism;              · Provides flexibility for transfers of defense articles to Israel from US stockpiles; and             · Prohibits funds to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). ### Chris has three offices dedicated to constituent services.

Burgess, M.D. (R-TX), Chairman of the House Committee on Rules released the following statement on the passage of the security supplemental package.  ""President Biden’s failed strategy of ‘peace through weakness’, does not work,"" said House Rules Committee Chairman Burgess. ""The United States must stand behind our allies as they face a dark new world. Israel, Taiwan, and Ukraine are all confronting emboldened adversaries who threaten their continued existence. Today, I voted to support the security supplemental package that will counter the violent aggression against our allies and condemn Iran’s, China’s, and Russia’s remorseless, inhumane actions. President Biden’s failed leadership destabilized and weakened our global security, leaving the free world to a cruel fate. Our adversaries are watching earnestly to see how America will respond and our allies are looking for us to stand with them as they fight for their nation and freedom. I’m glad the House answered the call to deliver critical defense assistance to our friends in need.""   ### Get the most up to date news from me on Twitter."
April 21,Hakeem Jeffries,D,N.Y.-8,LEADER JEFFRIES FLOOR SPEECH IN SUPPORT OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY FUNDING PACKAGE,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Representative Virginia Foxx (R-NC) issued the following statement after the House passed the National Security Supplemental that provides resources for Israel, the Indo-Pacific, Ukraine, as well as additional measures to counter foreign aggression in each region: “By allowing for a transparent and constructive process, the People’s House has created a stronger outcome of fulfilling our obligations to our allies in their time of need. The first step in quashing the possibility of a foreign war is enacting impactful deterrence measures. Without question, this is an axis versus allies moment, and deterrence is the optimal way to stop Iran, China, North Korea, and Russia in their tracks. If we were to have accepted the Senate’s blank check for foreign aid without reservation, this process would have never yielded a strong, ironclad product.  “That said, I was proud to support separate amendments during this process, specifically relating to Ukraine, with the sole intention of keeping aid targeted and narrow in scope. These amendments involved eliminating all non-military funding to Ukraine as well as to block an increase in the President’s drawdown authority and foreign military financing. Europe must also step up to the plate and ensure that Ukraine remains on a direct path to self-reliance so that this caliber of assistance is not necessary in the future. In the end, there remained a clear imperative of providing necessary assistance – and we rose to meet the moment.”"
April 19,Steve Cohen,D,Tenn.-9,Expecting to Vote for Aid to Support Israel and Ukraine,"Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H. R. 4639, the Fourth Amendment Is Not For Sale Act.  As Ranking Member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, my priority is our national security and to protect Americans from foreign threats. Our Intelligence Community agencies at times purchase what is known as “commercially available information” from data brokerage companies to gather information on foreign spies and bad actors, and to protect America from malign foreign influence. When they purchase this data, they cannot be certain that it is entirely free of any U.S. citizen’s information. In order to protect citizens, agencies are already required to take steps to ensure that this incidentally obtained data is removed.  However, these data brokerage companies collect the personal information of Americans through their social media profiles, public records, and other commercial sources. They then sell this information to companies, organizations, or any entity with an interest in collecting data on American citizens – including foreign adversaries like China, Russia, or even cartels. H.R. 4639 would do nothing to keep any of these other entities from exploiting and sharing American’s data.   Instead of prohibiting our own intelligence agencies from accessing commercially available information to obtain foreign intelligence, we must take steps to address the broader vulnerability of Americans’ data. Congress needs to take steps to protect Americans, not undermine our Intelligence agencies and put the United States at a deep disadvantage against our adversaries.  Thank you, and I yield back. "
April 19,Adrian Smith,R,Neb.-3,Supporting Israels Right to Self-Defense," Washington, D.C. -- Congressman Paul A. Gosar, D.D.S. (AZ-09), issued the following statement after cosponsoring H.Res. 1103, Declaring the office of Speaker of the House of Representatives to be vacant, also known as the motion to vacate.  “Nearly 11 million illegal aliens have crossed our southern border in the past three years.  My congressional district in Arizona, ground zero for the invasion, is getting pummeled by the surge of lawbreakers. These illegal aliens have brought violent crime, deadly drugs, human trafficking and are depleting resources and services meant for U.S. citizens.  In fact, every state has become a border state.  Communities across the country are being ravaged, families are being destroyed and Americans in need are being ignored.    Congress cannot continue to turn a blind eye to the consequence of Biden’s disastrous open border policies, nor can it idly wait for Biden to halt this invasion through executive fiat.  Congress has the responsibility to solve this crisis.  Yet rather than spending the resources to secure our southern border and combating the invasion of 11 million illegals and despite repeated promises there would be no additional money going to Ukraine without first securing our border, the United States House of Representatives, under the direction of the Speaker, is on the verge of sending another $61 billion to further draw America into an endless and purposeless war in Ukraine. I have added my name in support of the motion to vacate the Speaker.  Our border cannot be an afterthought.  We need a Speaker who puts America first rather than bending to the reckless demands of the warmongers, neo-cons and the military industrial complex making billions from a costly and endless war half a world away,” concluded Congressman Gosar.   ###"

April 20,Kathy Castor,D,Fla.-14,U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor Statement on House Passage of Bipartisan National Security Package,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE April 16, 2024 Congressman Trone Calls for Increased Funding for Job Training and Health Care, Improved Outcomes for the Bureau of Prisons in Hearing with AG Garland Congressman David Trone questions Attorney General Garland during the Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations Subcommittee hearing.  WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Congressman David Trone (D-MD) questioned Attorney General Garland during a Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations Subcommittee hearing. During the hearing, Trone asked questions about the Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) staffing shortages, ID cards, telemedicine, solitary confinement, de-escalation training, clean slate laws, and the antitrust division.  CONGRESSMAN DAVID TRONE: Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Cartwright, and thank you, Attorney General Garland for appearing here today, and thank you for your patience as you deal with this committee.  I’m a co-chair of the Bipartisan Second Chance Task Force, and we’re concerned about staffing shortages at the BOP. The BOP is funded at 93%.  But we’re only staffed at 86%. What’s happening is education, wraparound services for mental health, etc, which could improve our outcomes, job training, get left behind. So we’re all in agreement on that. We’d like to figure out how to implement the bipartisan First Step Act successfully. And to do that, we’ve got to have the staffing. Could you talk a minute about what this does to lead to lousy outcomes? Where we can’t cut our prison budget because we don’t give folks a second chance to win and succeed.   ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND: I do think that the money we have to provide more incentives for people to stay on the job in the Bureau of Prisons means that the chances of reducing recidivism will increase.  CONGRESSMAN DAVID TRONE: That sounds like a smart investment to me. Second quick question, 75 percent of BOP inmates do not have a photo ID when they leave prison. They can’t secure housing, apply for jobs, open a bank account, federal benefit programs, etc. The Bureau is addressing this by providing IDs to U. S. citizens now. We have a bipartisan bill, the BOP Release Card Act, that supports this effort at the BOP by ensuring new IDs fulfill all the requirements and directs BOP to work with the states to have a one-on-one exchange so we can work right with the states to move these folks into getting their new ID card and then successfully be able to exchange that for state ID cards. So we would appreciate your help in moving this bill forward. Does that make sense to you? ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND: Yeah, we would be happy to give technical assistance. I think we may, our staff may have already, our staffs may have already consulted on this, but of course, we’d be happy to give technical assistance. The BOP has implemented its own release ID program in October of 2023 and they’re on track for implementation by this spring. CONGRESSMAN DAVID TRONE: Excellent. Thank you. The DEA has extended current telemedicine flexibilities for prescribing controlled medications through December 31, ‘24.  But, there’s not a revised proposed rule and many patients are at risk of losing access to prescriptions needed for mental health and substance use disorder. Last year, my colleagues and I expressed concerns about the proposed DEA rule that would have limited patient access to buprenorphine and encourage an evidence-based approach to make permanent the use of audio-only or audio-visual telehealth technology for buprenorphine prescribing. This is crucial to reach these patient populations, including unhoused, rural, and tribal. So as a follow-up to that letter, we introduced the TREATS Act, which allows medication for opioid use disorder to be prescribed via telemedicine. What’s DOJ’s position on the continued use of telehealth flexibilities to ensure access to these medically necessary substance use disorder treatments? And how is this supported in your budget request?  ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND: So as you noted the DEA and HHS have extended the current telemedicine flexibilities until December 31st of this year. DEA has issued a proposed rule, which would allow authorized providers to prescribe medicines for opioid use disorder via telemedicine.  They are working to promulgate a final year by the — I’m sorry a final rule — by the fall of this year.   CONGRESSMAN DAVID TRONE: Okay, excellent. Thank you very much. Just quickly, restrictive housing, otherwise known as solitary confinement, outdated, inhumane practice often used way too far too often. We believe the BOP has been dragging its feet in reforming this area of restrictive housing. In the past 10 years, DOJ has conducted studies and task forces to improve restrictive housing, yet we fail to make any progress. What steps can DOJ and BOP take together so we can make this more effective and improve restrictive housing policies?  ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND: Well, the new BOP director is very much committed to what you’re talking about. BOP recently published a proposed rule on discipline designed to reduce the use of restrictive housing for disciplinary segregation. BOP is trying to hire more psychologists and provide de-escalation training which would help reduce the need for restrictive housing.  CONGRESSMAN DAVID TRONE: Excellent. Thank you very much. I yield back.   SECOND ROUND OF QUESTIONING CONGRESSMAN DAVID TRONE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Last year we helped pass the bipartisan Law Enforcement De-escalation Training Act, which provides 124 million in grant funding over four years for de-escalation training for police officers. This is going to save lives, improve police-community relations. Although this program is new, could you talk briefly about its implementation and more broadly how DOJ’s budget prioritizes mental health and crisis stabilization?  ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND: Yeah, I don’t have the specifics with respect to that program, but as a general matter, our COPS office and our Office of Justice Programs provide de-escalation, money for de-escalation training, it is an important way to protect the lives of officers and first respondents as well as the people who are calling for help. You are also right in the implication of your questions that many of these calls involve people who are mentally ill or have a mental impairment, and that the sensitivity of respondents to that possibility is an important element of the need for de-escalation.   CONGRESSMAN DAVID TRONE: Thank you for your efforts there. 70 to 100 million Americans have criminal records that appear on routine background checks, often preventing them from getting jobs. Over the last seven years, my company has hired about 1,400 returning citizens, which is good for business and cuts down recidivism. Automatic clearing records are costly and have been a barrier to widespread adoption. What resources does the DOJ need to help support these clean slate laws?   ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND: Well, I don’t think I’m, I’m gonna be able to, to talk to you specifically about the Clean Slate laws you know, in the area of criminal justice reform in the implementation of the Second Chance Act, which involves reentry programs, we’re asking for $125 million for those reentry programs. In addition, there is a new program called the Accelerating Justice System Reform Grants, which is a $300 million request for FY25 and $15 billion over 10 years. I’m not sure exactly whether the clean slate would fall within those, but I’ll ask my staff to get back to you on which of the grant programs go to the program here. CONGRESSMAN DAVID TRONE: Yeah, we’d love to keep working with you. Last quick question to build on represent — Ranking Member DeLauro on the antitrust division. Should this committee take another look at the language that eliminates — stops you from having full access to the merger filing fees and locks you into that $233 million?  ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND: Well, I’m gonna leave it to the Members of Congress to resolve this question. The Justice Department is in favor of the antitrust division getting full access to the fees. But you know, in the end, the Congress makes those determinations.  CONGRESSMAN DAVID TRONE: Seems like a good idea. Thank you.  ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND: It does seem like a good idea. Yes.  Congressman David Trone was elected to the House of Representatives in November 2018 to serve the 6th District of Maryland, which includes all or part of Montgomery, Frederick, Washington, Allegany, and Garrett Counties. Trone serves on the Appropriations, Budget, and Joint Economic Committees. In Congress, Trone is fighting to make progress on issues that matter to Marylanders. ###  Are you, or someone you know, struggling with a mental health or substance use disorder? You are not alone.

April 20,Donald W. Norcross,D,N.J.-1,"Rep. Norcross Votes in Support of Israel, Ukraine, Taiwan Security Package to Provide Military Aid and Assistance","FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE April 19, 2024 Trone, Cárdenas Lead Introduction of Resolution Declaring April 2024 as Second Chance Month WASHINGTON, D.C.– Today, U.S. Representatives David Trone (D-MD-6), Tony Cárdenas (D-CA-29), Bruce Westerman (R-AR-4) and Don Bacon (R-NE-2) alongside U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Kevin Cramer (R-ND) reintroduced the bicameral Second Chance Month Resolution. The bicameral, bipartisan effort to designate April 2024 as Second Chance Month serves as reminder of the significant legal and societal barriers for the thousands returning from incarceration each year. In a nation that was founded on new possibilities, this resolution affirms that those who are returning home from jail or prison should have access to rehabilitation, redemption, and the chance to contribute positively to their communities. “Second Chance Month is an opportunity to recognize the importance of providing justice-impacted individuals with a real second chance at rebuilding their lives,” said Congressman David Trone, cofounder, and co-chair of the Second Chance Task Force. “After decades of overcriminalization, our country must make progress toward putting compassion over confinement. This month — and every month — we recommit ourselves to delivering on this promise.”  “Having witnessed firsthand the injustices that countless individuals in my community have faced upon reentry, I’ve made it a priority throughout my years as an elected official to advocate for the resources to make second chances possible,” said Congressman Tony Cárdenas. “In America every person deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, and we must continue to do everything in our power to ensure that people who were formerly incarcerated have access to reentry services and opportunities for a better tomorrow.” “Second Chance Month is an important platform to raise awareness of the challenges that formerly incarcerated individuals, who have paid their debt to society, experience in re-entering their communities,” said Congressman Bruce Westerman. “Opportunity after incarceration is critical to breaking the cycle of crime and reducing recidivism. I’m proud to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in this effort to acknowledge that second chances are paramount in fostering safer communities.” “Sadly, many formerly incarcerated individuals return to the prison system because they haven’t been given the opportunity to benefit from rehabilitation, given a chance at a job or training, and have faced scorn from their fellow man,” said Congressman Don Bacon. “The Second Chance Month Resolution highlights the need to focus on opening doors for those who are reentering society, instead of slamming them shut.” “We praise the Senate and House sponsors of the Second Chance Month resolution, which echoes the values shared by Prison Fellowship and the more than 800 churches and partners who believe that Americans with a criminal record can rise from their past, make amends, and reach their God-given potential,” said Heather Rice-Minus, CEO and President of Prison Fellowship. “We support the passing of this resolution and the lawmakers who strive to remove unfair and unnecessary barriers to work, housing, education, and other fundamentals for citizens who have paid their debt to society so they can live lives of productivity and purpose.” Congressman David Trone was elected to the House of Representatives in November 2018 to serve the 6th District of Maryland, which includes all or part of Montgomery, Frederick, Washington, Allegany, and Garrett Counties.

April 17,Kevin Cramer,R,N.D.,"Legislation Seeks to Overturn Burdensome SEC Climate Disclosure Rule, Protect U.S. Capital Markets","Washington, D.C. -  U.S. Congressman Matt Cartwright (PA-08), a senior member of the powerful House Appropriations Committee and Ranking Member of the Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations Subcommittee, welcomed and addressed U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland at today’s House Appropriations Hearing on the proposed Justice Department’s Fiscal Year 2025 budget request.

A transcript of Cartwright’s remarks, as prepared for delivery, follows: “Thank you, Chairman Mike Rogers, and I would like to echo you in welcoming Attorney General Garland back to the subcommittee to discuss the Department of Justice’s Fiscal Year 2025 budget request.  And thank you, Attorney General Garland, for your continued leadership at the Department, leading the men and women of the DOJ who work tirelessly to continue the pursuit of truth and justice. Resources provided to the Justice Department are and will continue to be under a microscope, but the mission of the Justice Department remains unchanged. I look forward to working with you to ensure we are making smart investments to keep our communities safe. Just last week we had FBI Director Christopher Wray before us and we heard about the real challenges that the FBI, along with its State, local and tribal law enforcement partners, are facing, especially in keeping deadly fentanyl off our streets. I heard Director Wray clearly – State and local law enforcement are asking for more from the FBI – not less.  I trust that could also be said for many other bureaus of the Department.    Further, the defense of our national security and mitigation of emerging foreign and domestic threats, including cyber, is critical – especially in an election year. The Department’s role in upholding the rule of law and preserving our democratic values for free and fair elections cannot be understated.   To carry out the Department’s broad missions, your fiscal year 2025 budget request seeks $38.9 billion in discretionary funding, a 5 percent increase above the fiscal year 2024 enacted level.    It prioritizes funding for the over 100,000 employees of the Department of Justice and makes vital increases to every federal law enforcement agency and the U.S. Attorneys offices.  It includes a strong increase for Violence Against Women Act grants, as well as strong increases for COPS Hiring grants and Byrne JAG formula funding for state and local law enforcement. I look forward to working with Chairman Rogers and the Attorney General on ensuring we sustain investments that our State and local law enforcement partners rely on. Congress cannot ignore the challenges our communities face back home.   Attorney General Garland, once again, welcome, and I look forward to your testimony and working with you on ensuring we provide what the Department of Justice needs for fiscal year 2025.” U.S. Attorney General Garland’s testimony can be found here."
April 17,Kevin Cramer,R,N.D.,Senate Democrats Bury Impeachment Charges Against Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas,"Today, U.S. Representative Matt Cartwright (PA-08) and Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Lawler (NY-17) re-introduced the Help Extend Auditory Relief  (HEAR) Act to expand hearing benefits for seniors on Medicare. Approximately 15 percent of American adults (41 million) report some degree of hearing loss, according to the CDC’s National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). This includes nearly one-third of individuals aged 65-74 and nearly half of those over 75. Left untreated, hearing loss can dramatically impact the health and wellbeing of older adults. Research indicates that older adults with hearing loss experience a faster decline in cognitive abilities and have a greater risk of developing dementia compared to older adults with normal hearing. Hearing loss can also increase social isolation and loneliness and has even been linked to an increased risk for falls, among seniors. For many individuals, hearing aids offer a simple solution. They are dependable, nearly invisible, and can significantly improve quality of life. Yet for older adults on fixed incomes, hearing aids can be prohibitively expensive. This is especially true for older adults who require prescription hearing aids, which can range from $1,000 to $6,000 per pair. Despite this, traditional Medicare does not cover prescription hearing aids or related hearing services. The Help Extend Auditory Relief (HEAR) Act would rectify this by: ·         Requiring Medicare to cover prescription hearing aids; and ·         Requiring Medicare to cover hearing rehabilitation services, including a comprehensive audiology assessment to determine if a hearing aid is appropriate, a threshold test to determine audio acuity, and various services associated with fitting, adjusting, and using hearing aids. “Hearing loss among older Americans is common, and more serious conditions like depression and anxiety often follow if it’s not addressed. Exams and hearing aids are simple ways to mitigate hearing loss, but those resources are far too costly without insurance coverage,” said Rep. Cartwright. “This common-sense bill supported by both Democrats and Republicans will extend Medicare coverage for prescription hearing aid devices so seniors can access these life-enhancing solutions without breaking their bank.” “I’m thrilled to be co-leading the Help Extend Auditory Relief (HEAR Act) with Representative Cartwright, which would expand Medicare access for millions of Americans, ensuring they have the ability to get the hearing aids they need and deserve,” said Congressman Lawler. “I will never stop fighting for our seniors, those who are disabled, and those who need a helping hand - we are judged by how we treat the most vulnerable in our society, and this bill goes a long way towards helping them.” Elements of this bill were included in the landmark Lower Drug Costs Now Act, passed by the U.S. House in December 2019. The taxpayer savings generated from empowering Medicare to take on big drug companies and negotiate lower prices for Americans on Medicare and private insurance would have been partly reinvested to implement the HEAR Act’s provisions to expand Medicare Part B coverage of  hearing benefits. This legislation is endorsed by the Center for Hearing and Deaf Services, Hearing Loss Association of America, Center for Advocacy for the Rights and Interests of the Elderly (CARIE) and the SeniorLAW Center.  “With one in five Pennsylvanians being over 65 there is growing number of seniors having hearing loss,” said Barbara Kelley, Executive Director of the Hearing Loss Association of America. “Representative Cartwright’s legislation will help people afford hearing aids to stay engaged, active and in many cases, working beyond age 65. Hearing health is part of overall health, and the cost of hearing aids can be a barrier to treatment. This bill will help reduce those barriers.” This legislation is co-sponsored by U.S. Reps. Mike Lawler (R-NY-17), Tony Cardenas (D-CA-29), Madeleine Dean (D-PA-04), Raul Grijalva (D-AZ-03), Betty McCollum (D-MN-04), Mark Takano (D-CA-39) and Mike Thompson (D-CA-05)."

April 19,Kevin Cramer,R,N.D.,Sen. Cramer: National Science Foundation Awards More Than $3.2 Million to North Dakota Tribal Colleges,"WASHINGTON – In response to the recent news that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed into law an inhumane measure banning local governments from requiring employers to institute basic heat protections to protect workers, Representatives Raúl M. Grijalva (AZ-07) and Judy Chu (CA-28) issued the following statement: “The action by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and the Republican state legislature is unconscionable and cruel. Local governments should be able to require employers to provide workers with basic safety measures from scorching temperatures in the workplace. As climate change continues to exacerbate extreme heat, it’s clear that workers in Florida and across the country need guaranteed federal workplace protections from heat, like shade, accessible water, and cooling breaks, now, more than ever,” said Reps. Grijalva and Chu. “As the summer heat quickly approaches, it’s urgent that Speaker Johnson and the Republican majority bring the Asunción Valdivia Heat Illness, Injury and Fatality Prevention Act to the House floor for a vote. This legislation would implement these types of common sense protections to ensure the safety and health of workers who are exposed to dangerous heat conditions in the workplace. We must act now and decisively to safeguard all workers from heat stress and extreme temperatures.” “Americans across the country are grappling with some of the hottest temperatures on record. Yet workers in this country still have no legal protection against excessive heat—one of the oldest, most serious, and most common workplace hazards. Heat illness affects workers in our nation’s fields, warehouses, and factories, and climate change is making the problem more severe every year,” said Ranking Member Bobby Scott, House Committee on Education and the Workforce. “Asunción Valdivia Heat Illness, Injury and Fatality Prevention Act would require OSHA to issue a heat standard on a much faster track than the normal OSHA regulatory process. Workers deserve nothing less, particularly as heat-related illnesses and deaths rise.” The Asunción Valdivia Heat Illness, Injury and Fatality Prevention Act is sponsored by Reps. Raúl M. Grijalva (AZ-07), Judy Chu (CA-28), Bobby Scott (VA-03), and Alma Adams (NC-12) and Senators Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Alex Padilla (D-CA), and Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) in the Senate."

April 17,Susan Collins,R,Me.,Senator Collins Questions U.S. Attorney General on Efforts to Shut Down Illegal Chinese Marijuana Operations in Maine,"April 19, 2024 Amendments to Drastically Increase Humanitarian Assistance, Impose One-Year Moratorium on Offensive Weapons Transfers to IDF WASHINGTON – Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) filed an amendment to increase funding to global humanitarian assistance and an amendment to place a one-year moratorium on the transfer of offensive weapons to the Israeli military. “We find ourselves at a critical inflection point and every action taken by policymakers in this moment must be in pursuit of peace, de-escalation, and saving lives,” said Congresswoman Pressley. “Our amendments would help deliver desperately needed humanitarian assistance and stop the flow of offensive weapons that have been used by the Israeli military to kill Palestinians en masse.” The first amendment filed by Rep. Pressley would drastically increase the amount of humanitarian aid in the bill from $9.1 billion to $26.4 billion. This humanitarian aid would be used to address the worsening crises in Gaza and Ukraine, as well as in Haiti, Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan, and others. The second amendment filed would prevent the United States from sending offensive weapons to the Israeli military for one year. The amendment would allow the United States to continue providing missile defense systems to Israel, including the Iron Dome. The amendment comes amidst rising tensions in the Middle East, over 34,000 Palestinians killed in Gaza, 1,200 Israelis killed in Hamas’s horrific October attack, more than 100 hostages still held captive by Hamas, and millions of Gazans on the brink of famine.   Since the horrific October 7th attack, Congresswoman Pressley has consistently and stridently called for a ceasefire to save lives, return all hostages, and surge humanitarian aid to Gaza. This week, Rep. Pressley delivered a floor speech in which she called or urgent de-escalation in the Middle East and renewed her calls for a ceasefire in Gaza to prevent a broader regional war. As Co-Chair of the House Haiti Caucus, Rep. Pressley has also led calls for extending Temporary Protected Status for Haiti, a halt to deportations, a Haitian-led democratic transition, the delivery of humanitarian, economic and security assistance to the island, and more. Throughout the Israel and Hamas conflict, Rep. Pressley has been a vocal and consistent advocate of diplomacy, de-escalation, and saving lives. ### Washington DC Office 402 Cannon HOB

April 18,Susan Collins,R,Me.,"Senator Collins Welcomes Westbrook High School Students to Washington, D.C.","WASHINGTON – Today, the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs held a markup on the bipartisan Caring for Survivors Act of 2023. The legislation passed out of Subcommittee by voice vote. This legislation is led by Congresswoman Jahana Hayes (CT-05) and Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-01) in the House, and Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Jon Tester (D-Mont) and Senator John Boozman (R-Ark) in the Senate. The Caring for Survivors Act would bring survivor benefits in line with other federal benefits and ensure surviving families get the benefits their loved ones earned. “I am committed to honoring our service members, veterans, and the survivors they have left behind,” said Congresswoman Hayes. “The outdated policies surrounding Dependency and Indemnity Compensation have created unbearable stress for surviving families. The Caring for Survivors Act increases those benefits, reduces barriers to access, and lessens the financial burden placed on veterans, service members, and their families. I am pleased this bill passed out of the Subcommittee today and look forward to action by the full committee. A full committee markup on this bill will allow it to be brought to the House floor for a vote. This issue is too important and we must pursue every opportunity to make this necessary change.”  On April 10, 2024, Congresswoman Hayes testified before the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs highlighting how the Caring for Survivors Act aims to correct administrative barriers that block surviving families from the benefits their loved one earned. Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) is a tax-free monthly benefit paid to eligible survivors of military Servicemembers who died in the line of duty or eligible survivors of Veterans whose death resulted from a service-related injury or disease. To qualify for this benefit, the claimant(s) must be the eligible surviving family member (spouse, child, parent) of a military Servicemember or Veteran who:      DIC benefits rates were set in 1993 and have been minimally adjusted since then. The DIC also has rules that can drastically decrease the benefits to survivors if they remarry or if the period of disability before death was less than 10 years. Other federal survivor programs do not have such stringent rules for decreasing or withholding survivor benefits.  This bill matches DIC benefits to benefits in other federal survivor programs: The Caring for Survivors Act has the support of the following organizations: Tragedy Assistance for Survivors (TAPS), Gold Star Wives (GSW), Military Officers Association (MOAA), Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA), Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), Disabled American Veterans (DAV), National Military Family Association (NMFA).     Permalink: https://hayes.house.gov/2024/4/house-veterans-affairs-subcommittee-advances-hayes-bill-to-expand-benefits-for-surviving-veteran-families"
April 15,Richard Blumenthal,D,Conn.,"Time Change: Blumenthal, Johnson Announce Witnesses to Appear at Hearing on Boeing's Broken Safety Culture","WASHINGTON - Congresswoman Jahana Hayes (CT-05) released the following statement regarding the need to immediately pass a security supplemental bill: “Our allies desperately need our help. If Ukraine falls the United States will undoubtedly be plunged into a global conflict. On February 13, 2024, the Senate passed bipartisan comprehensive national security legislation to help our allies in Ukraine, Israel, and the Indo-Pacific and send critical aid to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. For two months, this legislation has been stalled by House Republicans. In the shadow of Iran’s attacks in Israel this past weekend, House Republicans continue their infighting and lack of action. We have the votes in the House to pass the bipartisan national security supplemental. This Senate passed bill can pass the House and be on the President’s desk within hours. It is a choice and a further delay tactic that Speaker Mike Johnson has not brought the Senate national security package to the House Floor. Speaker Johnson is trying to appease the most extreme members of his conference, at the expense of our global security. The United States cannot and must not abandon our democratic allies. I will exhaust every legislative option to get an aid bill passed. The one person standing in the way is Speaker Johnson. Statements won’t fix this, tweets won’t fix this, interviews won’t fix this, Mike Johnson must bring this bill to the floor so we can pursue the path that will deliver the most immediate aid to our allies and much needed humanitarian assistance.” Permalink: https://hayes.house.gov/2024/4/hayes-statement-on-the-need-to-immediately-pass-a-security-supplemental-bill"
April 15,Richard Blumenthal,D,Conn.,Blumenthal Sponsors Legislation to Prevent Youth Suicide Amid Youth Mental Health Crisis,"Bipartisan Legislation Enhances All Crop Insurance Infrastructure, with a Focus on Specialty Crops Washington, D.C.— U.S. Representative Austin Scott (GA-08), Chairman of the House Agriculture General Farm Commodities, Risk Management, and Credit Subcommittee, Rep. Jimmy Panetta (CA-19) of the Ways & Means Committee, and Rep. Tracey Mann (KS-01), Chairman of the House Agriculture Livestock, Dairy, and Poultry Subcommittee, today introduced the Ensuring Access to Risk Management Act. The legislation corrects a current flaw that cuts risk management delivery funding for specialty crops whenever larger row crops experience higher commodity prices. The legislation also restores the annual inflation adjustment for risk management delivery funding for all crops. The flaw harming specialty crop risk management delivery has been a problem since 2011. The last general inflation adjustment for risk management delivery was in 2015. The FY2022 Agricultural Appropriations Bill included equitable relief for specialty crop risk management delivery for one year. Both the FY2022 and FY2023 Agricultural Appropriations Bills called on the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to provide permanent relief for specialty crop risk management delivery as well as the restoration of the general annual inflation adjustment for all crops, but USDA indicated that legislation is required. “As the Chairman of the Subcommittee with jurisdiction over Federal Crop Insurance, I’m pleased to introduce this legislation to ensure that the infrastructure delivering our farmers and ranchers their most important safety net is on solid ground,” said Rep. Scott. “Agriculture in my state and district is very diverse, and this legislation is designed to ensure that whatever our producers grow, they’re going to get the risk management help they need.” “The current design of our crop insurance system can hurt many specialty crop producers all across the country, including in California’s 19th Congressional District,” said Rep. Panetta.  “Our bipartisan legislation would correct that flaw and provide improved risk management infrastructure when prices fluctuate. This commonsense step to improve this program will help strengthen our farms, the food that they produce, and the families that they support.” “The higher the risk, the higher fall, and the stronger the safety net you need to survive,” said Rep. Mann. “While the federal crop insurance program mitigates risk and helps strengthen that safety net, the program’s administrative and operating costs have not been adjusted for inflation since the 2015 reinsurance year. Since then, inflation hit a forty-year high, and America’s agricultural producers and crop insurance agents are feeling its weight. By establishing a minimum reimbursement rate for administrative and operating expenses and restoring the annual inflation adjustment, this legislation helps Congress further strengthen the agricultural safety net to give farmers, ranchers, and agricultural producers the certainty they deserve.” “A large, bipartisan majority of Congress has twice gone on record in support of the important policies our legislation today advances,” added Rep. Scott. “Reps. Panetta, Mann, and I look forward to working during the Farm Bill process to make these policies a reality for the benefit of the farm and ranch families we serve and for producers across the country.”   The full text of the legislation can be found here.  # # # Permalink: https://austinscott.house.gov/2024/4/representatives-austin-scott-jimmy-panetta-and-tracey-mann-introduce-measure-to-strengthen-crop-insurance-infrastructure"
April 15,Richard Blumenthal,D,Conn.,Blumenthal & Hawley to Hold Oversight Hearing on Election Deepfakes,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger yesterday presented Baron Braswell and Gwendolyn Martinez — the parents of Baron P. “Deuce” Braswell II — with the “Suzanne McDaniel Memorial Award for Public Awareness” for their work to prevent teen violence in Virginia through the “Baron P. ‘Deuce’ Braswell Run Against Teen Violence.” The Baron P. “Deuce” Braswell Run Against Teen Violence — now in its 19th year — honors the memory of Deuce, a Virginia teenager who was murdered in 2006 by a senseless act of teen violence. Created by Martinez and Braswell, the annual event unites families and teenagers to take a stand against violence in Spotsylvania, Fredericksburg, and the greater region. Each year, Baron and Gwen bring together students, parents, teachers, community leaders, elected officials at all levels, and the media to increase awareness, provide more resources, and prevent future loss. To honor their work, Spanberger joined the U.S. Congressional Crime Survivors and Justice Caucus in presenting Martinez and Braswell with this award, which recognizes those who use their voice to promote and bring about change to advance rights, awareness, and services for crime victims. Spanberger’s office nominated them for the award. Click here to watch the full video of Spanberger’s remarks, as well as the award presentation and comments from Martinez and Braswell. “I have the honor of recognizing that this award will go to Baron Braswell and Gwendolyn Martinez for the work that they do to bring attention to the issue of teen violence in our communities. In January of 2006, they lost their beloved son. He was a student athlete. He was an honorable student. Everyone that knew him loved him. He was a vibrant person,” said Spanberger during the ceremony. “After Deuce’s murder at a party, Gwen and Baron chose to make a change in our community — and they started an annual run, where community members are brought together in a beautiful, joyful, athletic event on a September morning in Virginia. We honor his life, people run a beautiful course, and — importantly — members of the community are educated on resources that are available related to preventing teen violence, related to joining in community with one another, and related to mental health and the challenges that face so many of our kids.” Spanberger continued, “They bring us all together in community to honor their son and remember their son. And there’s a scholarship — so that each year a kid from our region can go off to school and know that they are supported not just financially, but also in spirit. So many of our community members join together year after year to celebrate Deuce’s life and honor him — and I’m honored to present this award.” Click here for more information about the Baron P. “Deuce” Braswell Run Against Teen Violence. BACKGROUND The “Suzanne McDaniel Memorial Award for Public Awareness” honors Suzanne McDaniel, one of the first prosecutor-based victim advocates in Texas and in the country. McDaniel created Harris County’s first community interagency council on sexual assault and family violence and the first rape exam protocol for Houston Hospital and Medical Associations. She also formed the Texas Crime Victim Clearinghouse, the first statewide resource in the nation, and helped draft and pass the Texas Crime Victim Bill of Rights, the Texas Crime Victims’ Compensation Act, and the Texas Constitutional Amendment on Crime Victim Rights. McDaniel passed away in May 2012. The U.S. Congressional Crime Survivors and Justice Caucus focuses on elevating the voices of crime victims and survivors within the U.S. Congress in a bipartisan way. Spanberger has previously spoken at the Run Against Teen Violence to show solidarity with Deuce’s family, local leaders, law enforcement, students, and community members. ### Congresswoman: “We Have Too Much Work to Do to Waste Time on Petty Political Games” WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger today released the following statement after voting against U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene’s (R-GA-14) effort to throw the U.S. House of Representatives into chaos. “Since January 2023, this dysfunctional House Republican majority has […] The Common Ground Scorecard Ranked the Congresswoman as Tied for Fourth Place for Most Bipartisan Elected Official in the Country WASHINGTON, D.C. — The nonpartisan Common Ground Committee (CGC) once again ranked U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger as the most bipartisan Member of Congress from Virginia — and gave her the fourth-highest score of any lawmakers in […] Since the Start of 2019, the Congresswoman’s Office Has Returned More Than $38 Million in Backlogged IRS Refunds, Social Security Checks, VA Benefits, & More WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger announced today that her office has now returned more than $38 million in federal casework funds to residents of Virginia’s Seventh District.

April 17,Richard Blumenthal,D,Conn.,Blumenthal & Colleagues Celebrate Supreme Court's Ruling Upholding Educational Benefits for Veterans,"The “Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act” Would Establish New “Digital Skills at Work” Grant Program to Expand Digital Workforce Skills for Americans Seeking Employment or Upskilling Opportunities WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger (D-VA-07), U.S. Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA), and U.S. Representative David Valadao (R-CA-22) today introduced bipartisan, bicameral legislation to expand access to digital skills training for American job seekers. According to the National Skills Coalition and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, 92 percent of today’s jobs require digital skills. Nearly one third of workers do not have the foundational digital skills — such as email, spreadsheets, or data entry — to enter and succeed in today’s workforce. Americans who can qualify for jobs requiring at least one digital skill earn 23 percent more income on average annually. Despite high demand across industries, digital skills training is not currently listed as an allowable use under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), federal legislation enacted to help job seekers access employment, education, training, and support services to succeed in the labor market. Because of this lack of allowance, one-stop workforce development career centers — physical sites within local workforce development areas across the United States where job seekers and employers can access programs, services, and resources — do not offer any digital skills training opportunities. The bipartisan, bicameral Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act would amend WIOA to establish a new “Digital Skills at Work” grant program to expand digital skills training within postsecondary education, adult education, and workforce development systems. This legislation would make specific, targeted investments in digital skills training to help Americans seeking jobs or upskilling opportunities and Americans with barriers to employment learn or build digital skills. Additionally, this bill would advance access to good-paying jobs and support the development of digitally resilient education and workforce systems. “When we help job seekers learn and refine on-the-job skills, we are helping Americans advance their careers and helping businesses hold on to adept and experienced employees. This bipartisan, bicameral legislation would empower states, localities, and local organizations — that are already doing incredible work to support our local workforces — to assist Virginians and Americans across the country in learning and building the industry-specific digital skills that will help them succeed in our 21st century economy,” said Spanberger. “Investments to close the digital skills gap help our workforce and our communities stay competitive and stay ahead, and I’m grateful for the support of Senator Kaine and Congressman Valadao as we work to deliver this support.” “Digital skills can be a gateway to new job opportunities for so many Virginians, especially at a time when I’m hearing from employers across the Commonwealth about how hard they’re working to hire up,” said Kaine. “The Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act would make it easier for people to access high-quality digital training programs to develop or hone those skills. Investing in our workforce is good for our workers, employers, and overall economy, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join us in supporting this bill.” “Ensuring people have the digital skills they need to navigate the modern job market is critical to the strength of our economy,” said Valadao. “When people enter the workforce with the foundational skills they need, it not only eases the burden on employers, but it sets people on a path to success for the rest of their careers. I’m proud to join Rep. Spanberger in introducing this bipartisan legislation that will help better prepare our workforce and strengthen our economy.” The bipartisan, bicameral Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act is endorsed by a number of local Chambers of Commerce, workforce development boards, education systems, and national education and skills training organizations — including the Virginia Chamber of Commerce, Northern Virginia Chamber of Commerce, Prince William Chamber of Commerce, Fredericksburg Regional Chamber of Commerce, Northern Virginia Black Chamber of Commerce, Virginia Minority Chambers, Inc., Virginia Community College System, Bay Consortium Workforce Development Board, National Skills Coalition, Coalition on Adult Basic Education, Hispanic Federation, National Coalition for Literacy, National Digital Inclusion Alliance, NTEN, American Libraries Association, and Third Way. “Digital skills are essential for both employers and employees. As technology continues to evolve, businesses must equip their workforce with the necessary skills to adapt and excel. For the Commonwealth of Virginia and our nation, we must invest in digital skills training, including upskilling and reskilling, to empower them to stay competitive in a rapidly changing digital world,” said Barry DuVal, President & CEO, Virginia Chamber of Commerce “The Northern Virginia Chamber strongly endorses Congresswoman Spanberger and Senator Kaine’s Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act. In the 2023 Virginia General Assembly session the Northern Virginia Chamber was the leading advocate for the Youngkin Administration’s Workforce Consolidation effort. This legislation will build on that effort and ensure that Virginia and the nation’s workforce will have the digital skills needed to be productive in the 21st century economy,” said Julie Coons, President & CEO, Northern Virginia Chamber of Commerce. “Today 92% of jobs require digital skills and currently a third of American workers do not have access to training to participate in today’s economy. We applaud Congresswoman Spanberger, Congressman David Valadao (R-CA) and Senator Tim Kaine for working in a bipartisan fashion to create grant programs for states and localities to help close the gap on these critical skills for today’s workers. We look forward to continuing to work to ensure this legislation is enacted into law.” “The Prince William Chamber of Commerce fully supports upskilling the American workforce,” said Bob Sweeney, President & CEO, Prince William Chamber of Commerce. “The proposed legislation hits the right folks at the right time! It provides an opportunity for ALL to access the essential digital skills required in the high-demand, high-wage sectors like Data Centers, modern manufacturing and other technology jobs.” “The demand for the current digital workforce is high and will only grow in the future,” said Kevin Dillard, Chair of the Board of Directors, Fredericksburg Regional Chamber. “Providing this opportunity to continue to build upon the digital skills of the workforce of today and of the future is paramount.” “The Northern Virginia Black Chamber of Commerce is proud to support the Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act, spearheaded by Congresswoman Spanberger and Senator Kaine and supported by bipartisan leaders including Rep. Valadao. This groundbreaking legislation addresses an urgent need within our workforce, where the digital divide continues to be a barrier to employment, particularly for communities of color, low-income families, and rural populations,” said Samuel Wiggins, Board Chair, Northern Virginia Black Chamber of Commerce. “As a chamber, our mission is to advocate for economic empowerment and to provide opportunities that foster business growth and workforce development among Black entrepreneurs and professionals. By endorsing this bill, which establishes the ‘Digital Skills at Work’ grant program under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, we are helping to ensure that our members and their communities are not left behind in the rapidly evolving digital economy.  The Northern Virginia Black Chamber of Commerce is committed to championing policies that tackle longstanding disparities and actively promote the economic development and success of our region and the entire country.” “Virginia Minority Chambers, Inc., fully endorses the upcoming Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act, introduced by Congresswoman Spanberger and Senator Kaine with bipartisan leaders like Rep. Valadao. This legislation addresses a pressing national issue—a digital skills gap affecting one-third of the US workforce—with a disproportionate impact on minority workers, low-income individuals, and rural residents due to historic underinvestment and structural inequities,” said Tonya Poindexter, Chief Operating Officer, Virginia Minority Chambers, Inc. “By establishing the ‘Digital Skills at Work’ grant program under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, the bill seeks to provide foundational digital skills necessary for success in today’s job market. Virginia Minority Chambers, Inc. appreciates the recognition of this critical need at the federal level and is committed to working with our federal and state partners to enhance both individual economic opportunities, especially in underserved communities, and the overall economic competitiveness of our nation. The passing of this bill is a vital step toward improving employment prospects across the country and ensuring our workforce is equipped to meet the demands of the digital age, particularly for those most affected by existing disparities.” “The introduction of Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act is a groundbreaking achievement for workforce stakeholders across the country. The bill supports National Skills Coalition research that finds that ninety-two percent of today’s jobs require digital skills, but only two thirds of workers have the foundational digital skills they need to succeed in today’s economy,” said Caroline Treschitta, Senior Government Affairs Manager, National Skills Coalition. “The bipartisan Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act addresses the digital skill divide by equipping workers and businesses with the digital training they need to ensure America remains competitive in the global economy.” Specifically, the Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act would: Click here for the full bill text. ### Congresswoman: “We Have Too Much Work to Do to Waste Time on Petty Political Games” WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger today released the following statement after voting against U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene’s (R-GA-14) effort to throw the U.S. House of Representatives into chaos. “Since January 2023, this dysfunctional House Republican majority has […] The Common Ground Scorecard Ranked the Congresswoman as Tied for Fourth Place for Most Bipartisan Elected Official in the Country WASHINGTON, D.C. — The nonpartisan Common Ground Committee (CGC) once again ranked U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger as the most bipartisan Member of Congress from Virginia — and gave her the fourth-highest score of any lawmakers in […] Since the Start of 2019, the Congresswoman’s Office Has Returned More Than $38 Million in Backlogged IRS Refunds, Social Security Checks, VA Benefits, & More WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger announced today that her office has now returned more than $38 million in federal casework funds to residents of Virginia’s Seventh District.

April 17,Jahana Hayes,D,Conn.-5,Hayes Statement on the Need to Immediately Pass a Security Supplemental Bill,"My prayers go out to the Israeli people, particularly 7-year-old Amina al-Hasoni and her family, who are recovering from Iran’s unprecedented attack on Israel this past weekend.  For too long, Iran has been a destabilizing force in the region, sponsoring known terrorist groups such as Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis in Yemen. The swift response led by President Biden in conjunction with our British, Jordanian, and other regional partners saved countless lives and showed that the world is losing its patience with the Iranian regime.   Now, it’s time for the House to act. We must provide our allies in Israel and Ukraine with the military and financial support they need to respond to the threat posed by Iran, its proxies, and Russia, along with desperately needed humanitarian aid for the Palestinians suffering in Gaza. Providing these funds not only helps protect our allies, but also supports America’s interests abroad. I encourage my Republican colleagues to dispense with political gimmicks that do not meet the threat, and bring up the Senate-passed supplemental bill to aid Israel, Ukraine, and other partners in their struggle against our mutual adversaries.

April 17,Austin Scott,R,Ga.-8,"Representatives Austin Scott, Jimmy Panetta, and Tracey Mann Introduce Measure to Strengthen Crop Insurance Infrastructure","Washington, DC – Today, Representatives Scott Peters (CA-50) and Jen Kiggans (R-VA-02) introduced the Smart Ship Repair Act (SSRA) of 2024, a follow-up to Rep. Peters’ SSRA of 2023, which became law last year. The SSRA of 2024 would require the Navy to change its current practice of soliciting ship repair contracts on a coast-wide basis from availabilities longer than ten months to only those that are projected to last more than 18 months. Under current policy, ships homeported in San Diego that need more than ten months to complete their maintenance cycle could be moved to other facilities along the West Coast if those companies provide a more competitive bid to the Navy. This challenges how the San Diego ship repair cluster can recruit and maintain its workforce and invest in its facilities, while also forcing sailors to possibly spend their time ashore away from their families after executing a long deployment at sea.   “San Diego is home to a vibrant ship repair industry that employs over 4,000 workers and supports the Navy’s force posture in the Asia-Pacific,” said Rep. Peters. “This bill will help protect those jobs and support a high quality of life for sailors and their families while also ensuring the Navy can meet its ship repair needs as it prepares for the threats of the future.”   “Since 2014, the Navy’s fleet based in Hampton Roads has decreased from 48 to 28 vessels, resulting in a 30% cut to our Virginia-based ship repair workforce,” said Rep. Kiggans. “One of the best ways we can support our Navy and maintain the strength of our ship repair industry is to ensure our ships are repaired within their homeports. I am proud to join Congressman Peters in introducing the Smart Ship Repair Act of 2024 so we can provide a better quality of life for our servicemembers and preserve the health of our defense industrial base.”   The SSRA of 2024’s limitation on coast-wide repair solicitation only for maintenance periods longer than 18 months will stabilize the workforce and investment challenges currently confronting San Diego’s ship repair cluster, reduce the likelihood of separation for sailors and their families stationed in San Diego, and maintain flexibility for the Navy to utilize market competition to repair its fleet. This bill would also add transparency to the Navy’s ship repair solicitation process by requiring the service to report to Congress on how it estimates costs associated with ship repair.   ""The Port of San Diego Ship Repair Association appreciates legislative efforts to extend the threshold for coast-wide bids to 18 months,” said  Gordon Rutherford, President of the Port of San Diego Ship Repair Association. “This will keep more ship repair work in Navy homeports, specifically San Diego in our case.  We also applaud this action as a way to reduce the stress and burden on Sailors and their families when their ship undergoes extended maintenance.""   ""Austal USA appreciates Congressman Peters continued efforts to support and bring stability to the ship repair industry in San Diego,"" said Larry Ryder, Vice President of Business Development & External Affairs at Austal USA. ""The Smart Ship Repair Act of 2024 will help San Diego continue to provide world class ship repair services to the U.S. Navy and support jobs in San Diego.""   “NASSCO commends Rep. Peters for introducing this bill which will ensure our sailors and their families remain in their home port during important maintenance and repair availabilities,” said Dave Carver, President of General Dynamics NASSCO. “The coastwide extension will not only reduce the costs associated with moving vessels out of their home port, but sends a positive message to shipyards who continually invest in their facilities.”   “BAE Systems appreciates Congressman Peters’ and Congresswoman Kiggans’ leadership on the conduct of U.S Navy ship maintenance,” said Paul Smith, Vice President and General Manager of BAE Systems Ship Repair. “Overall, the Navy’s private sector surface ship maintenance workload is reduced with fewer ships in the fleet. The Smart Ship Repair Act of 2024 will help enhance predictability and stability for repair work that is 18 months or less, a vitally important aspect that allows sailors to remain close to home during that time and preserves shipyard worker jobs in those ports.”   Full text of the legislation can be found here.    ### Permalink: https://scottpeters.house.gov/2024/4/rep-peters-introduces-bill-to-bolster-ship-repair-industry-jobs-and-navy-sailors-wellbeing-in-san-diego"
April 17,Abigail Spanberger,D,Va.-7,Spanberger Honors Baron Braswell & Gwendolyn Martinez at U.S. Capitol for Their Annual “Baron P. ‘Deuce’ Braswell Run Against Teen Violence”,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Congressman Brad Finstad (MN-01) joined Congressman Zach Nunn (IA-03) in introducing the Year-Round E15 Act, bipartisan legislation that would allow for the sale of E15 across eight Midwestern states.  The bipartisan Year-Round E15 Act would extend the Reid vapor pressure (RVP) volatility waiver to ethanol blends above 10 percent to allow for the year-round sale of E15 in Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Minnesota, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin for 2024.   “The ethanol industry is a driving force for southern Minnesota’s economy and provides a cleaner, low-cost energy source for consumers at the pump,” said Rep. Finstad. “Though the EPA recently announced the year-round sale of E15 in the Midwest starting in 2025, farmers, ethanol producers, and Americans' pocketbooks are footing the bill for this multi-year delay. I’m proud to help introduce this legislation which will allow for the sale of E15 this summer.”  “Since day one, I’ve been fighting for year-round E15. Unfortunately, this Administration has repeatedly put America’s producers and families behind as they stubbornly opposed E15, which is good for the economy, good for the climate, and good for families,” said Rep. Nunn. “This bill wouldn’t be necessary if the Administration had just done the right thing to begin with, but this is a critical step to provide certainty for farmers, producers, and families who will benefit from less expensive fuel.”  Background: In April of 2022, eight Midwestern governors submitted a letter urging the Biden Administration to allow year-round sales of E15. Under current law, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is required to act upon this request within 90 days. The EPA waited until March 6, 2023, just days before biofuel producers would have halted production, to issue a waiver for E15 sales for the summer of 2023.  On February 9, 2023, Rep. Finstad pressed the administration for action on year-round E-15, leading a bipartisan group of 31 members of both the Senate and the House of Representatives in sending a letter to EPA and Office of Management and Budget (OMB), urging the agencies to quickly implement their outstanding regulatory action on the request made the previous April.  In December 2023, Congressman Finstad led a bi-partisan letter urging the EPA and the OMB urging the administration to remove the 1-psi volatility waiver for gasoline and ethanol blends, like E15.  This follow-up letter was sent 300 days after Congressman Finstad led a bicameral letter with U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) urging the EPA and the OMB to act on the request made by the Midwestern governors.  On February 22, 2024, the EPA issued its final ruling to allow for the year-round sale of E15 beginning April 28, 2025, a year after the Biden Administration’s initial proposed implementation date of April 28, 2024. By delaying the implementation, the EPA is punishing American families and farmers who have already faced record inflation, skyrocketing fuel prices, and uncertainty in the market due to the Administration’s economic policies.

April 17,Abigail Spanberger,D,Va.-7,MONDAY: Spanberger to Host Virginia-Focused Telephone Town Hall,"For Immediate Release WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Congressman Jamaal Bowman (NY-16) released the following statement in response to the House Republican floor votes on resolutions following the Iranian military attack on Israel and preceding Israeli military assault on an Iranian consulate: “The escalating violence in the region is dangerous and has the potential to become a full scale war. Our top priority should be de-escalating the ongoing conflict and preventing a regional war, not engaging in reckless political theater that will escalate violence, undermine the President’s use of flexibilities in sanctions to conduct diplomacy, and seek to target humanitarian aid and peace advocacy efforts around the world. That is why I’m opposing a series of bills that have been rushed to the floor by Republican warmongers in Congress. Instead, we must move forward and engage with solutions that center peace and our shared humanity.” ### Permalink: https://bowman.house.gov/2024/4/congressman-jamaal-bowman-statement-on-warmongering-house-republican-legislation

Congressman Jamaal Bowman, Ed.D. (NY-16) released the following statement: “I unequivocally condemn the Iranian military’s attack on Israel, just as I condemn the Israeli military attack on the Iranian consulate in Syria ordered by Prime Minister Netanyahu that sparked this dangerous escalation, which is why I voted against H.Res. 1143 today. President Biden has made it clear that he does not support escalating violence in the Middle East, which this resolution will contribute to by supporting further military action. We must do everything in our power to end the ongoing violence, pursue a lasting ceasefire, and save civilian lives. Instead of pushing resolutions that fan the flames of war, Congress should recognize all of the lives that have been lost, both Palestinian and Israeli.

Specifically, they requested an investigation into the charges that have been brought against Minnesota State Trooper Ryan Londregan. As stated in the letter, ""The Federal government has demonstrated its willingness to involve itself in Hennepin County's justice system in the past. Last year the Department of Justice published a report after carrying out an investigation of the Minneapolis Police Department, located in the same county. The developments of this case are concerning and point to a deliberate attempt to use the Hennepin County Attorney's Office to target members of the law enforcement community. We believe that this is a flagrant example of a problem that your committee has been committed to exposing this Congress: the weaponization of government. We respectfully ask that your committee hold a hearing to examine this issue further."" You can read the full letter here.

April 17,Jacky Rosen,D,Nev.,Rosen-Backed Bipartisan Bills to Hold Iran Accountable Advance Out of Committee,"Washington, D.C. - This week, Congresswoman Fischbach (MN-07) introduced H.R. 7983, the Stop Executive Overreach on Trade Agreements Act, which passed through the Ways and Means Committee today with a (25-16) vote. ""The Biden administration has been bypassing Congressional authority and as a result they are making flimsy, band-aid agreements that hurt our economic security, our national security, and the taxpayers' wallets."" said Rep. Fischbach. ""My bill returns authority back to Congress where it belongs. It incentivizes domestic producers, strengthens thoughtful trade partnerships, and saves taxpayers $109 million. I am grateful to my colleagues for supporting this common-sense legislation."" Chairman Jason Smith said, “The Biden Administration must not be allowed to continue sidestepping Congress with fake, ad hoc critical mineral agreements that have no legislative support or enforceability. This legislation stops the executive branch from overstepping and makes clear that the only trade agreements that qualify for the Inflation Reduction Act’s domestic sourcing requirement are those approved by Congress. I am thankful to Rep. Fischbach for introducing this legislation.” You can watch Rep. Fischbach's full opening statement here. Background: The Biden Administration rushed to pass the Inflation Reduction Act and now House Republicans are having to manage the repercussions. This legislation required critical minerals in electric vehicles be sourced domestically or from a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) partner in order to qualify for its generous electric vehicle tax credit. However, the administration has found these requirements too constraining and chosen to bypass Congressional authority. Instead of making thoughtful, enforceable, and Congressionally-ratified trade agreements, they are making short-sighted agreements to cover their short-sighted plan and it is discouraging both domestic development as well as meaningful international partnerships. The Stop Executive Overreach on Trade Agreements Act clearly defines FTA and only allows minerals sourced domestically or by FTA partners to benefit from the tax credit. This will incentivize the mining and processing of critical minerals here at home, open foreign markets to American-made products and U.S. agriculture, and save taxpayers $109 million.    Permalink: https://fischbach.house.gov/2024/4/rep-fischbach-introduces-the-stop-executive-overreach-on-trade-agreements-act 2513 8th Street S Moorhead, MN 56560 Phone: (218) 422-2090 2211 1st Street S Suite 190 Willmar, MN 56201 Phone: (320) 403-6100 1004 Longworth House Office Building Washington, DC 20515 Phone: (202) 225-2165 Fax: (202) 225-1593"
April 17,Jacky Rosen,D,Nev.,"Rosen, Cortez Masto Join Bipartisan Letter Opposing USPS Consolidations, Operational Changes","Washington, D.C. – House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik joined her colleagues to show their unwavering support for our most precious ally Israel following Iran’s unprecedented attacks this weekend. Stefanik highlighted how the world is less safe because of Joe Biden’s weak foreign policy and demanded a return to President Trump’s peace through strength policies for the sake of Israel’s survival, our nation, and the world’s security.  Watch her full remarks below. Find her full remarks below. “Under Joe Biden, the world is less safe.  Since stepping into the Oval Office, Joe Biden’s weak foreign policy has been defined by a steady stream of disastrous decisions and a world in chaos as a result. His desperate policy of appeasement has left our nation and our allies vulnerable to attack. Make no mistake, Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine because Russia feared no reprisal from Joe Biden. Communist China flew a balloon over the United States, and Joe Biden allowed it. And who can forget Joe Biden’s catastrophic and botched Afghanistan withdrawal abandoning American interests in the Middle East and resulting in 13 American lives lost. All under Joe Biden’s watch.  And now Israel, our most precious ally, is in the fight for her very survival, facing an onslaught of attacks on its borders from Hamas and now the unprecedented attack from Iran over the weekend. Russia, Communist China, and Iran have been emboldened by the utter failures of Joe Biden and the Biden Administration. Our enemies do not fear recourse from America because of Joe Biden’s weakness. For the sake of Israel’s survival, our nation, and the world’s security we need to return to President Trump’s peace through strength policies which House Republicans proudly support.” ### Permalink: https://stefanik.house.gov/2024/4/icymi-chairwoman-stefanik-under-joe-biden-the-world-is-less-safe 2211 Rayburn House Office Building Washington, DC 20515 Phone: (202) 225-4611 137 Margaret Street, Suite 100 Plattsburgh, NY 12901 Phone: (518) 561-2324 Fax: (518) 561-2408 330 Ford Street, Suite B8 Ogdensburg, NY 13669 Phone: (315) 541-2670 99 Troy Road, Suite 312 East Greenbush, NY 12061 Phone: (518) 242-4707 Phone: (315) 219-8005"

Secretary Mayorkas alongside President Biden has used nearly every tool at his disposal to engineer the greatest humanitarian and national security catastrophe at our borders in American history.  “Tragically, Senate Democrats don’t believe this catastrophe merits their time or a discussion on the Senate floor. Instead, they’re signaling to millions demanding accountability that the cabinet official directly responsible for this disaster – who has ignored the law and misled Congress repeatedly – is above reproach.

April 19,Jacky Rosen,D,Nev.,"VIDEO: During Senate Hearing, Rosen Sounds Alarm on DACA Renewal Application Wait Times","Washington, D.C. – Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, a senior member of the Education and the Workforce Committee, had multiple rounds of questions for President of Columbia University Dr. Nemat Shafik, Board of Trustees Co-Chairs Claire Shipman and David Greenwald, and Columbia Law School Dean Emeritus and Harvey R. Miller Professor of Law & Economics Professor David Schizer on the presence of anti-Jewish protests on their campus. Stefanik also secured a commitment from President Shafik to remove Joseph Massad as Chair of the Academic Review Committee after Massad described the October 7th attacks on Israel as “astonishing,” “astounding,” and “awesome.”      Watch her full line of questioning here. Read a full transcript of her line of questioning below: Congresswoman Stefanik: Dr. Shafik, you answered one of the questions of our colleagues across the aisle. You said there has been no anti-Jewish protests. Do the other individuals on the panel agree with that? Let’s start with you Professor Schizer. Dean Emeritus and Harvey R. Miller Professor of Law & Economics Professor David Schizer: So I think there have been antisemitic protests, so I would say yes. Congresswoman Stefanik: So you disagree? There have been anti-Jewish protests. Ms. Shipman? Board of Trustees Co-Chair Claire Shipman: I know there have been a number of incidents, especially one at our law school recently that the students were trying to call a protest, but it was an event to harass admitted students who were Jewish and it's outrageous.  Congresswoman Stefanik: So that’s anti-Jewish, so the answer would be yes? Co-Chair Shipman: Yes.  Congresswoman Stefanik: And Mr. Greenwald? Board of Trustees Co-Chair David Greenwald: There have been antisemitic events on campus which I interpret as anti-Jewish. Congresswoman Stefanik: And Dr. Shafik, you realize that at some of these events, the slurs and the chants have been ‘F the Jews,’ ‘death to Jews,’ ‘F Israel,’ ‘no safe place,’ ‘death to the Zionist state,’ ‘Jews out,’ you don't think those are anti-Jewish? President Shafik: Completely anti-Jewish. Completely unacceptable.  Congresswoman Stefanik: So you changed your testimony on that issue as well? So there have been anti-Jewish protests. President Shafik: I didn’t get to finish my sentence. So, what I was going to say was there were protests that were called, that were–  Congresswoman Stefanik: That’s not what you were asked. You were asked were there any anti-Jewish protests and you said ‘No’.  President Shafik: So the protest was not labeled as an anti-Jewish protest. It was labeled as an anti-Israeli government. But antisemitic incidents happened or antisemitic things were said. So I just wanted to finish. Congresswoman Stefanik: I’m not asking what it was labeled. The question wasn’t what it was labeled. It was a Anti-Jewish protest. You agree with that? You change your testimony?  President Shafik: Congresswoman, anti-Jewish things were said at protests, yes.  Congresswoman Stefanik: Thank you for changing your testimony. Another instance when you changed your testimony is: You stated that Professor Massad was no longer Chair. Then you stated he’s under investigation. He is still chair on the website. So, has he been terminated as chair?  President Shafik: Congresswoman, I want to confirm the facts before getting back to you. Congresswoman Stefanik: I know you confirmed that he was under investigation.   President Shafik: Yes, I can confirm that.  Congresswoman Stefanik: Did you confirm he was still the chair?  President Shafik: I need to confirm that with you. I want to – I need to check.  Congresswoman Stefanik: Well, let me ask you this: Will you make the commitment to remove him as chair?  President Shafik: I think that would be – I think I would, yes. Let me come back with yes. But I think I just want to confirm his current status before I reply.  Congresswoman Stefanik: We’ll take that as a yes, that you will confirm that he will no longer be chair.  … Congresswoman Stefanik: Ms. Shipman, was there an effort to get other trustees to sign a letter supporting President Shafik?  Co-Chair Shipman: No.  Congresswoman Stefanik: There was not? Co-Chair Shipman: No. Congresswoman Stefanik: Will you comply with all document requests related to email correspondence regarding any potential letter? Because board members have come forward anonymously to this committee raising the issue of a letter that was circulated that members of the boards did not sign on in support. Are you testifying today under oath you have no knowledge of any draft letter in support of Dr. Shafik? Co-Chair Shipman: No knowledge whatsoever. And my understanding is we are fully complying and ready to give you whatever you need.  Congresswoman Stefanik: Mr. Greenwald, are you aware of any letter that was circulated? Co-Chair David Greenwald: No, that's surprising to me. Congresswoman Stefanik: Professor David, are you aware? Professor David Schizer: Not at all. Congresswoman Stefanik: My final question is: There's been a lot of discussion on Columbia putting out a statement against calling for the genocide of Jews. That statement was put out after the catastrophically, morally repugnant answers by your colleagues from MIT, Penn, and Harvard, correct? That was when you put out that statement after that hearing? Dr. Shafik: Congresswoman, you shed light on an important issue.  Congresswoman Stefanik: I'm just asking you when you put it out. It was after that hearing. Dr. Shafik: It was definitely after it because, frankly, it seemed obvious. Congresswoman Stefanik: You are aware that Congress voted 377 to 44 condemning antisemitism. That is a strong bipartisan vote. Would you support that vote condemning antisemitism? Dr. Shafik: Yes. Congresswoman Stefanik: And you are aware that in that bill, that got 377 Members out of 435 Members of Congress, condemns ‘from the river to the sea’ as antisemitic? Dr. Shafik: Yes, I am aware of that. Congresswoman Stefanik: But you dont believe ‘from the river to the sea’ is antisemitic? Dr. Shafik: We have already issued a statement to our community saying that language is hurtful and we would prefer not to hear it on our campus. Congresswoman Stefanik: You prefer not to hear it, or is there disciplinary action taken against students of those antisemitic statements? I want an answer to that question.  Dr. Shafik: I’m sorry, can you repeat the question? Congresswoman Stefanik: Has there been disciplinary action taken against students who have chanted ‘from the river to the sea’ which you have testified as antisemitic and which Congress has voted that it is antisemitic? Dr. Shafik: We have some disciplinary cases ongoing around that language. We have specified that those kinds of chants should be restricted in terms of where they happen. We are looking at it. We are looking at it.  Permalink: https://stefanik.house.gov/2024/4/icymi-stefanik-secures-columbia-university-president-s-commitment-to-remove-antisemitic-professor-from-leadership-role 2211 Rayburn House Office Building Washington, DC 20515 Phone: (202) 225-4611 137 Margaret Street, Suite 100 Plattsburgh, NY 12901 Phone: (518) 561-2324 Fax: (518) 561-2408 330 Ford Street, Suite B8 Ogdensburg, NY 13669 Phone: (315) 541-2670 99 Troy Road, Suite 312 East Greenbush, NY 12061 Phone: (518) 242-4707 Phone: (315) 219-8005"
April 16,Scott Peters,D,Calif.-50,Rep. Peters' Statement on Iran Attacks and Path Forward on Foreign and Humanitarian Aid,"Washington, D.C.- Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, a Senior Member of the Education and the Workforce Committee, released the following statement on the rampant antisemitism infecting Columbia University and higher education following the inconsistent testimony of the Columbia University leadership and their Board of Trustees. “Today's hearing of Columbia University president and board members epitomizes the failed leadership on ""elite"" college campuses to combat antisemitism and protect Jewish students. From the university president's moral equivocation on antisemitism, to glaringly inconsistent testimony regarding disciplinary action and lack thereof taken against antisemitic students and pro-terrorist faculty, to astonishingly stating that there has been no ""anti-Jewish"" protests on campus only to then acknowledge that ""F-- the Jews"" & ""Death to the Jews"" is in-fact anti-Jewish when she was further pressed.  Interestingly, during a break, the witnesses were overheard discussing how well they thought their testimony was going for Columbia. This arrogance is eerily reminiscent to the previous three university presidents who believed walking out of the hearing that their testimony was acceptable. Columbia is in for a reckoning of accountability. If it takes a member of Congress to force a university president to fire a pro-terrorist, antisemitic faculty chair, then Columbia University leadership is failing Jewish students and its academic mission. No amount of overlawyered, overprepped, and over-consulted testimony is going to cover up for failure to act.” Permalink: https://stefanik.house.gov/2024/4/stefanik-statement-on-columbia-university-s-failure-to-combat-antisemitism-following-the-inconsistent-and-unacceptable-testimony-from-their-campus-leadership 2211 Rayburn House Office Building Washington, DC 20515 Phone: (202) 225-4611 137 Margaret Street, Suite 100 Plattsburgh, NY 12901 Phone: (518) 561-2324 Fax: (518) 561-2408 330 Ford Street, Suite B8 Ogdensburg, NY 13669 Phone: (315) 541-2670 99 Troy Road, Suite 312 East Greenbush, NY 12061 Phone: (518) 242-4707 Phone: (315) 219-8005"
April 17,Scott Peters,D,Calif.-50,"Rep. Peters Introduces Bill to Bolster Ship Repair Industry, Jobs, and Navy Sailors’ Wellbeing in San Diego","Washington, D.C. - Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, a senior member of the Education and the Workforce Committee, had multiple rounds of questions for President of Columbia University Dr. Nemat Shafik and Board of Trustees Co-Chairs Claire Shipman and David Greenwald about Columbia’s failure to adequately respond to the spread of antisemitism on their campus following the terrorist attacks on Israel committed by Hamas terrorists on October 7th.     Watch her full line of questioning here. Read a full transcript of her line of questioning below: Congresswoman Stefanik: I want to follow up on my colleague Rep. Walberg’s question regarding Professor Joseph Massad. So let me be clear, President, that he was spoken to. Who spoke with him? President Shafik: He was spoken to by his Head of Department and his Dean.  Congresswoman Stefanik: And what was he told? President Shafik: I was not in those conversations. I think he was told that that language was unacceptable. Congresswoman Stefanik: But you’re not aware of what he was told? What was he told? President Shafik: That that language was unacceptable. Congresswoman Stefanik: And were there any other enforcement actions taken? Any other disciplinary actions taken?  President Shafik: In his case, he has not repeated anything like that ever since.  Congresswoman Stefanik: Does he need to repeat stating that the massacre of Israeli civilians was ‘awesome’? Does he need to repeat his participation in an unauthorized, pro-Hamas demonstration on April 4th? You know, Professor David Schizer talked about the lack of enforcement. Do you agree that this is an issue with a lack of enforcement when the policy of Columbia specifically stated on April 5th said, ‘I want to make clear that it is absolutely unacceptable for any member of this community to promote the use of terror or violence,’ and yet you have no action? No disciplinary action. Do you agree with how the university has handled this?  President Shafik: Yeah, we have 4,700 faculty at Columbia, most of whom spend all of their time dedicated to teaching their students Congresswoman Stefanik: But I'm talking about the faculty members who are supporting terror and it's not just that case. Let me bring your attention to Mohamed Abdou who was hired after the October 7th terrorist attack against Israel. He, on October 11th, posted: ‘Yes, I'm with Hamas and Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad.’ He also decried false reports accusing Arabs and Muslims of decapitating the heads of children and being rapists. We know that there were decapitations of babies, of innocent Israeli citizens, of seniors, of women, there were rapes and yet Columbia hired this individual as a professor. How did that hiring process work? Were you aware of those statements before the hiring? President Shafik: I share with you your repugnance at those remarks. I completely understand that. On my watch, faculty who make remarks that cross the line in terms of antisemitism, there will be consequences for them. Congresswoman Stefanik: What are the consequences in this case?  President Shafik: I have five cases at the moment who have either been either taken out of the classroom or dismissed.  Congresswoman Stefanik: And is he one of those?  President Shafik: He will never work at Columbia again. Congresswoman Stefanik: So he has been terminated? President Shafik: He has been terminated and not just terminated, but his files will show that he will never work at Columbia again.  Congresswoman Stefanik: So he is currently not employed by Columbia? President Shafik: He is grading his students’ papers and will never teach at Columbia again and that will be on his permanent record. Congresswoman Stefanik: How are you changing the hiring processes? Because on your watch, he was hired after he made these statements publicly? How are you ensuring this does not happen with your hiring process going forward? President Shafik: So when we hire people, obviously they have to meet the academic qualifications, but we do an employment check and a criminal record check. We also ask everyone to do an attestation that they have never been accused of discrimination or part of an investigation around harassment or discrimination. And that attestation has to be signed by all new employees.  Congresswoman Stefanik: And it didn’t work in this case.  President Shafik: I think in this case, while he may not have been subject to an investigation on discrimination or found guilty, it has to be found guilty.  Congresswoman Stefanik: But don’t you think it’s a problem when the hiring process of Columbia is hiring someone who makes those statements, and is hiring them after making those statements? President Shafik: I agree with you that I think we need to look at how to toughen up those requirements. We do have a requirement, but I agree with you. I think we need to look at how we can make it more effective.  Congresswoman Stefanik: Let me ask about Professor Katherine Frank from the Columbia Law School who said that ‘all Israeli students who have served in the IDF are dangerous and shouldn’t be on campus.’ What disciplinary action has been taken against that professor?’ President Shafik: I agree with you that those comments are completely unacceptable and discriminatory. Congresswoman Stefanik: But I'm asking you what disciplinary action has been taken. President Shafik: She has been spoken to by very senior person in the administration and she has said that that was not what she intended to say. Congresswoman Stefanik: And has she publicly apologized?  President Shafik: I have suggested that. I think she will be finding a way to clarify her position. Congresswoman Stefanik: You see the concern here though, with the lack of enforcement. You see the concern that speaking to these professors is not enough and it's sending a message across the university that this is tolerated. These antisemitic statements from a position of authority in professors in the classroom is tolerated. My time has expired, but I will have multiple rounds with questions. … Congresswoman Stefanik: Just to follow up, you should know this President Shafik, but Massad is still in fact listed on the Columbia website as Chair of the Academic Review Committee. Are you aware of that?  President Shafik: I would need to check that.  Congresswoman Stefanik: The website’s right here. So he hasn't been removed as Chair? Do you have my commitment that he'll be removed as Chair today?  President Shafik: I have my commitment that I will come back to you and give you the facts.  Congresswoman Stefanik: So he hasn't been removed. So you said in front of Congress, under oath, that he was removed.  President Shafik: No, I said I am not sure. I need to check. Congresswoman Stefanik: Well, I'll tell you what he's still listed as chair. Let me ask the Board of Trustees. Is that acceptable that he's chair of this committee? Should he be removed today, Ms. Shipman? Columbia University Board of Trustees Co-Chair Claire Shipman: Congresswoman, you've put your finger on one of the hardest issues we as board chairs face right now. I think you can see our systems from the videos you played, everything you're talking about, our systems of rules and enforcement… Congresswoman Stefanik: Are broken, they're broken. My question to you, Ms. Shipman, and I'm the one asking the questions here as the United States Member of Congress, is: Do you believe that he should be removed as chair because currently he's listed as chair on Columbia University's website? Co-Chair Shipman: I don't believe any professor at Columbia should say anything like, our professors have to be held to a higher standard than our students. And I can tell you that our board–  Congresswoman Stefanik: But you can't say at this hearing that he should be removed as chair even though he violates university rules?  Co-Chair Shipman: I personally don’t want him as chair and we are looking at the issue of faculty and what we expect from our faculty.  Congresswoman Stefanik: Mr. Greenwald, do you think he should be removed as chair? Columbia University Board of Trustees Co-Chair David Greenwald: His comments are abhorrent and I believe that one of the steps that we could take in terms of discipline is to remove him from that leadership position. Congresswoman Stefanik: Thank you for that direct answer. And just to let you know, Mr. Abdou is not grading papers right now. He's on campus at the unsanctioned anti-Israel, antisemitic event that is being supported by pro-Hamas activists on campus. So that's what Professor Abdou is doing at this very moment.

April 18,Brad Finstad,R,Minn.-1,Finstad Helps Introduce Legislation Implementing the Year-Round Sale of E15,"Washington, D.C. – House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik joined House Committee on Education and the Workforce Chairwoman Foxx and students from Columbia University ahead of today’s hearing with Columbia University President Minouche Shafik about the rise in antisemitic attacks at the university and Columbia’s failure to keep members of its Jewish community safe since the horrific October 7th Hamas terrorist attacks against Israel. Stefanik highlighted how today’s hearing is an important step towards transparency and holding Columbia University's leadership accountable for their failure to combat antisemitism on their campus and their failure to protect Jewish students.      Watch her full interview here. Find her full remarks below.  “Today, House Republicans led by Chairwoman Foxx will continue our investigation of the heinous scourge of antisemitism running rampant on America's college campuses. A few months ago, when the university presidents of Harvard, Penn, and MIT testified, they made history for their morally bankrupt answers as the most viewed testimony in the history of the United States Congress. And two are now former presidents.  And after billions of views and world outcry, it set off a long overdue earthquake in higher education. The Columbia University President was invited to that hearing but did not attend. Today, the Columbia President will appear in front of the Education and Workforce Committee along with board of trustee leaders, and we will hold them accountable for their failure to combat antisemitism on their campus and their failure to protect Jewish students. For over 200 years, Columbia University has held the same motto “in thy light shall we see light”. Taken from Psalms, Columbia claims to work in God’s light. Sadly, for all the Jewish students on their campus, this could not be further from the truth. Fueled by hatred and ignorance, unchecked antisemitism has become commonplace on Columbia’s campus: Nazi-era antisemitic propaganda litters the grounds, Swastikas graffiti school property, and mobs assaulting Jewish students, professors openly supporting Hamas and calling for genocide of the Jewish people. Meanwhile, despite claims otherwise, Columbia’s leadership refuses to enforce their own policies and condemn Jewish hatred on campus creating a breeding ground for antisemitism and a hotbed of support for terrorism from radicalized faculty and students. Just look at the campus reaction following the tragic events of October 7th. Over 150 Columbia faculty justified the terrorist attack on Israel resulting in the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust. A Columbia Professor penned an article glorifying Hamas, and anti-Israel student groups invited known members of a terrorist group to speak in support of the terrorist slaughter.  This hearing is an important step towards transparency and accountability in Chairwoman Foxx’s investigation and in our oversight of the failure of colleges and universities to condemn and combat antisemitism and their failure to protect Jewish students.  Before our hearing, we wanted to make sure America hears the firsthand experiences directly from Jewish students studying at Columbia. We are joined today by Eden Yadegar, a junior at Columbia University, and Yola Ashkenazie, a senior at Barnard College.""

April 16,Jamaal Bowman,D,N.Y.-16,Congressman Jamaal Bowman Statement On Warmongering House Republican Legislation,"Washington, D.C. – House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik joined Mornings With Maria to discuss today’s House Committee on Education and the Workforce hearing with Columbia University President Minouche Shafik about the rise in antisemitic attacks at the university and Columbia’s failure to keep members of its Jewish community safe since the horrific October 7th Hamas terrorist attacks against Israel.     Watch her full interview here.   View highlights of her interview below: On The Rampant Antisemitism Happening On Columbia University’s Campus:  Well, first of all, it's important for the viewers to know that the Columbia President was in fact invited when we had that historic hearing with Harvard, MIT, and Penn, and she did not attend that hearing. So as she looks at the past couple of months as the earthquake and the reckoning, and those two presidents became former presidents, there's been clearly a lot of preparation. She hired PR consultants, various attorneys, to prepare today's testimony that's not going to cover-up for the failure of Columbia University to fail to protect Jewish students. They have tolerated and allowed professors who have antisemitic, consistent remarks targeting Jewish students. It includes assault. They have not ensured that their rules are applied, for example, they have rules when it comes to where student groups can protest and anti Israeli groups are breaking those rules and there's no disciplinary action taken. So we're going to ask those tough questions of this Columbia University professor. But I'll tell you, they're working overtime to try to cover this up. You saw an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal. My question though is, they hired so many PR consultants to help the university presidents, how many people have they hired on campus to combat antisemitism? The answer is zero. And I will hold them accountable. We will hold them accountable. On Calls For The President Of Columbia University To Resign: Well, certainly with her failure to condemn antisemitism, yes. That is going to be exposed in full at this hearing. No matter how much preparation, the facts are there.

April 18,Jamaal Bowman,D,N.Y.-16,Congressman Jamaal Bowman Statement On H.Res. 1143,"Washington, D.C. – In case you missed it, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik wrote the following opinion in North Country Now about her commitment to ensuring Upstate New York and North Country hospitals have the resources necessary to expand access to care throughout the region. Find the full opinion below. North Country Now: Stefanik touts Protecting Rural Access to Care Act By Congresswoman Elise Stefanik During my tenure in Congress, I have strongly advocated for delivering high-quality rural healthcare for our families and seniors. A primary concern not only for my constituents across New York’s 21st Congressional District, but for millions of Americans living in rural communities across our country, is access to quality and affordable healthcare. These communities depend on their local hospitals to provide lifesaving care and treatments for their families yet the unique challenges of serving remote areas have led an increasing number of rural hospitals to shut down over the past decade. In fact, according to data from the University of North Carolina’s Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research, 191 rural hospitals have closed or converted to emergency or outpatient care over the last 18 years. These providers face the uniquely difficult task of providing excellent care despite immense financial challenges that have only been exacerbated in recent years. Rising costs paired with low-patient volume and a greater reliance on federal and state funds has led many rural hospitals to struggle to remain financially viable. These barriers led the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to develop several payment program options that allow for higher reimbursements for certain services provided by qualifying rural hospitals. Of the numerous CMS payment programs, the Critical Access Hospital (CAH) designation has proven to be highly effective in reducing the financial vulnerability of rural hospitals and increasing access to care throughout medically underserved regions. CAHs receive higher reimbursements for their Medicare services provided, allowing them to remain open and keep essential healthcare services in rural communities. Across NY-21, Lewis County General Hospital, Carthage Area Hospital, River Hospital, University of Vermont Health Network - Elizabethtown and Alice Hyde Medical Center, Clifton-Fine Hospital, Massena Hospital, and Gouverneur Hospital all maintain a CAH designation. I have long since advocated for the CAH designation as I understand its importance to hospitals across my district. In January 2021, I recognized an error in CMS’s certification policy that unjustly narrowed the eligibility criteria for hospitals to certify or recertify as a CAH. In response, I authored the bipartisan Protecting Rural Access to Care Act to protect hospitals at risk of losing their designation. Then in June 2021, I called on CMS to reverse this harmful policy and brought this concern to the Department of Health and Human Services on behalf of vulnerable hospitals at risk of losing their CAH statuses. I was proud to see that following my advocacy CMS decided to reverse its disastrous policy and as a result, Carthage Area Hospital in NY-21 was able to maintain its designation. Not only did my critical legislation and constant pressure force CMS to reverse course and allow Carthage Area Hospital to keep its CAH status, but it also opened the door for other hospitals across the region to qualify as well. I was pleased to see that in November 2023, Alice Hyde Medical Center of Malone received their CAH designation as a direct result of my efforts as well. I also sent a letter of support to CMS on behalf of Massena Hospital in December 2023 and I am happy to report that they were recently granted their CAH status as a result. My office is supporting other hospitals in the region as they navigate the application process with CMS and I look forward to continuing to advocate on their behalf. As the representative for NY-21, I remain steadfast in my commitment to ensuring our hospitals have the resources necessary to expand access to care throughout Upstate New York and the North Country.

April 16,Michelle Fischbach,R,Minn.-7,MN Republicans request House Judiciary hold hearing to investigate Hennepin County Attorney's office,"Washington, D.C. - Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik co-led the introduction of the bipartisan Blast Overpressure Safety Act with Congressman Ro Khanna (D-CA) to better mitigate and protect service members from blast overpressure and traumatic brain injuries (TBI) they may be exposed to in the line of duty. “As the Chief advocate for Fort Drum in Congress the safety and security of the 10th Mountain Division soldiers is one of my top priorities which is why I am proud to co-lead the bipartisan Blast Overpressure Safety Act in the House with Congressman Khanna to protect our brave service members from blast overpressure and TBI,” said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik. “This legislation will ensure soldiers, such as our 10th Mountain Division soldiers who were attacked in Iraq and Syria last year, receive adequate care.”  ""As ranking member of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Cyber, Innovative Technologies, and Information Systems, I’m proud to partner with Congresswoman Elise Stefanik to lead the bipartisan Blast Overpressure Safety Act to protect American service members from the overlooked dangers of traumatic brain injuries and blast overpressure. By improving care, mitigating exposure, and providing greater transparency in our military's equipment procurement process, we can protect the health of the brave men and women who serve our country,” said Congressman Ro Khanna. “Brain health plays a crucial role in many veterans’ overall quality of life. Head-related trauma, including traumatic brain injury (TBI), is sometimes referred to as the ‘signature injury’ for post-9/11 veterans due to the increased TBI prevalence among veterans of this generation. Wounded Warrior Project’s (WWP’s) 2022 Annual Warrior Survey found that 36.5% of WWP warriors self-reported experiencing TBI due to military service,” said Jen Silva, Chief Program Officer of the Wounded Warrior Project. “The Blast Overpressure Safety Act will help protect Service members from blast overpressure and TBI; improve research and data collection regarding brain health and safety; and expand access to effective treatments and support for veterans with a brain injury. WWP supports this bill, and we applaud the representatives for their efforts to address this critical issue.” Specifically, Blast Overpressure Safety Act: Rep. Elise Stefanik and Rep.

April 16,Elise Stefanik,R,N.Y.-21,"ICYMI: Chairwoman Stefanik: “Under Joe Biden, The World Is Less Safe”","Washington, D.C. – At the House Ways and Means Committee hearing on President Biden's trade agenda, Congressman Darin LaHood (IL-16) pressed U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai on the need to address the Administration's lack of leadership on digital trade policy and Brazil's discriminatory tariffs on American ethanol, which continue to harm Illinois farmers and producers. On both digital trade policy and the Brazil ethanol tariff issue, Rep. LaHood has led letters to the Administration pushing them to exert American leadership in the global economy.  LaHood’s questioning can be viewed here or below: In remarks on the Administration’s digital trade position, Rep. LaHood stated: “I am the Co-Chair with Congresswoman DelBene of the Digital Trade Caucus. Many of us on this side of the aisle are exceedingly frustrated with the Administration’s inability to promote a coherent trade agenda. When we think about digital trade, obviously there is growing concern about the Chinese Communist Party’s global economic influence, and their promotion of digital trade policies that run counter to American ideals. These Chinese policies promote censorship and surveillance, encourage human rights abuses, and force unwanted technology transfers through initiatives like the Digital Silk Road.Rather than providing a free-market alternative to the CCP’s digital governance model, this Administration sends mixed messages on the global stage by walking back long-held, bipartisan digital trade proposals outlined at the World Trade Organization without clearly articulating a policy path forward.Last November, Congresswoman DelBene and I co-led a bipartisan letter along with 36 House colleagues to you underscoring how your decision threatens America’s leadership and ultimately harms American businesses and workers. This decision, as we mentioned, was made without any sufficient congressional input."" LaHood went on to question USTR’s actions on the discriminatory tariffs Brazil has placed on American ethanol, saying: “I want to highlight a Bloomberg article that came out last week titled, 'Brazil Rebuffs U.S. Pressure to Abandon Tariffs on Ethanol Imports.' Can you comment on the current negotiations with Brazil? It is immensely frustrating for our ethanol producers in this country. What actions are the Administration going to take?"" ###  Permalink: https://lahood.house.gov/2024/4/lahood-stresses-importance-of-addressing-digital-trade-retreat-and-brazil-s-biofuels-tariffs-at-hearing-with-u-s-trade-representative 1424 Longworth HOB Washington, DC 20515 Phone: (202) 225-6201 Fax: (202) 225-9249 100 NE Monroe Street Room 100 Peoria, IL 61602 Phone: (309) 671-7027 Fax: (309) 671-7309 527 Colman Center Drive Rockford, IL 61108 Phone: (779) 238-4785 108 East Beaufort Street Normal, IL 61761 Phone: (309) 445-8080 1715 North Division Street Suite E Morris, IL 60450"
April 17,Elise Stefanik,R,N.Y.-21,House GOP Leadership Statement on Senate Ignoring Constitutional Duty to Hold Mayorkas Impeachment Trial,"Washington, D.C. – The House Ways and Means Committee yesterday advanced the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) Reform Act, which includes Congressman Darin LaHood’s (IL-16) Digital Trade for Development Act. This forward-looking legislation brings the GSP into the 21st Century economy by promoting economic growth around the world and preventing the proliferation of restrictive digital trade policies. The bill’s inclusion counters China’s growing economic influence in the developing world. In remarks during Committee debate on the General System of Preferences Reform Act, Rep. LaHood stated:  ""I want to commend this body for taking up the important task of renewing and revising the Generalized System of Preferences.The updates that we are considering today will not only promote economic growth around the world but also provide much needed modernization to GSP – America’s oldest trade preference program.I also want to acknowledge Trade Subcommittee Chairman Smith for his leadership and advocacy on both a renewed GSP and on the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill, or MTB.These trade preference programs are vital to promoting American manufacturing and ensuring U.S. global leadership, and it is regrettable that we allowed both programs to expire nearly three and a half years ago.The GSP bill before us today is the first step in getting back on track and I look forward to moving the bill forward and hopefully considering an MTB renewal in the near future as well.I am especially pleased that the GSP renewal bill we are marking up today incorporates my bill, the Digital Trade for Development Act, which will add new criteria for countries seeking beneficiary status to account for digital trade barriers and deter the proliferation of restrictive digital trade policies.It is no secret that China has a goal of challenging America’s leadership in the developing world.As co-chair of the Digital Trade Caucus, I am increasingly concerned by the growing evidence of developing countries enacting similar digital trade policies to China’s restrictive Cybersecurity Law.Updating and reforming the GSP to support sound digital trade policies advances American strategic interests around the world and protects small and medium-sized businesses from these costly and restrictive digital trade regimes.I appreciate the Chairman’s inclusion of my bill in the overarching legislation before us, I look forward to supporting the bill shortly, and I yield back."" Background on the Generalized System of Preferences and the Digital Trade for Development Act:Created by Congress in the 1970s to spur economic development in poor countries through trade, the GSP is a trade program that provides nonreciprocal, duty-free treatment for certain U.S. imports from eligible developing countries. Beneficiary developing countries (BDCs) are selected based on certain mandatory eligibility criteria. The last authorized GSP program expired on December 31, 2020. Today’s renewal legislation would also extend the GSP program through 2030. Evidence suggests that several developing countries are enacting similar digital trade policies to China's restrictive Cybersecurity Law and related measures at the detriment to their own economic interests. These countries benefit from duty-free access to American markets under the GSP while employing digital policies that undermine American values, jobs, and exports. Updating and reforming the GSP to support sound digital trade policies will advance American strategic interests around the world and promote economic development in the developing world.The Digital Trade for Development Act would incorporate digital trade as a statutory consideration in designating beneficiary developing countries (BDCs) under the GSP. The legislation would permit the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) to prevent countries from receiving BDC status if, for example, they restrict the free flow of data or force other restrictive e-commerce policies to the detriment of U.S. strategic interests aimed at technology sectors. ###  Permalink: https://lahood.house.gov/2024/4/lahood-s-digital-trade-for-development-act-passes-ways-and-means-committee-as-part-of-generalized-system-of-preferences-reform-act 1424 Longworth HOB Washington, DC 20515 Phone: (202) 225-6201 Fax: (202) 225-9249 100 NE Monroe Street Room 100 Peoria, IL 61602 Phone: (309) 671-7027 Fax: (309) 671-7309 527 Colman Center Drive Rockford, IL 61108 Phone: (779) 238-4785 108 East Beaufort Street Normal, IL 61761 Phone: (309) 445-8080 1715 North Division Street Suite E Morris, IL 60450"
April 17,Elise Stefanik,R,N.Y.-21,ICYMI: Elise Stefanik named in TIME100 Most Influential People of 2024,"WASHINGTON, DC — U.S. Representatives Jamie Raskin (MD-08), Melanie Stansbury (NM-01),  Ilhan Omar (MN-05), and Senator Richard Blumenthal (CT) today introduced the Judicial Ethics Enforcement Act of 2024 creating an Office of the Inspector General within the judicial branch and empowering the inspector general to conduct investigations of alleged violations of the Code of Conduct for Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States.  “Our people are in uproar over the money that billionaires and big corporations are spending to influence justices on the Supreme Court,” said Rep. Raskin. “Well-funded right-wing networks have poured money into reshaping the Court in their image and for their own purposes. Despite this flagrantly elitist and antidemocratic campaign, the highest court in the land continues to have the lowest ethical standards. This legislation takes a crucial step towards rebuilding the Supreme Court’s tarnished reputation and restoring its lost credibility with the American people. I'm grateful to my colleagues Representatives Stansbury and Omar for working with me to forward this critical effort to establish an Office of the Inspector General within the judicial branch. Thank you to Senator Blumenthal for leading the introduction of companion legislation in the Senate.” “Like every other federal entity, the Judiciary needs an Inspector General to deter and investigate internal wrongdoing — and restore public trust. After years of plummeting public confidence, the Courts need a watchdog to do prompt, impartial investigations of alleged conflicts of interest, improper benefits or other potential wrongdoing. Any ethics rules or code of conduct requires public accountability — otherwise it’s dead letter — as the Inspector General would provide,” said Sen. Blumenthal.  “Americans have lost trust in the Supreme Court,” said Rep. Stansbury. “Strong judicial ethics are critical to a free and democratic society. Safeguarding these fundamentals is necessary to ensuring we restore faith in our democracy and our institutions, and an Inspector General will hold the Justices internally accountable to the highest ethical standards to protect the Court from special interest groups looking to strip Americans of their rights to protect their personal agendas.” “For far too long, the highest court in our land has operated without true oversight,"" said Rep. Ilhan Omar. ""The American people deserve to have faith that the decisions being made by our judicial system are guided by the principles of fairness and the rule of law – not partisan politics or personal conflicts of interest. Our democracy depends on the integrity and impartiality of our judicial system. But in recent years, we've seen growing public mistrust as the Court has become increasingly ideological. This bill sends a clear message that the American people deserve transparency, accountability, and a Supreme Court that upholds the highest standards of ethical conduct.”  Specifically, the Judicial Ethics Enforcement Act of 2024 would: Create an Office of the Inspector General within the Judicial branch. Authorize the Inspector General to conduct investigations of alleged violations of the Code of Conduct for Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States. Authorize the powers and limitations of the Office of the Inspector General when investigating the Court. Structure the duties of the Inspector General which would include conducting and supervising audits and investigations, preventing and detecting waste, fraud, and abuse; and recommending changes in laws or regulations relating to the code of conduct adopted by the Supreme Court. Require the Inspector General to make prompt reports to the Chief Justice and to Congress on matters that may require action by the Chief Justice or Congress. Require the Inspector General to report expeditiously to the Attorney General whenever the Inspector General has reasonable grounds to believe there has been a violation of Federal criminal law.  Require the Inspector General to provide an annual report to both the House of Representatives and the Senate on the results of their investigations. Set appointments, term limits and removals of the inspector general. Provide protection for whistleblowers. Statements of support from organizations endorsing the legislation are below:   “The Supreme Court’s ongoing corruption crisis has undermined its credibility and caused public trust to plummet to record lows. Since the conflicted justices refuse to cut off their cozy relationships with their billionaire buddies, the crisis requires an urgent solution. The Judicial Ethics Enforcement Act is just that,” said Accountable.US President Caroline Ciccone. “Thanks to the strong leadership of Representatives Stansbury, Raskin, Omar, Hank Johnson, and several other original cosponsors, we’re one step closer to ensuring our high court serves everyday Americans — not justices’ wealthy pals and special interests.”  “CPD is proud to endorse the Judicial Ethics Enforcement Act and fight for the checks and balances this nation was founded upon,” said CPD Co-Executive Directors, Analilia Mejia and DaMareo Cooper. “Today’s Supreme Court is controlled by ultraconservative justices buried deep in the pockets of special interest groups committed to stripping our freedoms. It’s high time we held the Court to an ethics code that forces them to act with the fairness their job demands.” “The Supreme Court is in a state of crisis—between the corruption permeating its halls and the attacks on our fundamental freedoms, Americans have lost faith in our highest court,” said Tiffany Muller, President of End Citizens United // Let America Vote Action Fund. “The Judicial Ethics Enforcement Act of 2024 is a necessary step in holding the court accountable and restoring Americans’ confidence in the institution. We thank Congresswoman Stansbury and Senator Blumenthal for their ongoing leadership in the fight to reform the Supreme Court.”  ###    Permalink: https://raskin.house.gov/2024/4/reps-raskin-stansbury-and-omar-push-for-supreme-court-accountability-with-new-legislation"

April 17,Elise Stefanik,R,N.Y.-21,Stefanik Statement On Columbia University's Failure To Combat Antisemitism Following The Inconsistent And Unacceptable Testimony From Their Campus Leadership,"WASHINGTON, D.C.—Today Arizona Congressmen Greg Stanton and Juan Ciscomani introduced the Data for a Secured Border Act, bipartisan legislation to improve communication within the Department of Homeland Security and provide Congress with data to better inform decision-making. “To secure our southern border, decision makers need to see the whole picture—clearly and in real time. Our bill will break down bureaucratic silos, and give law enforcement on the frontlines the information they need to do their jobs,” Stanton said.  “In order to effectively address the issues at our southern border, we must have all the proper information and knowledge that is out there. By improving the collection and reporting of border-related metrics, Congress, CBP, and local authorities are able to work more efficiently to find proper solutions to secure our border,” Ciscomani said.  The bill would require DHS to submit a report to Congress on the usefulness of congressionally mandated border security metrics and to evaluate the work done by the Department’s Joint Requirements Council. The bill would also require DHS to make recommendations on updating border security metrics and to address how the JRC assists DHS in disrupting the flow of fentanyl, addressing the backlog of migrant processing, and incorporating technological advances into border management. A one page summary of the bill is HERE. Full text of the bill is HERE.  The legislation is endorsed by the Arizona Narcotic Officer’s Association, the Border Trade Alliance, and Fresh Produce Association of the Americas. “If lawmakers are going to advance policies that will lead to improved border management, then they need timely, reliable data. The Border Trade Alliance applauds Rep. Stanton for prioritizing an enhanced flow of information between DHS and Congress, which will lead to better decision making across government for the border. The BTA is pleased to support the bill and we look forward to working with Rep. Stanton to see the bill through to passage,” Britton Mullen, president, Border Trade Alliance, said. “Congressman Stanton’s attention to the workforce needs of U.S. Customs and Border Protection is much appreciated by the many businesses that rely on an efficient and transparent Customs process,” Lance Jungmeyer, President of the Fresh Produce Association of the Americas, said.“There has been much attention to making a secure border, and some of this effort needs to be at the Ports of Entry, where legitimate trade and travel is the driver of state, regional and local economies.” “The Arizona Narcotic Officer’s Association membership is comprised of 600+ law enforcement officers from throughout the State of Arizona. Federal, State and Local Officers meet throughout the year and collaborate on training and information sharing issues. Streamlining information is crucial to getting it correct and making it actionable. Steps in this legislation will go towards those goals, and ultimately allow us to serve our communities.

April 17,Elise Stefanik,R,N.Y.-21,ICYMI: Stefanik: We Will Hold Columbia University Accountable For Their Failure To Combat Antisemitism on Their Campus,"WASHINGTON, DC — Congressmen Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-1) and Jared Golden (ME-2), the bipartisan co-leads of the Defending Borders, Defending Democracies Act, released the following statement as the House begins consideration of a foreign aid package and border security legislation:  “We have for months worked to keep up the pressure on our colleagues to act on foreign aid and the crisis at our Southern border because secure borders, ours and those of our democratic allies, are crucial to the defense of democracy against foreign actors hostile to America — whether they are Mexican drug cartels, Hamas terrorists, or dictators and autocrats in Iran, Russia, and China,” the Congressmen said.  “Since we introduced the Defending Borders, Defending Democracies Act in February, that pressure has resulted in appropriations to deploy the largest Border Patrol workforce our country has ever seen, hire new CBP officers to stop the flow of fentanyl from Mexico that is killing our children, and increase funding for security technology and local law enforcement in border states.  “Now we are on track to score another victory for borders and democracy. The foreign aid supplemental taken up by the House today provides aid for our allies in Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan and includes provisions we have fought for, including identical funding levels, a similar new loan structure for some of the foreign aid and the use of seized Russian assets to offset some of the cost. Its passage will tell the world that the United States will not stand by as dictators, terrorists, and totalitarians seek to expand their influence around the world.  “We will continue to push our colleagues and the president to take commonsense actions to secure the border, such as Congress reinstating Title 42-like expulsion authority and the president using his existing power to reinstate the Remain in Mexico policy. Today’s introduction on the House floor of the End the Border Catastrophe Act helps maintain momentum for real action from Congress and the president.” Permalink: https://fitzpatrick.house.gov/2024/4/fitzpatrick-golden-statement-on-speaker-johnson-s-foreign-aid-border-security-effort"
April 17,Elise Stefanik,R,N.Y.-21,ICYMI: Stefanik: Columbia University Is Working Overtime To Cover-up Their Failure To Combat Antisemitism On Campus & House Republicans Will Hold Them Accountable,"WASHINGTON, DC – Representatives Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-1), Chris Pappas (NH-1), Dan Kildee (MI-18), and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (NY) re-introduced the bipartisan, bicameral Clean Water Standards for PFAS Act. This legislation requires EPA to develop water criteria for PFAS under the Clean Water Act and provides EPA with an ambitious yet achievable roadmap to establish effluent limitations guidelines (ELGs) and standards for eight priority industry categories for all measurable PFAS or classes of PFAS within three years. The bill also includes significant federal support to assist communities in upgrading their municipal water infrastructure in order to safeguard public health and protect ratepayers. “Congress must do everything it can to set and enforce criteria to keep PFAS (per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances) chemicals out of Americans’ drinking water,” said Congressional PFAS Task Force Co-Chair Congressman Fitzpatrick. “I am proud to join Reps. Pappas and Kildee and Sen. Gillibrand in introducing the Clean Water Standards for PFAS Act to improve water quality, prevent the leakage of these ‘forever chemicals’ and ensure that our drinking water will be safe for every generation to come.” ""The dangers posed by ‘forever chemicals’ like PFAS remain one of the most pressing environmental and public health issues of our time,"" said Congressman Chris Pappas. “The Clean Water Standards for PFAS Act will finally take action to hold polluters accountable, establish proactive limits for PFAS, set water quality criteria, and support communities with contaminated water. No industry should be given a free pass to poison our water, no community should bear the burden of addressing this challenge alone, and no family should ever have to wonder whether their drinking water is safe when they turn on the tap. I am proud to re-introduce this legislation today, and I will keep fighting to protect our water until it is enacted into law."" ""Access to safe, affordable drinking water should be a right, not a privilege,"" said Congressman Kildee. ""I’m proud to be introducing this critical bill to hold corporate polluters accountable and protect our communities from dangerous PFAS chemicals. As co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional PFAS Task Force, I will continue working with Republicans and Democrats to protect mid-Michigan families from these toxic chemicals."" “Access to clean water and healthy environments is an essential right that all Americans deserve, yet is actively under threat due to the PFAS contamination crisis,” said Senator Gillibrand. “For decades, thousands of manufacturers have been allowed to legally discharge PFAS, exposing far too many communities across New York State and the country to these toxic chemicals. The Clean Water Standards for PFAS Act would finally address these harmful industrial discharges and complement EPA’s recently announced first-ever national drinking water standard for PFAS. I’m proud to work alongside Representative Pappas on this important bill and will keep fighting to protect the public from dangerous PFAS chemicals.”  “Industries shouldn’t be able to dump as much PFAS as they like into nearby rivers, streams, and lakes, putting the health of their neighbors at risk,” said Melanie Benesh, Vice President for Government Affairs at the Environmental Working Group. “The Clean Water Standards for PFAS Act is a critical piece of legislation that will ensure that the EPA acts quickly to turn off the tap on some of the most notorious PFAS polluting industries.” “NACWA is pleased to support the Clean Water Standards for PFAS Act. This legislation sets timelines and parameters around EPA actions underway to regulate PFAS under the Clean Water Act, including pretreatment standards, effluent limits, and water quality standards. The bill smartly targets industrial PFAS discharges to waterways and industrial discharges to clean water agencies as a key first step - in line with “Polluter Pays” principles. Through public clean water agencies’ pretreatment programs,  these utilities can work with industrial dischargers to implement these limits and protect the environment and public health. The bill also requires EPA to promulgate a final method to measure PFAS in wastewater and other key environmental media – an essential step that utilities need before being required to meet CWA limits. These actions will require significant investment and work by clean water agencies – who are willing to be an equitable part of the solution but are not the source of PFAS. For this reason, the bill’s authorization of $1 billion between Fiscal Years 2024-2028 recognizes the need to ensure ratepayers are not held responsible for industry actions and have the financial support needed to meet the requirements set out in this legislation,” said Adam Krantz, CEO of the National Association of Clean Water Agencies. Specifically, this bill would: Permalink: https://fitzpatrick.house.gov/2024/4/fitzpatrick-pappas-kildee-gillibrand-introduce-bipartisan-bicameral-legislation-to-address-pfas-contamination-and-hold-polluters-accountable"
April 18,Elise Stefanik,R,N.Y.-21,ICYMI: Stefanik Op-ed in North Country Now: Protecting Rural Access to Care Act,"WASHINGTON, DC – Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-1), Brad Wenstrup (OH-2), Mike Carey (OH-15), Ruben Gallego (AZ-3), Lou Correa (CA-46), and Carol Miller (WV-1) introduced H.R. 8059, the U.S. Foreign Trade Zone Parity Act, a bipartisan bill to prevent U.S. trade policy from favoring the foreign e-commerce distribution operations that undermine U.S.-based operations. Current U.S. law allows companies to ship products directly from foreign warehouses to U.S. consumers duty and tax-free (including exemption from additional Section 301 China tariffs) if the products are valued at $800 or less. Retailers and brands located within U.S.-based foreign trade zones (FTZs) are barred from this same duty-free benefit on otherwise identical shipments and face up to a 60% cost disadvantage per shipment. This bill fixes that issue, allowing companies operating in the nearly 300 U.S. based FTZs to utilize de minimis entry procedures, creating parity with foreign distributors. The U.S. Foreign Trade Zone Parity Act complements the Ways and Means Committee’s strong action this week to crack down on China’s de minimis abuses by making products subject to the Section 301 tariffs ineligible for de minimis entry. “E-commerce shipments from outside the United States should not be afforded special treatment compared to shipments from inside the U.S.,” said Congressman Fitzpatrick.  “I’m proud to co-sponsor this bipartisan legislation that would create parity in U.S. trade laws and preserve the jobs of hardworking Americans.” ""Our current trade policy counterintuitively benefits adversaries like China, and causes the loss of American jobs and opportunity. I believe it's important for our trade and foreign policy to align; and I'm pleased that my colleagues, both Democrat and Republican, have joined me on this bill to ensure our trade policy doesn't punish U.S. businesses operating within the U.S.,"" said Congressman Wenstrup. “For nearly a century, U.S. Foreign Trade Zones have supported American jobs, improved trade and lessened our dependence on foreign adversaries. However, it’s time we update our trade rules for a 21st century economy. I’m proud to join Representative Wenstrup in this effort to keep America competitive,” said Congressman Carey. “Foreign Trade Zones are vital to the strength of our supply chain and for supporting U.S. jobs,” said Congressman Gallego. “I am proud to back this bill to finally bring parity to FTZs, ease supply chain burdens, and keep our economy moving.” ""The National Association of Foreign-Trade Zones (NAFTZ) is grateful for the introduction of the bipartisan U.S. Foreign Trade Zone Parity Act of 2024 (H.R. 8059) led by Representatives Brad Wenstrup (R-OH) and co-sponsored by Lou Correa (D-CA), Carol Miller (R-WV), Ruben Gallego (D-AZ), Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA), and Mike Carey (R-OH). The legislation will level the playing field for U.S.-based operations distributing from an FTZ and ensure retention of American jobs while spurring further economic growth within the boundaries of the United States. Congressman Wenstrup’s bill eliminates the existing incentive to establish or relocate operations across the border, resulting in no change to the volume of de minimis trade, only where those transactions originate and extends that parity to operations under the oversight of two distinct federal agencies. We recognize the on-going dialogue associated with de minimis entry and this legislation is intended solely to provide parity to U.S. FTZs based on whatever action Congress ultimately takes where de minimis is concerned,"" said Jeff Tafel, President, the National Association of Foreign-Trade Zones.

April 18,Elise Stefanik,R,N.Y.-21,"Stefanik, Khanna Introduce the Blast Overpressure Safety Act"," Washington, D.C. - Today, Congressman Tom Emmer (MN-06) joined Representatives Fischbach (MN-07), Stauber (MN-08), and Finstad (MN-01) in sending a letter to Governor Walz regarding Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty's abuse of her position to wrongfully charge State Patrol Trooper Ryan Londregan and making him aware that the delegation is requesting the House Judiciary Committee investigate the prosecution. The full letter can be read here and below: Dear Governor Walz,We write to you today to express our outrage at the ongoing prosecution of State Trooper Ryan Londregan, and the continued attack on law enforcement officers. We also write to inform you that we will be requesting the House Judiciary Committee conduct an investigation on this matter. Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty has weaponized her position against law enforcement. She ignored an independent use-of-force expert chosen by her own office, who stated that Trooper Londregan acted as a “reasonable officer” would have. The fact that Trooper Londregan is still being charged with second-degree murder, along with other charges, after this statement from the prosecution’s own expert can lead us to only one conclusion; this prosecution is politically motivated.We’ve seen the tragic consequences of the denigration of this noble profession. In 2023, 378 officers were shot in the line of duty, the highest number since the Fraternal Order of Police began collecting this data. Too many of these deaths hit close to home here in Minnesota. The split second that officers have to make life-and-death decisions has often been clouded by the fear of political persecution, like what is happening to Trooper Londregan right now. Enough is enough. The uncertainty that this frivolous case puts in officers' minds could cost them their lives.It is time for us as a nation to stop demonizing law enforcement. It is time for you to remove this case from the Hennepin County Attorney’s office. It is time for you to listen to Minnesota’s law enforcement community and ensure that Trooper Londregan is treated fairly under the law. Respectfully, Congressman Tom Emmer Congresswoman Michelle Fischbach Congressman Pete Stauber Congressman Brad Finstad  Background  State Trooper Londregan was charged with felony counts of second-degree unintentional murder, first-degree assault, and second-degree manslaughter after he shot and killed Ricky Cobb II. An expert concluded Trooper Londregan followed his training and acted lawfully to save his partner's life. Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty ignored this expert in order to advance her politically motivated and unjust prosecution. ### Permalink: https://emmer.house.gov/2024/3/emmer-and-mn-republicans"

Specifically, they request an investigation into the charges that have been brought against Minnesota State Trooper Ryan Londregan.  As stated in the letter, ""The Federal government has demonstrated its willingness to involve itself in Hennepin County's justice system in the past. Last year the Department of Justice published a report after carrying out an investigation of the Minneapolis Police Department, located in the same county. The developments of this case are concerning and point to a deliberate attempt to use the Hennepin County Attorney's Office to target members of the law enforcement community. We believe that this is a flagrant example of a problem that your committee has been committed to exposing this Congress: the weaponization of government. We respectfully ask that your committee hold a hearing to examine this issue further.""  You can read the full letter here.   Background  The delegation sent a letter to Governor Walz regarding Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty's abuse of power and making him aware they would request this of the House Judiciary Committee.

April 17,Darin M. LaHood,R,Ill.-16,LaHood Stresses Importance of Addressing Digital Trade Retreat and Brazil's Biofuels Tariffs at Hearing with U.S. Trade Representative," Washington, D.C. – Today, in an effort to bolster America’s national security, Congressman Tom Emmer (MN-06) introduced the Ammunition Supply Chain Act. The legislation aims to ensure the resilience and efficiency of our nation’s ammunition manufacturing supply chain. Senator Jim Risch (R-ID) introduced companion legislation in the United States Senate.  The Ammunition Supply Chain Act requires the Secretary of the Army to provide a comprehensive report to Congress on the supply chain of ammunition manufacturing. The report will include information on sourcing raw materials used in ammunition production, examining weaknesses in the existing supply chain and the global demand for ammunition, and providing strategies for fostering public-private partnerships.  “As threats to our nation’s security evolve, it is more important than ever to take proactive measures to secure our ammunition supply chain. This is not only about enhancing our military readiness but also supporting American manufacturing and ensuring law-abiding Minnesotans and Americans can exercise their Second Amendment rights,” Congressman Emmer said.   ""This administration creates as many ridiculous hurdles as possible to restrict law-abiding gun owners’ access to affordable guns and ammunition,” said Senator Risch. “The Ammunition Supply Chain Act forces transparency from the Biden administration about the status of our domestic ammunition supply chain. This is vital to protect our right to bear arms and to ensure our military has the ammunition it needs to protect our country.”   Background Due to a rise in the use of ammunition and artillery in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, countries around the world are battling shortages of key materials needed for ammunition production, resulting in domestic ammunition prices skyrocketing, limiting millions of Americans’ ability to exercise their Second Amendment rights. Congressman Emmer has consistently championed and defended American’s Second Amendment rights. He recently introduced legislation to provide recourse for law-abiding Americans who were improperly denied the ability to legally purchase a firearm. Furthermore, Emmer staunchly opposed the Biden Administration’s crackdowns on stabilizing braces in 2023.  The Ammunition Supply Chain Act is cosponsored by Representatives Pete Stauber, Brad Finstad, Michelle Fischbach, Rick Crawford and Bruce Westerman.  The legislation is supported by the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) and Vista Outdoor.

April 16,Shelley Moore Capito,R,W.Va.,Capito Announces Federal Resources for Initiatives Across West VirginiaRead More,"On April 13, the Iranian regime carried out a massive, unprecedented attack against Israel using drones, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles. I’m glad the attack was largely thwarted, but I can’t imagine how terrifying it must have been for Israeli families. I will continue to keep them in my prayers during these dangerous times. While the Iranian regime has previously relied on its network of terror groups to attack Israel, this was the first time it has carried out a strike from its own soil against our most important ally in the Middle East. And it’s no coincidence that the attack occurred at a time when Israel’s support from the Biden administration is waning and after years of failed policies that have emboldened Iran.  There is no question in my mind that this attack would not have happened if former President Donald Trump was in office. Under Trump, the U.S. was feared by our enemies and respected by our allies. The Trump administration’s maximum pressure campaign against Iran was incredibly effective, whether it was scrapping the Iran Nuclear Deal, hitting Iran in its pocketbook with tough sanctions, or greenlighting a precision air strike to take out Iranian Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani – the leader of the regime’s worldwide terrorist efforts. Unfortunately, Biden scrapped Trump’s maximum pressure campaign and replaced it with policies that have only emboldened Iran. It’s not just Biden’s policies that have emboldened Iran. It’s also his weak rhetoric and unacceptable criticism of Israel’s handling of its war against evil terrorists. Biden’s so-called warning to Iran just a day before the attack was a single message: ""Don’t."" And in the days following the attack, Biden and world leaders urged Israel to just “take the win” and not retaliate because the strikes caused minimal damage. They have no business dictating the terms of Israel’s response to a direct attack on their nation. And on the evening of April 18, Israel responded appropriately to Iran’s attack by taking out military targets in an effort to defend itself and discourage the regime from carrying out another attack.  What Israel needs right now more than ever is strong support from its allies. But since the October 7th terrorist attack, Washington Democrats have become increasingly critical of Israel and its war against the terrorists who carried out the worst massacre of the Jewish people since the Holocaust. The Left has called on Israel to agree to an immediate ceasefire without conditions for having their hostages returned home. They’ve demanded the U.S. cutoff military aid to Israel. They’ve called on Israel to host new elections in an effort to oust its prime minister. It’s absolutely unacceptable.   House Republicans are fighting back. In direct response to the April 13 attack, we advanced numerous measures to support Israel and hold the evil Iranian regime and its terror proxies accountable. We passed a bill to revoke the tax-exempt status of terrorist-supporting organizations, an effort I’ve helped lead as Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. We also advanced a resolution condemning Iran's attack and reaffirming support for Israel. In addition, the House passed several bills aimed at strengthening sanctions on Iran, the number one state-sponsor of terror in the world.  Israel is one of our strongest allies and closest friends. Whether it’s providing weapons, aid, or intelligence, the U.S. must ensure Israel has the resources it needs to defend itself and keep its people safe. I will ALWAYS stand with Israel, and I will continue pushing this administration to do what’s right and abandon its policies that are emboldening Iran.  "

This legislation prohibits federal funding of NPR and prevents local public radio stations from using federal grant money to purchase content or pay dues to NPR.  “It is bad enough that so many media outlets push their slanted views instead of reporting the news, but it is even more egregious for hardworking taxpayers to be forced to pay for it. National Public Radio has a track record of promoting anti-American narratives on the taxpayer dime,” said Good. “My legislation would ensure no taxpayer dollars are used to fund the woke, leftist propaganda of National Public Radio.”  NPR was originally created to be an educational news source and to “speak with many voices, many dialects.” In the 55 years since NPR was founded, they have become a primary outlet for advancing biased and radical media coverage of political and social issues. On April 10, 2024, former Editor of NPR, Uri Berliner, issued a scathing review of the news outlet claiming it has “lost America’s trust.” Mr. Berliner resigned from NPR shortly after due to a lack of viewpoint diversity and a hard embrace of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) principles.

""This CRA sends a strong rebuke to the CFPB's overreach in its latest ill-conceived rule on credit card late fees,” said Congressman Barr. “In an effort to push a political agenda ahead of the presidential election, the CFPB will harm the very individuals it is tasked to protect by increasing the cost of credit, decreasing the availability of financial products and services, and penalizing consumers who pay their credit card payments on time. Ultimately, this rule will stifle Americans’ economic mobility and prosperity by incentivizing them to take on additional debt, which will lower their credit score, resulting in the reduced possibility of achieving the goal of homeownership, financing a vehicle, or accessing credit for other needs. The Biden administration has shown time and again that they believe debts do not need to be repaid. This CRA will nullify a rule that will result in nothing but bad outcomes for consumers. I look forward to working with Senator Scott to ensure this bill advances through both chambers and is sent to President Biden’s desk.” Watch Congressman Barr’s remarks in support of his CRA here.

April 19,Robert Good,R,Va.-5,Rep. Good Calls for Defunding Biased NPR,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Representative Juan Vargas (CA-52) released the following statement today after American Rivers released its 2024 America’s Most Endangered Rivers report with the Tijuana River listed #9.  “For too long, sewage in the Tijuana River Valley has harmed public health, our local economies, and our ecosystems. This designation reaffirms what our communities already know too well - toxic pollution is flowing into the Tijuana River every day and we need the South Bay International Wastewater Treatment Plant to be expanded as quickly as possible. Recently, the San Diego Congressional delegation secured significant funding that can be used to make improvements to the treatment plant. We’re continuing to push for additional resources and to make sure the country of Mexico does its part as well. Our work is far from over. We’ll keep fighting for the health of our communities and waterways.” The 2024 America’s Most Endangered Rivers report is available here.  In March, the San Diego Congressional delegation announced over $156 million for the U.S. International Boundary Water Commission in the bipartisan government funding bill. The funding can be used for critical repairs to the South Bay International Wastewater Treatment Plant to help combat cross-border pollution.  In 2019, the San Diego Congressional delegation secured $300 million to expand the South Bay International Wastewater Treatment Plant from 25 million gallons per day to 50 million gallons per day. In 2022, the San Diego Congressional delegation successfully passed legislation to clear the path for the International Boundary and Water Commission to use the funds to address harmful pollutants in the Tijuana River Valley.  ###"
Feb. 9,Katie Porter,D,Calif.-47,Roll Call: Katie Porter takes aim at ‘half-baked’ privileged resolutions,"WASHINGTON - At a House Financial Services Committee hearing today, U.S. Representative Juan Vargas (CA-52), co-chair of the Congressional Sustainable Investment Caucus, voiced support for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) recently finalized climate disclosure rule. “The SEC’s climate rule is about standardizing the climate related disclosures publicly traded companies must make so that regular people invested in the market can have access to the same information that businesses already are spending roughly $500,000 a year to access,” said Rep. Vargas. “Giving people more information is a good thing, not a bad thing.” “If you're a teacher, or a firefighter, or anyone that's working to earn a retirement for yourself and your family, because of this rule, you will have more information to help you decide which companies to trust with your hard-earned savings,” Rep. Vargas continued.  Last week, Rep. Vargas held a press conference with Rep. Sean Casten (IL-06) to underscore the need for the SEC’s climate disclosure rule.  Last year, Reps. Vargas and Casten founded the Congressional Sustainable Investment Caucus to create a forum to protect Americans’ freedom to invest while increasing the information available to market participants about the risks posed by climate change. Rep. Vargas’s Corporate Governance Improvement and Investor Protection Act, which passed the House in the 117th Congress, encouraged corporations to address important issues such as climate change and worker rights by requiring the SEC to create standard definitions for environmental and social responsibility metrics. The bill also included language from Rep. Casten’s Climate Risk Disclosure Act that required public companies to disclose additional information about their exposure to climate-related risks.  A rough transcript of Rep. Vargas’s remarks is below.  Rep. Vargas: The SEC’s climate rule is about standardizing the climate related disclosures publicly traded companies must make so that regular people invested in the market can have access to the same information that businesses already are spending roughly $500,000 a year to access. Giving people more information is a good thing, not a bad thing.  The reality is that climate change isn't just a threat to our planet, it's also a threat to our financial systems. Wildfires, floods, and hurricanes, and the risk of future climate disasters have a significant impact on families’ financial well-being. These are not far-left radicals. These are firefighters, these are police officers, these are teachers, these are regular investors, these are… everybody in our country, we want to know this information.  In fact, interestingly, this week, I was able to talk to some insurers, because they are having a difficult time insuring homes in California because of climate change, because of the wildfires. They’re not far-left radicals. These are people that want this information because they invest.  If you're a teacher, or a firefighter, or anyone that's working to earn a retirement for yourself and your family, because of this rule, you will have more information to help you decide which companies to trust with your hard-earned savings.  In issuing this rule, the SEC has remained true to the agency's mission to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets and facilitate capital formation. Climate change also impacts anyone who has money invested in the market, including many, as I said, teachers, firefighters, with a pension, anyone who puts money away for a retirement account.  So I appreciate very much what the SEC has done here. And talking about transparency and talking about giving people the opportunity to take a look at this rule and to comment, it was an enormous amount of time, back and forth. And I think that they did a very good job.  Obviously, there's some of us that wished the rule would have gotten further… Scope Three information. But you know what, I think this is a very good start. So I applaud the SEC. I applaud them for what they've done there. It's clearly within their mandate, clearly opportunity is here to give information to investors that want this information. And I applaud them for what they do.  Lastly, I would say this, there has been this notion of denying climate change for many, many decades. And finally, people are understanding that this is real. It has real impacts on our country and throughout the world.  ###"
April 18,Andy Barr,R,Ky.-6,Barr’s CRA to Nullify Credit Card Late Fee Rule Advances Out of Committee,"   Washington, D.C. (Apr. 17, 2024) –Congresswoman Cori Bush (MO-01), Ayanna Pressley (MA-07), and Katie Porter (CA-47) joined the Community Safety Working Group, a coalition of 70+ organizations with an affirmative vision of public safety, for the launch of the Community Safety Agenda, which includes priority legislation champions affirmative, evidence-based approaches to public safety. “Public safety is public health, and our movement demands transformative changes to our government’s current approach. We need to end the status quo of police brutality and mass incarceration, and channel massive investments into systems of care, not criminalization, that are rooted in improving the safety and well-being of all communities,” said Congresswoman Cori Bush. “One of my greatest privileges continues to be bringing this movement from the streets to the halls of Congress. And that is exactly the intention behind the People’s Response Act. Congress must move to pass this lifesaving legislation.” “The over-criminalization of our K-12 schools is not just an inequity — it is a crisis in and of itself. So we must be intentional about confronting it head on and advancing policies and budgets that promote trauma-informed learning environments where our students can learn free from fear,"" said Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley. ""I'm proud to see critical legislation like the Counseling Not Criminalization in Schools Act gain the support of this broad coalition. Congress must pass this bill and we must continue working to dismantle systems of oppression in America wherever they exist."" “One in five fatal police shootings ends the life of a person with mental illness. This is unacceptable,” said Rep. Katie Porter. “I’m proud that more than 110 of my colleagues are again supporting my bipartisan Mental Health Justice Act, which would provide grants to hire, train, and dispatch mental health responders to people in crisis. Having the right type of responders for mental health emergencies will save lives, make our communities safer, reduce the strain on our criminal justice system, and stop distracting law enforcement from fighting crime. Congress should get this bill across the finish line.” “We are proud to be supporters of the People’s Response Act, which puts humanity first by emphasizing an inclusive, holistic, and health-centered approach to public safety. More police, and more funding for police will not keep our communities safe. Despite the evidence that punitive interventions make us less safe, we continue to see more and more people endorsing stale, old “tough on crime” tactics. It is time to shift this thinking and promote alternatives to law enforcement that are proven to be effective, ” said Michael Huggins, Deputy Senior Director of Policy and Government Affairs at Color Of Change. “As a teacher I wanted what every person wants — to keep their kids safe, their family safe, and their community safe,” said Thea Sebastian, Executive Director of The Futures Institute. “I couldn’t achieve this goal within my classroom. But through this agenda, and alongside the incredible lawmakers and advocates represented here now, I finally have a chance to do so. Over this next year, I look forward to working with all of you — and the more than 90 organizations that have endorsed this agenda and support our Community Safety Working Group — toward making these policy changes a reality, and toward building the new, evidence-based paradigm that will actually keep our kids and communities safe.” Watch the full recording of the press conference HERE. The people who spoke at the press conference, include: Congresswoman Cori Bush (MO-01) Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) Congresswoman Katie Porter (CA-47) Michael Huggins, Color of Change Thea Sebastian, The Futures Institute Rukia Lumumba, Movement For Black Lives  Will Simpson, Equal Justice USA Remarks  Jason Kimelman-Block, Bend the Arc Alex Dilon, March For Our Lives Kelsey Reyes And Ruth Martin, MomsRising  The bills endorsed by the Community Safety Agenda, include, among other things: People's Response Act introduced by Representatives Cori Bush (MO-01), Ayanna Pressley (MA-07), Pramila Jayapal (WA-07), Jan Schakowsky (IL-09), Summer Lee (PA-12), and Morgan McGarvey (KY-03) would create a division on Community Safety within the Department of Health and Human Services that would research and fund life-saving alternatives to incarceration and policing, as well as provide funding opportunities for community-based, non-carceral responses to community safety. Mental Health Justice Act introduced by Representatives Katie Porter (CA-47), Antonio Cárdenas (CA-29), Ayanna Pressley (MA-07), Mary Scanlon (PA-05) and Senator Warren (D-MA) creates a grant program that allows states, tribes, and localities to hire, train, and dispatch mental health professionals to respond to mental health emergencies when 911, 988, or another emergency hotline is called. Opening Doors to Youth Act introduced by Representatives Jesús Garcia (IL-14), Bobby Scott (VA-03), Frederica Wilson (FL-24), and Jahana Hayes (CT-5) establishes and expands youth employment programs through community-based organizations that provide at-risk and opportunity youth with comprehensive pathways to remain connected or reconnect to education and training systems in addition to the supportive services needed to overcome individual barriers to reconnection. Counseling Not Criminalization in Schools Act introduced by Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) and Senator Chris Murphy(D-CT) prohibits federal funds from being used to keep police in schools. Instead, it directs billions towards hiring counselors and support staff, making schools safer and more supportive for all students. As Congress’s first activist from the movement to save Black lives,  Congresswoman Bush has been a fierce advocate for an affirmative, evidence-based approach to public safety. Her flagship bill, the People’s Response Act, is among the legislation that is prioritized in the Community Safety Agenda. Specifically, the People’s Response Act legislation would: Create a Division on Community Safety within HHS to fund, conduct, and coordinate research, technical assistance, and grant programs related to non-carceral, health-centered investments in public safety; Launch a federal first responders unit to support states and local governments with emergency health crises; Promote alternative approaches to public safety, including coordination of research and policies that are being implemented across HHS and other agencies to center health-based and non-carceral responses throughout the federal government; Provide $11 billion in grant funding to state and local governments, as well as community-based organizations, to fully fund public safety and improve crisis response; and Establish a $2.5 billion First Responder Hiring Grant to create thousands of jobs and provide funding to state, local, and tribal governments, as well as community organizations, to hire emergency first responders such as licensed social workers, mental health counselors, substance use counselors, and peer support specialists, in an effort to improve crisis response and increase non-carceral, health-based approaches to public safety.  "
April 16,Thom Tillis,R,N.C.,"Tillis, Colleagues Introduce Legislation to Safeguard Second Amendment Rights and Ensure Accurate Background Checks","Washington D.C. (April 16, 2024) - Today, as House Republicans brought forth yet another messaging bill that fails to address the urgent crisis in the Middle East, Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman (NJ-12) made the following statement on House Resolution 883:  ""Antisemitism is a threat to our communities here and abroad and should be addressed in concrete ways in order to protect our Jewish neighbors. But, continuing to vote on non-binding messaging resolutions to score partisan political points is not a concrete solution and is disrespectful to the seriousness of the situation. ""This resolution inflames tensions when de-escalation must be the goal. As the conflict in the Middle East worsens and the humanitarian need grows every day, Congress must be focused on passing supplemental aid that addresses dire needs, eliminating Hamas, securing safe release of the hostages, and working towards a two-state solution. Aid to Ukraine, Taiwan, suffering Palestinian civilians, and the defense of our ally Israel is paramount. ""Today’s frivolous resolution condemning the phrase 'from the river to the sea' - a phrase already condemned by the House of Representatives - is yet another distraction.  ""The American people don't want to be pulled into a broader regional war; they want us to expand the Child Tax Credit, address gun violence, mental health, climate change, and affordable health care and child care and they deserve a Congress that will deliver on these issues. ""This legislation distracts from the serious business we should be doing and so I voted 'no.'"""
April 18,Lisa Murkowski,R,Alaska,"Alaska Delegation Leads Effort to Delay Alaska Air National Guard Cuts, Protect Defense in the Arctic","WASHINGTON, D.C.– Today, U.S. Representatives Tony Cárdenas, David Trone (D-MD-6), Bruce Westerman (R-AR-4) and Don Bacon (R-NE-2) alongside U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Kevin Cramer (R-ND)reintroduced the bicameral Second Chance Month Resolution. The bicameral, bipartisan effort to designate April 2024 as Second Chance Month serves as reminder of the significant legal and societal barriers for the thousands returning from incarceration each year. In a nation that was founded on new possibilities, this resolution affirms that those who are returning home from jail or prison should have access to rehabilitation, redemption, and the chance to contribute positively to their communities. “Having witnessed firsthand the injustices that countless individuals in my community have faced upon reentry, I’ve made it a priority throughout my years as an elected official to advocate for the resources to make second chances possible,” said Congressman Tony Cárdenas. “In America every person deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, and we must continue to do everything in our power to ensure that people who were formerly incarcerated have access to reentry services and opportunities for a better tomorrow.” ""Second Chance Month is an opportunity to recognize the importance of providing justice-impacted individuals with a real second chance at rebuilding their lives,"" said Congressman David Trone, cofounder, and co-chair of the Second Chance Task Force. ""After decades of overcriminalization, our country must make progress toward putting compassion over confinement. This month — and every month — we recommit ourselves to delivering on this promise.” “Second Chance Month is an important platform to raise awareness of the challenges that formerly incarcerated individuals, who have paid their debt to society, experience in re-entering their communities,” said Congressman Bruce Westerman. “Opportunity after incarceration is critical to breaking the cycle of crime and reducing recidivism. I’m proud to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in this effort to acknowledge that second chances are paramount in fostering safer communities.” “Sadly, many formerly incarcerated individuals return to the prison system because they haven’t been given the opportunity to benefit from rehabilitation, given a chance at a job or training, and have faced scorn from their fellow man,” said Congressman Don Bacon. “The Second Chance Month Resolution highlights the need to focus on opening doors for those who are reentering society, instead of slamming them shut.” “We praise the Senate and House sponsors of the Second Chance Month resolution, which echoes the values shared by Prison Fellowship and the more than 800 churches and partners who believe that Americans with a criminal record can rise from their past, make amends, and reach their God-given potential,” said Heather Rice-Minus, CEO and President of Prison Fellowship. “We support the passing of this resolution and the lawmakers who strive to remove unfair and unnecessary barriers to work, housing, education, and other fundamentals for citizens who have paid their debt to society so they can live lives of productivity and purpose.” Congressman Cárdenas is the founder and chairman of the Youth Justice Caucus, working to support at-risk youth and fix the major problems in the United States juvenile justice system. ###"
April 19,Lisa Murkowski,R,Alaska,"Delegation Slams Biden Decisions to Further Restrict, Deny Resource Development in Alaska","WASHINGTON – Today, Congressman Joaquin Castro (TX-20) released the following statement to celebrate this morning’s announcement that the Library of Congress has selected two songs by artists he nominated – Juan Gabriel’s “Amor Eterno” (1990) and Héctor Lavoe’s “El Cantante” (1978) – for inclusion in the National Recording Registry. “Today’s announcement represents the Library of Congress’ growing recognition that music by Latino musicians has shaped the soundtrack of American life,” said Congressman Joaquin Castro. “Last fall, my office received a record-setting number of public suggestions for Latino songs that spanned styles and eras, and I was proud to nominate titles that represent the diversity of Latino music and sound. For those in my home state of Texas, for example, the choice to honor Juan Gabriel’s ‘Amor Eterno,’ which played at funerals and memorials after the 2019 El Paso shooting, has special meaning. The induction of one’s work into the National Recording Registry represents among the most prestigious honors a musical artist can receive, and today’s inductions are the first songs on the Registry for both Juan Gabriel and Héctor Lavoe. Both musicians were giants of their genres, and I am glad to see their songs preserved for generations to come.” Since it was established by Congress in 2000, the National Recording Registry has worked to preserve recordings with cultural, historic, or aesthetic significance to life in the United States. For the last eighteen years, the Library of Congress has selected 25 recordings for inclusion each year, with works by Latino musicians currently representing less than five percent of inducted titles. Over the last two years, as part of his long-running efforts to improve the recognition of Latino contributions to American history and culture, Congressman Castro has solicited public suggestions for congressional nominations to the National Recording Registry. In his first year of nominations, Congressman Castro received hundreds of public suggestions and submitted 33 titles to the Library of Congress for consideration. The following year, the National Recording Registry inducted two of his nominations – Irene Cara’s “Flashdance…What a Feeling” (1983) and Daddy Yankee’s “Gasolina” (2004), the latter of which made history as the first reggaeton song to be preserved in the registry. In 2023, Congressman Castro received more than 700 suggestions from members of the public and nominated titles by 35 performers – including Juan Gabriel and Héctor Lavoe – for inclusion in this year’s list of inductees. Later this year, Congressman Castro will launch a new call for suggestions to shape his nominations for additions to the National Recording Registry that are expected in 2025."

Discovery, and FOX, seeking more information about the companies’ new joint sports streaming venture (“JV”). The unnamed JV, which was announced in February 2024 and is expected to debut this fall, unites the three most dominant programmers in the sports streaming space, which collectively own the rights to 80 percent of all sports streaming content.  “As programmers, your companies exert tremendous influence over pricing across the live sports TV ecosystem. Upstream, programmers negotiate content licensing deals with sports leagues like the National Football League and the National Basketball Association for the media rights to their sports events. Downstream, programmers determine the terms on which video distributors may license programmers’ sports channels,” the members wrote. “The Joint Venture raises questions about how this new offering would affect access, competition, and choice in the sports streaming market. Without more complete information about the pricing, intent, and organization of this new venture, we are concerned that this consolidation will result in higher prices for consumers and less fair licensing terms for upstream sports leagues and downstream video distributors.” In the letter, the members request a response by April 30. A full copy of the letter can be viewed here. Congressman Joaquin Castro has been a leading congressional voice on antitrust concerns related to the media and entertainment industry.

April 17,John Hoeven,R,N.D.,"Hoeven, Colleagues Urge EPA to Reject California Rule that Would Harm the Rail Industry & American Economy","WASHINGTON – Congressman Joaquin Castro (TX-20), a senior member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Congresswoman Veronica Escobar (TX-16) led 24 of their colleagues last night in a letter to U.S Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, and Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines expressing concerns over the methodology used in National Security Memorandum 20 (NSM 20) to ensure that Israel is using U.S. security assistance in compliance with U.S. and international law. NSM 20 is the White House policy that requires recipients of U.S. assistance to provide written assurances that they will use assistance in compliance with U.S. and international law and facilitate — and not restrict — the delivery of humanitarian aid. NSM 20 additionally establishes new reporting requirements to Congress on these provisions.  “We write to express our deep concern regarding the U.S. Department of State’s recent comments regarding assurances from the Israeli government, under National Security Memorandum (NSM) 20, that the Israeli government is using U.S-origin weapons in full compliance with relevant U.S. and international law and is not restricting the delivery of humanitarian assistance. In the face of mounting credible and deeply troubling reports and allegations that Israel has used U.S arms in ways that violate U.S. and international law, including international humanitarian law as it relates to civilian protections and aid flow, we believe a failure to question, at minimum, the Netanyahu government’s assurances, violates the very spirit of the NSM-20 process,” wrote the lawmakers. “For months, elected representatives, intergovernmental bodies, international courts, Israeli and global human rights observers – along with government officials themselves – have persistently expressed grave concerns regarding the actions of the Netanyahu government,” the lawmakers continued. “These include its conduct throughout the war in Gaza, its policies regarding civilian harm and military targeting, unauthorized expansion of settlements and settler violence in the West Bank and potential use of U.S. arms by settlers in additional to limitations on humanitarian aid supported by the US. We are concerned that some of Israel's actions may not be consistent with international humanitarian law, which the United States has an interest in consistently upholding.  “We remain concerned by the stark differences and gaps in the statements being made by the State Department and White House on how Israel has not been found to be in violation of international humanitarian law, either when it comes to the conduct of the war or when it comes to the provision of humanitarian assistance, which are contradictory to those made by prominent experts and global institutions. Given the dire and catastrophic nature of this war, it is critical to ensure that the U.S. government is fully utilizing the expertise of State Department and DoD officials and legal experts, accounting important intelligence community assessments and data, in thoroughly assessing Israel’s actions in Gaza. Non-political experts’ substantive analysis is vital to ensuring the accuracy and credibility of any and all of the assessments under NSM-20, as well as in the arms transfer review process and security assistance obligation process.”  Today’s letter was sent ahead of the NSM-20 report that is due to Congress on May 8, 2024. In addition to Castro and Escobar, the letter was signed by Representatives Earl Blumenauer (OR-03), Jamaal Bowman (NY-16), Cori Bush (MO-01), André Carson (IN-07), Greg Casar (TX-35), Sean Casten (IL-06), Madeleine Dean (PA-04), Mark DeSaulnier (CA-10), Lloyd Doggett (TX-35), Maxwell Alejandro Frost (FL-10), Jesús “Chuy” García (IL-04), Pramila Jayapal (WA-07), Henry C. “Hank” Johnson, Jr. (GA-04), Stephen Lynch (MA-08), James McGovern (MA-02), Eleanor Holmes Norton (DC-AL), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (NY-14), Ilhan Omar (MN-05), Mark Pocan (WI-02), Ayanna Pressley (MA-07), Delia Ramirez (IL-04), Rashida Tlaib (MI-13), Jill Tokuda (HI-02), and Bonnie Watson Coleman (NJ-12).

April 17,John Hoeven,R,N.D.,"Hoeven Votes to Hold Secretary Mayorkas Accountable for Failure to Uphold the Law, Secure the Border","WASHINGTON – After reports surfaced of lead-tainted applesauce and Lunchables being served to children in Texas and across the country, Congressman Joaquin Castro (TX-20) and 30 members of the Dads Caucus wrote to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) demanding an explanation on how lead-tainted children’s food was allowed to be sold to parents and fed to kids, and to chart a clear path forward to ensure this never happens again. “Alarmingly, this issue was not discovered by the FDA or any other federal oversight agency. The lapse was instead caught after kids started exhibiting symptoms of lead poisoning, and concerned parents and local health officials began looking into possible sources of their illnesses—only to find the culprit in their own pantries,” wrote the members. “Beyond falling short of carrying out the minimum quantity of inspections, the agency has also faltered in its ability to guarantee the quality of these inspections.” The members’ inquiry follows a New York Times investigation on the contamination of certain applesauce products that passed undetected through the import inspection system and resulted in high blood-lead reports in over 500 children in 44 states, as well as recent reports of unacceptable levels of the heavy metal in school-served Lunchables. The Congressional Dads Caucus, founded in January 2023, is a forum for Members of Congress to advocate for legislation that supports working families. Caucus members believe in policy solutions that help working families thrive, including paid family and medical leave policies for all, expanding the Child Tax Credit, increasing access to childcare, and supporting other policies that reduce poverty and ease the burden on working parents. Founding members include Representatives Jimmy Gomez, Rashida Tlaib, Joaquin Castro, Andy Kim, Jamaal Bowman, Rob Menendez, Dan Goldman, Eric Swalwell, Ruben Gallego, Colin Allred, Mike Levin, Josh Harder, and Raul Ruiz. A PDF of the letter can be found HERE and the text is below: Dear Commissioner Califf, We write to you as members of the Congressional Dads Caucus, a diverse group of fathers and mothers who represent districts from across the country and have pledged to advocate for the best interests of all parents and young children. We prioritize policies that uplift and protect all families, from paid leave to affordable and accessible child care for all. Our mission compels us to write to you and express our deep concern regarding the state of children’s food safety in our country, especially considering lead contamination in FDA-approved applesauce last year. We request that the FDA provide us with further information about what the agency is doing to ensure this never happens again and to guarantee food safety for young children. In February, the New York Times reported on the contamination of certain applesauce products that had passed, undetected by inspections or checkpoints, into public consumption. Alarmingly, this issue was not discovered by the FDA or any other federal oversight agency. The lapse was instead caught after kids started exhibiting symptoms of lead poisoning, and concerned parents and local health officials began looking into possible sources of their illnesses—only to find the culprit in their own pantries. Long-term effects of lead toxicity include impairments to the brain and nervous system, and young children undergoing critical mental and physical development are particularly susceptible to lead absorption. Further investigation revealed that lead from lead chromate has been added to ground cinnamon at a plant in Ecuador, likely due to economically motivated adulteration. The contaminated cinnamon then found its way into WanaBana applesauce products and resulted in detrimentally high blood lead levels in hundreds of children across 44 states. The FDA subsequently issued a recall to take these products off the shelves—however, for affected children and families, that change came much too late. In its latest update, the CDC reports over 500 cases across 44 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. More recent news has also highlighted unacceptable levels of the heavy metal in school-served Lunchables, emphasizing the ongoing struggle parents face in keeping their children safe. The current FDA approach to securing food safety operates under the 2011 Food Service Modernization Act (FSMA). Among other mandates, the FSMA requires 19,000 inspections of foreign food manufacturing and processing facilities every year. Only 1,200 such reviews were reported last year. Furthermore, while the FSMA determined that at least 5,000 import investigators should be employed to carry out the required number of inspections, chronic underfunding and staff attrition has resulted in the FDA staffing only 413 investigators. This shortage comes as import volumes increase year by year; last year the agency recorded 15 million lines of food imports. Beyond falling short of carrying out the minimum quantity of inspections, the agency has also faltered in its ability to guarantee the quality of these inspections. Currently the FDA relies on the Foreign Supplier Verification Program (FSVP) to ensure all food imports align with U.S. food standards.  FSVP operates by putting the onus for vetting food on the industry. Manufacturers provide their own framework for assessing their products through a food safety plan and hazard assessment. While the FDA provides draft guidance (i.e., lists lead as a hazardous heavy metal), it does not provide or enforce the assessments themselves. The Congressional Dads Caucus acknowledges the need for more agency resources, but we strongly believe the FDA also needs to be doing more with its existing funding to prevent these devastating lapses in food safety. Thus, we ask that you respond to the following questions and provide us with a better understanding of how your efforts will prevent such dangerous food contamination incidents from occurring again: No family should have to question whether the food eaten by their kids every day will cause them harm—especially when these products have already been stamped with FDA approval. We appreciate your attention to these matters and heightened attention to gaps in our food safety, and we look forward to receiving your response. ###"
April 18,John Hoeven,R,N.D.,Hoeven: BLM’s Public Lands Rule Locks Away Federal Land,"Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Representatives Jared Huffman (CA-02), Grace F. Napolitano (CA-31), Raúl M. Grijalva (AZ-07), and Susie Lee (NV-03) introduced H.R. 7990, the Large-Scale Water Recycling Reauthorization and Investment Act of 2024, to reauthorize a water recycling grant program for large-scale projects in California and the other sixteen western states. “This program for large-scale water recycling and reuse that we secured in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law has been a great success, and we shouldn’t let that progress peter out. Our bill would reauthorize funding for this grant program, help bolster the great projects already underway, and ensure it can continue expanding,” said Rep. Huffman. “I'm glad to join Rep. Napolitano in this effort and am grateful for her leadership in meeting the needs of everyone with a stake in America's water future.” ""Thanks to President Joe Biden, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Camille Calimlim Touton, and our fellow Democrats in Congress, the game-changing Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $450 Million for vital large-scale water recycling projects, including Pure Water and the Hyperion project in Southern California,"" Napolitano said. ""As we combat extreme drought and prepare for future water shortages in the arid West, Congress must provide additional funding opportunities now to help boost these existing large-scale recycling projects and get new ones off the ground. I thank Representatives Grijalva, Huffman, and Lee for their partnership in championing cost-effective, large-scale water recycling projects and further securing a sustainable, drought-proof water supply for our communities."" “The climate crisis is affecting nearly every aspect of our lives, but for those of us who live in the West, the dwindling water supply is often top of mind,” Grijalva said. “This legislation builds on the success of water recycling projects funded by the IIJA and put in place by the Biden administration to provide a sustainable solution that can stretch our water supply for millions of people in the years to come. I want to thank Congresswoman Napolitano for her effective leadership on this legislation and for being a longstanding champion of water supply projects over the years.” “We need to save every drop of water we can to combat one of the worst droughts in the history of the American West,” said Congresswoman Susie Lee. “That’s why I was proud to deliver over $122 million for local water projects last year and why I’m so proud to help lead the reauthorization of the Large-Scale Water Recycling Project Grant Program this year. This critical program was made possible by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that I helped negotiate and pass, and I look forward to seeing it reauthorized for another six years to continue delivering the resources our communities need.” The Large-Scale Water Recycling Reauthorization and Investment Act of 2024, reauthorizes the successful Large-Scale Water Recycling grant program within the Department of the Interior for six years for large-scale water recycling projects that have a total estimated cost of at least $1 Billion. The legislation increases the authorization from $450 Million to $1 Billion for the program; projects must be within one of the Bureau of Reclamation's seventeen western states. The full text of the Large-Scale Water Recycling Reauthorization and Investment Act of 2024 can be viewed HERE."
April 19,John Hoeven,R,N.D.,"Hoeven: President Biden’s Anti-Energy Agenda Hurts U.S. Security, Helps Fund Adversaries Like Iran","Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Representative Jared Huffman (CA-02) along with U.S. Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), and Peter Welch (D-VT), and Member of the European Parliament Mohammed Chahim, led eight other international lawmakers in a letter calling on world leaders to limit plastic producers and other industry officials from unduly influencing efforts by the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee on Plastic Pollution (INC) to combat the scourge of plastic pollution.  Next week, government leaders and international stakeholders will gather for INC-4 in Ottawa, Canada to negotiate the creation of a global plastic pollution treaty. The lawmakers’ letter was addressed to U.S. President Joe Biden, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, United Nations Secretary General António Guterres, and INC Executive Secretary Jyoti Mathur-Filipp.  The letter was also signed by Senators Ben Cardin (D-MD), Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Representatives Adriano Espaillat (NY-13), Eleanor Holmes Norton (DC-01), Seth Magaziner (RI-02), Jan Schakowsky (IL-09), and Melanie Stansbury (NM-01). “Given the great urgency of the plastic crisis, we must unblock the barriers that have kept us from advancing strong global collaboration to combat plastic pollution.  The political influence and obstruction of certain plastic producing industries, petrochemical companies, and other relevant industrial stakeholders has been and remains one of the largest barriers to strong action,” wrote the lawmakers.  “We urge you to institute new policies for corporate and industrial sector representatives participation at negotiating sessions, including requiring participating industries to submit an audited corporate political influencing statement that discloses plastics and climate-related lobbying, campaign contributions, and funding of trade associations and organizations active on plastics and climate issues.  These statements should be reviewed, publicly disclosed, and scrutinized prior to any engagement in INC negotiations.  The INC should also consider additional measures to establish a robust accountability framework to protect against undue influence of corporate actors with proven vested interests that contradict the goals of the global plastics treaty,” added the lawmakers. “These reforms would bring much-needed transparency to industrial plastics-related political influencing activities around the world, and they would help to ensure that the INC process is a good faith effort by countries to solve the plastic pollution crisis,” continued the lawmakers.  The crisis of plastic pollution threatens the planet’s most important natural resources and disproportionately harms vulnerable populations.  About 450,000,000 tons of plastic are produced every year, a number that is projected to triple by 2050.  In the United States, less than 3 percent of plastic waste is recycled into a similar quality product and research shows human beings swallow the amount of plastic in the typical credit card every week. The text of the letter is below and a PDF is available here. Dear President Biden, President von der Leyen, Secretary General Guterres, and Executive Secretary Mathur-Filipp: We, the undersigned Members of the United States Congress and Members of the European Parliament, write to urge you to address the ability of plastic producing corporations and other industry stakeholders that are highly dependent on plastic, particularly single-use, packaging, disposable and non-durable plastics to exert undue influence on efforts by the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee on Plastic Pollution (INC) to develop an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution. Ahead of the upcoming fourth INC negotiating session, enacting policies that call for the disclosure of representatives for plastic producing industries, petrochemical companies, and other relevant industrial stakeholders that are participating in INC meetings will help ensure that science takes precedence in the outcomes of the agreement. We urge you to take immediate steps to monitor and disclose the influence of plastic producing industries, petrochemical companies, and other relevant industrial stakeholders. As national delegations, independent scientists, civil society organizations, Indigenous Peoples, women, and youth work to develop an ambitious treaty that addresses the full life cycle of plastic pollution, we are concerned that certain corporate interests have outsized influence on the negotiations and would seek to limit commitments and responsibilities to proportionately contribute and implement reforms essential to holistically solve the world’s challenge with plastic pollution. As an illustration of how deep inequities in power and access play out in these negotiations, the chemical and fossil fuel representatives registered to attend the third INC negotiating session outnumber officials from Pacific Small Island Developing States by more than two to one and those of the Scientists’ Coalition for an Effective Plastics Treaty by more than three to one.[1] The    143 known fossil fuel and chemical industry lobbyists registered mark a 36% increase from INC- 2 and are a larger group than the number of delegates from the 70 smallest Member States.[2] This overwhelming discrepancy between the number of attendees representing petrochemical industries, which have a vested financial interest in maintaining the status quo, and national and scientific representatives, makes it glaringly obvious how industrial actors’ influence could obstruct meaningful progress. As you know, there is no room for delay to reach an agreement to end the flow of plastics into our environment and commit to a circular economy. To achieve INC’s goal of developing a treaty that addresses the full plastic life cycle, we must acknowledge that plastic pollution begins with fossil fuel extraction. 99% of plastics are produced from fossil fuel-based petrochemicals, which will represent nearly half of oil demand growth by 2050. [3],[4] We cannot recycle our way out of this mess; the U.S. recycling rate stands at a dismal 9%, and less than 10% of all plastic waste generated globally has ever been recycled.[5],[6] Even if we improved our current waste management and recycling systems, not all plastics are recyclable, and some products can only be recycled once or twice.[7] If the new agreement doesn’t adequately address plastic production, particularly the production of single-use and non-durable plastics, no amount of cleanup will protect our environment and health from this crisis. Given the great urgency of the plastic crisis, we must unblock the barriers that have kept us from advancing strong global collaboration to combat plastic pollution. The political influence and obstruction of certain plastic producing industries, petrochemical companies, and other relevant industrial stakeholders has been and remains one of the largest barriers to strong action. Fossil fuel companies and their industry allies have spent billions of dollars lobbying the European Parliament, other European institutions and Member States, the U.S. Congress, and U.S. Executive Branch agencies in order to obstruct or weaken plastics and climate policy for years. Companies attending INC-3 spent more than $85 million on lobbying and political contributions during the 2022 U.S. elections alone.[8] While we acknowledge that engaging with industry can play a role, doing so with industry stakeholders that have consistently engaged in bad faith should be undertaken with extreme caution. A former president of the Plastics Industry Association once said, ""If the public thinks that recycling is working, then they are not going to be as concerned about the environment.""[9] For more than 30 years, the plastics industry has known that recycling is prohibitively expensive and infeasible, yet it spent tens of millions of dollars on ads to deceive the public and place the burden on individual consumers.[10],[11] Today, hundreds of millions of tons of plastic are produced each year and the rate is projected to nearly triple from 2019 levels by 2050.[12] The equivalent of one garbage truck load of plastic is dumped into the oceans every minute, resulting in waste that lingers in our environment, breaking down into ever smaller microplastics. We cannot afford to dump any more.[13] Moreover, plastics account for 3.4% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.[14] As the world shifts away from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy, the world must also move away from plastic. The planet has already warmed over 1.1°C, and every moment of delay makes to the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C that much more difficult.[15] Drastically reducing plastic production and consumption, and eliminating single-use plastics from global commerce, is essential to achieving critical global climate goals. In April, world governments will gather in Ottawa for INC-4, a critical stage to negotiate treaty text and determine its strength. Parties must seize the opportunity to take ambitious and actionable steps to advancing a science and health-outcomes based global framework for addressing plastic pollution and the life-cycle of plastic through the INC decision-making process. We urge you to institute new policies for corporate and industrial sector representatives’ participation at negotiating sessions, including requiring participating industries to submit an audited corporate political influencing statement that discloses plastics and climate-related lobbying, campaign contributions, and funding of trade associations and organizations active on plastics and climate issues. These statements should be reviewed, publicly disclosed, and scrutinized prior to any engagement in INC negotiations. The INC should also consider additional measures to establish a robust accountability framework to protect against undue influence of corporate actors with proven vested interests that contradict the goals of the global plastics treaty. These reforms would bring much-needed transparency to industrial plastics- related political influencing activities around the world, and they would help to ensure that the INC process is a good faith effort by countries to solve the plastic pollution crisis. We note that this is not the first time that many of us have advocated that the United Nations adopt policies that would limit corporate actors with conflicts of interest from obstructing progress. In May and November 2023, many of the undersigned wrote to U.S., EU, UN and United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) leadership calling on them to work together to institute new policies for corporate participation in Conferences of the Parties (COPs) and UNFCCC processes more broadly, including requiring participating companies to submit an audited corporate political influencing statement that discloses climate related lobbying, campaign contributions, and funding of trade associations and organizations active on energy and climate issues.[16],[17] For the past several years, as in INCs, the number of  attendees representing polluting corporate actors at COPs has been larger than the delegations of nearly every country in attendance. Thank you for your attention to this important issue and for your ongoing dedication to building global support for eliminating plastic pollution. We welcome further engagement with you on this topic, and the lead co-signers are available to meet with you at a mutually agreeable time prior to the INC-4 negotiations in April."
April 16,Juan Vargas,D,Calif.-52,Rep. Vargas Statement on the Tijuana River’s Inclusion on the “Most Endangered Rivers” List,"Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Representative Jared Huffman (CA-02) and Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Jeff Merkley (D-OR) re-introduced the Protecting Communities from Plastics Act, legislation that addresses the plastic production crisis that is fueling climate change and worsening environmental injustice. The reintroduction comes just before the 54th annual Earth Day, the official 2024 theme for which is ""Planet vs. Plastics,” as well as the commencement next week of the fourth session of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee to develop an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution in Ottawa. As leaders meet to address the plastic pollution crisis on an international scale, the U.S. must continue to push for stronger legislation at home. “Plastic pollution has become so ubiquitous that it can be found in the deepest parts of our oceans, every corner of the earth, and even in our body tissue. We are at a crisis level, and the problem doesn’t start or end there. Frontline communities are facing the brunt of this massive environmental injustice through the entire plastics lifecycle, from being poisoned by pollution from petrochemical manufacturing process on the front end, to suffering the consequences of toxic waste on the back end,” said Rep. Huffman. “The only way to truly address this crisis is to tackle the problem at its source: reducing how much plastic is produced in the first place and moving our economy away from its overreliance on single-use plastic. The writing is on the wall for Big Oil's waning dirty-energy dominance – and we won’t let them continue their planet-killing pollution with plastics as a safety net.”   “The plastic pollution crisis is an urgent threat to our public and environmental health. Communities living near plastics facilities often suffer from exposure to harmful pollutants and increased long-term health complications,” said Senator Booker. “As we continue to tackle climate change and transition to a clean energy economy, fossil-based plastic production undermines our efforts to reduce our carbon emissions and address environmental injustice. This legislation will create nationwide targets for single-use plastic source reduction and pause the permitting of new and expanded plastics facilities while the EPA makes much-needed regulatory updates.” “When it comes to reducing waste, we are taught the three Rs: reduce, reuse, and recycle. However, the reality for plastics is really the three Bs: buried, burned, or borne out to sea—which means dangerous chemicals are seeping into our soil, air, and water. This is a public health emergency for Americans everywhere, and disproportionately impacts communities of color and low-wealth communities,” said Senator Merkley, who serves as the Chair of the Environment and Public Works subcommittee overseeing environmental justice and chemical safety. “With plastic particles ending up on the snowcaps of the Arctic and inside our own bloodstreams, it’s clear we need strong legislation like the Protecting Communities from Plastics Act to get the plastics crisis under control. I will continue to work alongside my colleagues to get these solutions signed into law.” With plastic production and consumption on track to double in the next decade, the resulting greenhouse gas emissions threaten to put our climate goals further out of reach, while expanded plastic production will drive more pollution in environmental justice communities around the United States. Petrochemical, plastic production, and waste incineration facilities, which are disproportionately located in or near Black, Brown, and low-income communities, release harmful air and water pollution that cause increased incidences of asthma, cancers, endocrine disruption, development disorders, and heart disease. Transitioning off of fossil fuels only to replace that demand with more fossil-based plastic production is not a sustainable solution, and will continue to perpetuate existing climate and environmental justice impacts. The Protecting Communities from Plastics Act would: Rep. Huffman is a leader in Congress on combatting plastic pollution. This March, Huffman and Senator Jeff Merkley (D-OR) sent a letter to encourage U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken to push for decisive measures in addressing plastic production at the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC)’s current session. The lawmakers emphasized the imminent danger plastic poses to public health, national security, and the planet's future throughout its life-cycle and advocated for a vigorous stance in the negotiations. Ahead of next week’s INC4 conference, Huffman joined Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Member of the European Parliament Mohammed Chahim to U.S. President Joe Biden and United Nations officials to ramp up scrutiny of the petrochemical industry’s lobbying at global environmental conferences. Rep. Huffman has repeatedly led letters to the Biden administration to urge greater protections and rules to hold polluting industries accountable, including a letter with both former Rep. Alan Lowenthal and Sen. Cory Booker to the EPA calling on the agency to fully consider climate and environmental justice impacts of chemical recycling, or “advanced recycling” technologies in their rulemaking on those processes. Huffman, along with Merkley, leads the Break Free from Plastic Pollution Act, the most comprehensive plan ever introduced in Congress to address the plastic pollution crisis that is poisoning our air, water, and land, and disproportionately impacting communities of color and low-income Americans. The bill is cosponsored by U.S. Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), and Peter Welch (D-VT) and U.S. Representative Betty McCollum (MN-04).

April 17,Juan Vargas,D,Calif.-52,Rep. Vargas Remarks in Support of SEC Climate Disclosure Rule at House Financial Services Committee Hearing,"Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Representatives Jared Huffman (CA-02) and Diana DeGette (CO-01) applauded the Biden Administration for finalizing the Conservation and Landscape Health rule. “Protecting public lands is so important to my constituents, to Californians, and to the millions of people who treasure the spectacular wild places our country has to offer. But all of those places are at risk from the escalating climate crisis and biodiversity loss,” said Representative Huffman. “Representative DeGette and I have been pushing for BLM to make addressing those crises at the forefront of their latest rulemaking, and I’m grateful to see the finalized rule meets that mark. With this move, the Biden-Harris administration is showing they will stand up for the will of the people and what’s best for the planet – not greedy polluters – so we can preserve public lands for future generations.” “The United States is home to some of the most beautiful landscapes in the world, and these public lands provide recreational opportunities, increase tourism, and support biodiversity. Beyond these impacts, public lands play an important role in mitigating the impact of climate change and improving the health of our planet,” said DeGette. “Today’s final rule is a significant accomplishment for land conservation and wildlife protection, and I am proud that BLM and the Biden Administration are continuing to lead in defending our natural world. Protecting public lands is good public policy, and I have been working in Congress to pass meaningful legislation that conserves public lands in Colorado and throughout the country. I will continue to ensure that even more public lands will be protected and enjoyed for generations to come.” The Conservation and Landscape Health rule provides tools for the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to improve the resilience of public lands in the face of a changing climate and biodiversity loss, conserve important wildlife habitat and intact landscapes, plan for development, and better recognize unique cultural and natural resources on public lands. The announcement from BLM follows sustained efforts by Reps. DeGette and Huffman to urge the Biden Administration to finalize this rule. BLM’s Public Lands Rule is nearly universally popular; a recent analysis found that 92% of public comments submitted on the proposed rule were supportive. The support for the rule reflects a broader sentiment about conservation and public lands among most Americans. In the West, for example, where the vast majority of BLM lands are located, 82% of voters across the political spectrum support a national goal of conserving America’s public lands and waters over the next decade."
April 17,Cori Bush,D,Mo.-1,"Representatives Bush, Pressley, and Porter Join Community Safety Working Group for the Launch of a Community Safety Agenda","Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Representative Jared Huffman (D-San Rafael) and U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-CA) led 19 of their colleagues in an urgent letter to President Joe Biden and Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo calling for them to swiftly declare a federal fishery disaster, joining California Governor Gavin Newsom in his request. This follows the Pacific Fishery Management Council’s stark recommendation to implement a complete closure of California’s commercial and recreational ocean salmon season for the second consecutive year, expected to take effect in May 2024. If granted, the relief would provide necessary assistance for communities grappling with the challenges of the ongoing crisis. “The unprecedented back-to-back closures of the entire California salmon fishery is a devastating crisis. It remains unclear how long the salmon fishery will need to be closed, and we know there is much work ahead of us. The long-term solutions will include improving our drought resiliency, restoring salmon habitat, and of course, addressing the climate crisis. We look forward to continuing our work with your administration on these goals,” the members said in their letter.  “However, Californians who depend on the fishery, and are still trying to recover from last season’s closure, have no time to wait for these long-term objectives to be achieved. A federal fishery disaster declaration will help our commercial and charter fisheries, tribes, and communities survive the difficult times ahead,” the members concluded.  In April 2023, Huffman, Padilla, and Panetta led their colleagues in an urgent letter to President Joe Biden and Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, calling for them to swiftly declare a federal fishery disaster for the 2023 salmon season. Earlier that month, Rep. Huffman held a press conference with Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, Representative Kevin Mullin, and fishing industry stakeholders to call attention to this disaster and highlight the people who will bear the brunt of the impacts of closing the salmon season. In addition to regular engagement with NOAA, Rep. Huffman held a call directly with NOAA Administrator Dr. Rick Spinrad to continue the pressure and encourage him to prompt action. As part of his long-standing efforts to improve disaster relief for fisheries, Congressman Huffman was able to help secure an additional $300 million for fishery disaster declarations Fiscal Year 2023 Omnibus Appropriations bill. Congress also authorized new bipartisan fishery disaster relief language based on Congressman Jared Huffman and Senator Roger Wicker’s Fishery Resource Disasters Improvement Act. This language streamlines the process for declaring a federal fishery disaster and helps to quickly provide relief to affected communities. It also extends eligibility for federal fishery disaster funds not only to commercial fisheries, but also to charter fishing businesses and impacted tribes. In addition to Representative Huffman and Senator Padilla, the letter was signed by Senator Laphonza Butler (D-CA) and Representatives Nanette Barragán (CA-44), Ami Bera (CA-06), Salud Carbajal (CA-24), Jim Costa (CA-21), Mark DeSaulnier (CA-10), Anna Eshoo (CA-16), John Garamendi (CA-08), Josh Harder (CA-09), Sydney Kamlager-Dove (CA-37), Zoe Lofgren (CA-18), Doris Matsui (CA-07), Kevin Mullin (CA-15), Jimmy Panetta (CA-19), Nancy Pelosi (CA-11), Katie Porter (CA-47), Raul Ruiz (CA-25), Eric Swalwell (CA-14), and Mike Thompson (CA-04).

April 16,Bonnie Watson Coleman,D,N.J.-12,Rep. Watson Coleman Statement on Partisan GOP Stunt to Exploit Mid-East Crisis,"Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Representative Jared Huffman (CA-02) and Rosemary Ahtuangaruak, Founder of Grandmothers Growing Goodness and Former Mayor of Nuiqsut, host a virtual press conference to respond to the Department of the Interior’s (DOI) decision regarding their protections for designated Special Areas in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. Speakers discussed the action’s potential to protect the Western Arctic’s indigenous communities from new oil and gas drilling and safeguard the food security, cultural traditions, and health of these vulnerable communities.  Click here to view a recording of the press event Following significant engagement with the public, Alaska Native Tribes, and Alaska Native Corporations, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) finalized the Management and Protection of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska (NPR-A) rule that will ensure maximum protection for significant resource values on the more than 13 million acres of Special Areas in the western Arctic, while supporting subsistence uses and needs for Alaska Native communities. The BLM is also announcing that it will publish a Request for Information in the coming weeks to solicit public comment on whether to consider adding resource values to existing Special Areas, expanding Special Areas, or creating new Special Areas within the NPR-A. Management and Protection of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska Rule Under the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act (NPRPA) of 1976, as amended, Congress directed the BLM to balance oil and gas development with the management and protection of significant resource values in locations known as Special Areas and mitigate impacts of oil and gas activities on surface resources across the reserve. The final rule updates the existing regulatory framework, adopted more than 40 years ago, allowing the BLM to more effectively respond to changing conditions in the NPR-A, while striking a balance between oil and gas development and the management and protection of surface values, including wildlife habitat vital to subsistence. Extending from the northwest slope of the Brooks Range to the Arctic Coast, the NPR-A encompasses roughly 23 million acres of public land managed by the BLM. Tribal Nations have occupied lands now within the NPR-A since time immemorial, and more than 40 Indigenous communities continue to rely on the resources from the Reserve for subsistence, harvesting caribou, shore and waterbirds, and many other fish and wildlife species. Many communities subsist primarily on food that, in turn, relies on the Special Areas of the NPR-A. Natural conditions in the Arctic are changing rapidly due to climate change, which is affecting caribou movement and herd health, causing degradation of permafrost, and altering habitats for wildlife, migratory birds, and native plants throughout the NPR-A. The final rule codifies protections for 13.3 million acres encompassed by the existing Special Areas, limiting future oil and gas leasing and industrial development in the Teshekpuk Lake, Utukok Uplands, Colville River, Kasegaluk Lagoon, and Peard Bay Special Areas – places collectively known for their globally significant intact habitat for wildlife, including grizzly and polar bears, caribou and hundreds of thousands of migratory birds. The rule also codifies existing prohibitions on new leasing in 10.6 million acres, more than 40 percent of the NPR-A, consistent with the current NPR-A Integrated Activity Plan (IAP). Congressman Jared Huffman’s Remarks Thank you, Abby. And hello, everyone. I am Congressman Jared Huffman from the beautiful north coast of California. For those who follow my work in the Congress, you know that I spend a lot of my time working to protect Alaska's wilderness or the people and wildlife that call it home. I want to issue a big thank you to LCV, to Arc Initiatives and everybody joining the call today to talk about this really great news with the unbelievable chaos that Team Extreme, the Republican conference in the House is causing with their limited time in the majority. It sure is nice to be able to celebrate something positive, something meaningful like this in an otherwise dysfunctional Congress. I am a climate hawk, and so what that means is I want to take bold climate action at every opportunity. I'm never going to really be fully satisfied until we get the atmosphere stabilized so that future generations can live on this planet. I won't live to see that. But I want to do as much as I can to put us on that path. And I think we need to give a lot of credit to the Biden administration, the Biden-Harris administration, for the historic climate action that they have made, the progress they made over the past three plus years. Democrats have been working to take actions that previously were unthinkable just a few short years ago when Republicans were screaming from the rooftops that climate change wasn't even real, that we should just drill, baby, drill. I want everyone to really appreciate how big this latest rulemaking from the Department of Interior is. 13 million acres of the Western Arctic now protected. That is record breaking. It is a huge step forward in our ongoing climate and conservation efforts. Not only does it codify existing prohibitions on new leasing in more than 40% of the NPR-A, but it provides greater clarity guidelines to ensure that development protects vital resources for subsistence while honoring existing rights. That's going to help BLM effectively fulfill its obligation to tribal nations. It's hard to find adequate words to describe how special and pristine this place is that we're talking about. The Western Arctic is ground zero for climate change. Every inch of land, water, permafrost holds on to carbon. And so, letting the fossil fuel industry desecrate this place for their dirty energy agenda would wreak absolute havoc on wildlife, native communities, and our climate. These Big Oil barons have tried to find, tried to claim every ounce of oil and gas in the Arctic, regardless of the consequences to our planet and those who live on this land or near this land. And this role is an important step for us to say no, finally, to say no to them, no more plundering our public lands, no more destroying indigenous people's way of life by wringing dry the ecosystems they've relied on since time immemorial. There is still a lot more work that we need to do to protect more of the Western Arctic and to create more permanent protections in other pristine places. We need to continue to put People over Polluters when we make these decisions. But we're fighting back at every turn to protect the Arctic, and we're going to keep doing that. We're going to continue to build on this great progress. And we are making great strides here. So, this is a moment to celebrate and appreciate for sure. More to come. Thank you."

18 Apr.
 WASHINGTON, DC – Today, Congressman Alex X. Mooney reintroduced the Protecting Life in Health Savings Accounts Act (H.R 8049). This legislation would end the preferential tax treatment of abortion by prohibiting the life-taking procedure from being counted as an eligible medical procedure and exclude elective abortions from being paid for out of various types of health savings accounts. Abortion is not health care and should not be considered a medical expense. Seven House Republicans joined the bill as original cosponsors: Reps. Matt Rosendale, Jeff Duncan, Mary Miller, Dan Crenshaw, Paul Gosar, Bob Good, and Daniel Webster. Senator Mike Lee introduced this legislation in the Senate. “The sanctity of life continues to be under assault by President Joe Biden’s Administration. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has made it easier to acquire abortion pills by mail. Post offices are being converted into local abortion clinics. The radical pro-abortion movement is doing anything they can to keep access to abortion as easy and frequent as possible,” said Congressman Alex X. Mooney. “Protecting life is one of my top priorities in Congress. Abortion should not be paid for by the taxpayer and should not hold any special privileges when it comes to tax incentives,” Mooney added. Background: Federal law allows individuals to use tax-advantaged funds in health savings accounts (HSAs), flexible savings accounts (FSAs), health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs), Archer medical savings accounts (MSAs), and retiree health accounts to cover their medical expenses. These accounts allow users to set aside money on a pre-tax basis to pay for qualified medical expenses. These accounts can help pay for deductibles, copays, and medical procedures. Unfortunately, the IRS categorizes elective abortions as an eligible medical expense to be paid using these tax-advantaged savings accounts. The Protecting Life in Health Savings Accounts is the House companion to legislation introduced by Senator Mike Lee of Utah in the United States Senate. Fax: (202) 225-7856"

Warner and Tim Kaine (both D-VA) and Representatives Robert C. “Bobby” Scott (D-VA-03) and Abigail Spanberger (D-VA-07) in calling on the United States Postal Service (USPS) to ensure the efficient and secure delivery of election mail. This letter follows reports that local election officials are advising voters against using USPS to mail in their ballots.  “It is paramount that voters have confidence in USPS to safeguard one of the country’s most fundamental democratic principles. Therefore, we have consistently urged USPS to be more forthcoming and transparent about the steps it is taking to guarantee the timely delivery of mail and packages,” wrote the lawmakers. “Just as we have in the past, we again implore USPS to provide clear guidance and updates to voters regarding the agency’s plan to handle election mail, thereby assuring voters that they can rely on USPS to deliver their ballots securely and punctually.”  Over 2 million Virginians voted absentee in the last general election, and this year’s turnout looks to be similar to or larger. The lawmakers requested that USPS provide information regarding the specific measures and processes it is implementing to facilitate the election mail process.  “USPS needs to provide regular updates and transparency regarding its efforts to address these issues,” continued the lawmakers. “Voters deserve to be informed about actions being taken to safeguard our democracy and ensure that every eligible voter has the opportunity to participate in the electoral process.”  You can read the full letter on election mail concerns  here.

April 19,Rick Scott,R,Fla.,"Sens. Rick Scott, Marco Rubio and Congressman Aaron Bean Introduce Bill to Codify Florida Permitting Program","WASHINGTON, D.C. – Rep. Mark Takano (CA-39), a Congressional leader on LGBTQ and education issues, hailed the finalized rule on Title IX from the U.S. Department of Education and Biden Administration: The Education Department and Biden Administration showed real courage today, delivering on a long-held promise to ensure that the federal government does more to protect all Americans—especially LGBTQ Americans—from discrimination.  This groundbreaking rule is a major victory, but we still have much to do. We need to enshrine and expand its protections by passing the Equality Act because for too many Americans, their rights and protections depend on the zip code they live in.?? Background on Takano: ·         LGBTQ: First openly gay person of color elected to Congress and author of the Equality Act, which would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to extend non-discrimination protections to the LGBTQ community ·         Education: Former teacher and Senior Member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. ###"
April 19,Rick Scott,R,Fla.,"Sen. Rick Scott Releases Spring 2024 Economic Snapshot, Shares Weekly Update on Biden’s Inflation Crisis","Washington, D.C.— Today, Representative Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) released the following statement in response to NASA’s unprecedented cuts to the Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission, led by Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California. “Today’s announcement by NASA confirming dramatic cuts to the Mars Sample Return mission is a disaster for the scientific and space community. NASA's decision displays a troubling indifference towards some of our nation's most brilliant minds and years of innovation to advance this mission. It is particularly alarming that these cuts disproportionately target California’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, an institution at the forefront of numerous scientific breakthroughs. NASA’s ill-considered decision flies in the face of Congressional intent and will result in the loss of hundreds of California jobs. It will also deliver a serious blow to our nation’s leadership in space exploration.”Schiff has continuously opposed the shortsighted budget cuts to the Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission. In November 2023, he and Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) spearheaded a bipartisan, bicameral letter from the California delegation, urging NASA Administrator Bill Nelson to reverse the funding reductions. Following NASA's announcement of federal budget cuts, Schiff issued a statement against the forced reduction of Jet Propulsion Laboratory's (JPL) workforce by 530 employees, which constituted eight percent of its total staff, through layoffs. ###"
April 19,Rick Scott,R,Fla.,"El Senador Rick Scott publica su ‘Panorama Económico Trimestral’, y una actualización semanal sobre la crisis inflacionaria de Biden","Washington, D.C.— Today, Representative Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) joined CNN’s The Lead with Jake Tapper to discuss the need to pass critical foreign aid for U.S. allies Israel, Ukraine, and Taiwan, and the latest in former President Donald Trump’s criminal trials.Watch the full video of the interview HERE.Key Excerpts: On the Need to Pass Crucial Foreign Aid for U.S. Allies, Lack of Effective Governance in the House “We want this place to be governed, and we want it to be governable. We've been demanding for months that we bring up Ukraine funding. Of course, the speaker could have done that months ago. He could have done it, done it separately, like we're doing today. Or it could have brought up the Senate bill. It would have passed overwhelmingly in the House, but nevertheless, we are where we are. “And hopefully this week we'll finally get that aid passed that Ukraine so desperately needs. That we need to send to Israel the humanitarian assistance, as well. As well as aid to Taiwan and our other allies.”On Trump Being in the Defendant’s Chair, Where He Belongs “Well, in terms of, you know, seeing him finally sit in the defendant's chair where I think he belongs, it's been a long time in coming. And it is, you know, I think from the perspective of the justice system, an affirmation that even a former president is not above the law. And ultimately, there is accountability. “But after seeing him successfully delay one proceeding after another after another, literally for years. But then these criminal trials for months and months and months. Finally seeing him face justice in the courtroom, is a long awaited reckoning for the former president. “In terms of whether I would have liked to have seen a different case go forward first. To be candid, yes. I think the most serious and substantial of all the cases is the January 6th federal prosecution. And, you know, there the Justice Department took a long time to get that case investigated to begin with, but nevertheless, the Supreme Court has quite willfully allowed Trump to delay that proceeding by, you know, continuing to sit on its hands when it comes to one of the bogus appeals involving this purported claim of immunity. So there the largest part of the responsibility goes to the court that seems to be doing his will by delaying.” ###"
April 19,Rick Scott,R,Fla.,Sen. Rick Scott Resends Impeachment Articles to Sec. Mayorkas Following Testimony He Did Not Read Them,"Washington, D.C.— Today, Representative Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) joined MSNBC’s José Díaz-Balart to discuss House deliberations around critical aid for Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan, as well as the latest in the jury selection in former President Trump’s New York hush money trial.Watch the full video of the interview HERE.Key Excerpts: On Threats to Democracy at Home and Abroad But what is most important at the end of the day is we need to get this assistance to Ukraine. They are being outgunned. They can't defend themselves. Their democracy as well as ours, is being threatened right now. And we want to make sure that aid gets delivered, as well as the aid to Israel and our other allies. On Donald Trump Not Being Above the Law I'm very impressed that you can have a situation where in a courtroom, in a city in America, 12 ordinary citizens are going to decide whether a former president of the United States is guilty or innocent of charges brought against him. That's a pretty remarkable scene. It's a pretty remarkable… accomplishment for any country and for our democracy that justice is applied to everyone.And the fact that they've gotten through what may be half of the jury selection already, is remarkable. The fact that opening statements could begin as soon as next week is quite incredible. And since justice has been so long delayed in the case of Donald Trump, with his legal team successfully putting off this reckoning, putting off that reckoning. To finally have him have to face justice, is, I think, quite an affirmation of the system finally.  ###"
April 16,Cindy Hyde-Smith,R,Miss.,HYDE-SMITH GAINS AG SEC. COMMITMENT FOR SMOOTH SIGNUP PROCESS FOR EMERGENCY FOREST RESTORATION AID,"Washington, D.C.— In case you missed it, yesterday, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) spoke to a group of over 100 local business and civic leaders from San Diego visiting Washington, D.C. as part of the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce’s annual delegation to the nation’s capital.During his remarks, Schiff highlighted his priorities for Southern California including tackling environmental challenges such as cross-border pollution from the Tijuana River, protecting and expanding key transportation infrastructure like the LOSSAN Corridor along California’s coastline, and his commitment to securing the federal resources needed to help cities across the state combat the dual housing affordability and homelessness crisis. Schiff also emphasized his commitment to working closely with local leaders, as well as House and Senate colleagues, to ensure that San Diego communities have the additional federal support and resources needed to meet their unique needs. See key excerpts of his remarks and photos below: On Combating the Dual Housing Affordability and Homelessness Crisis [...] Because the solution in San Diego may be different than Los Angeles, which may be different from the Central Valley, which may be different from every other state of the Union. But I think what we can productively do is to help provide the resources, help provide the incentives, help provide some of the metrics. Because I know the great frustration of our constituents is that we are spending money to try to solve this challenge, and people want to know they're willing to do it.They don't want their neighbors to be homeless, but they want to make sure that the money is well spent. And so I think one of the things that the federal government can help to productively do is not only share information about best methods, best approaches, what works in other parts of the state and country, but also help provide some of the tools to measure what is being successful.On Tackling Cross Border Pollution of the Tijuana River [...]And I know [Imperial Beach] Mayor Aguirre has been acutely focused on this, and I want to make sure that the federal government does everything possible to help solve this problem. There's simply no way that any city, along the coast or on the border can handle this challenge. This is an international problem. it requires an international solution.It’s going to require a lot more resources from the federal government. A lot better cooperation with Mexico. And, I certainly want to do everything I can with Senator Butler, with Senator Padilla, with your delegation to fight for those resources to solve this problem ASAP, to get that South Bay National Wastewater Treatment Plant working properly, to make sure that we deal with the pollution south of the border. And that we do whatever cleanup is necessary.On Continuing Key Investments for San Diego Transportation Infrastructure [...] I also want to highlight, as Mike Levin has reinforced to me time and time again, the importance of the LOSSAN Corridor and the incredible volume that that carries, and the need to make sure that we prevent that line from falling into the sea. And the thing of it is, through the infrastructure bill, through the Inflation Reduction Act, and other legislation, there is going to be a lot of money going out over the next several years. The only question is, where is that money going to go? And we want to fight to make sure that money comes to California and the money comes to San Diego, and we use it to address these major infrastructure challenges.   ###  "
April 16,Cindy Hyde-Smith,R,Miss.,HYDE-SMITH SEEKS TO ENROLL AT-RISK RURAL HOSPITALS IN DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM TO STAVE OFF CLOSURES,"Washington, D.C.— On Wednesday, Representative Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) spoke at the Armenian Genocide Commemoration on Capitol Hill to mark the nearly 109 years since the Ottoman Empire began their concerted, and systematic effort to destroy the Armenian people. Schiff’s 30th Congressional District, which includes the cities of Burbank and Glendale, is home to the largest Armenian diaspora community in the country. He also serves as Vice Chair of the Congressional Armenian Caucus. In 2019, the U.S. House passed Schiff’s resolution officially recognizing the Armenian Genocide with broad bipartisan support.    See key excerpts of his remarks below: On the Facts and Recognition of the Armenian Genocide  This month, 109 years ago, Armenians from all walks of life were rounded up and brutally murdered. Writers, artists, business owners. Clergy were tortured and burned alive in churches, infants stolen from their parents’ arms. Over a million men, women, and children. About a million and a half indeed. Entire families wiped out in the most brutal, heartbreaking of ways. All of you here likely to have someone in your family tree who suffered under the tragedy of this genocide.And yet, despite overwhelming and increasing, ever increasing evidence of this methodical mass killing, Turkey has engaged in a long and dangerous campaign to deny the genocide and to silence anyone who seeks to speak truth.Because of the district I represent, I've had the honor to sit with survivors. I've been welcomed into their homes. I've listened to their stories of how their parents and aunts and uncles and grandparents were murdered. How their property and the lives their families built were destroyed. I’ve watched them relive the pain over and over, reopening the wound to keep their family's history alive.And while we are gathered this month to commemorate these atrocities, there was a time when Washington refused to recognize these methodical killings for what they were — genocide. The first of the 20th century.Over many, many years, we've worked tirelessly to convince our colleagues in Congress, presidents of both parties and the American people, the importance of formally recognizing the Armenian Genocide.And I'm so proud that in 2019, I had the honor of carrying the resolution that officially recognized the Armenian Genocide and passed by a near unanimous and bipartisan vote.In 2021, President Biden became the first president in office to set aside decades of shameful silence and recognized the Armenian Genocide. These historic achievements took place because of a resilient and enduring Armenian diaspora and decades of work. It is a testament to thousands of activists, organizations, communities, and faith leaders. A victory for human rights and for the truth itself.On the Duty to Protect Armenians Abroad and to this day, President Aliyev of Azerbaijan continues to echo the genocidal language and actions of a century ago, and with the support of Turkey. They attacked Artsakh in 2020, they blockaded Nagorno Karabakh for nearly ten months starting in December 2022 and then in 2023, the Aliyev regime took control of the people they had systematically starved and ethnically cleansed — Artsakh’s indigenous Armenian population.So, as we mark the 109th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide with pledges of ‘never again’, the democratic and peaceful Armenian people face threats that echo their darkest days.The time for strong statements by the administration alone have long passed. Condemnation must be followed by real consequences. Crimes against humanity cannot be ignored and cannot go unanswered.On the Resiliency of the Armenian People  On this solemn anniversary as we pause to remember the innocent victims of the Armenian Genocide, we also reflect on the resilience of those who survived, and the perseverance of their children and grandchildren, who built lives in the United States and around the world, who speak their beautiful Armenian language, and enrich every nation with the Armenian culture and heritage.Despite the horrors the Armenian people have faced – and continue to face – it has not broken their faith, determination, or their will to survive. The Armenian people have overcome the harshest of trials and they remain strong and unbowed. In Southern California, in Yerevan and around the world.And I'm proud to be before you, and to say that I will always stand with the Armenian community. ###"
April 17,Cindy Hyde-Smith,R,Miss.,HYDE-SMITH STATEMENT ON SUPPRESSED MAYORKAS IMPEACHMENT TRIAL,"Washington, D.C.— Representative Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) joined Representatives Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.), Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) in introducing the Judicial Ethics Enforcement Act of 2024, legislation which will create an Office of the Inspector General to ensure accountability of justices in the Supreme Court of the United States.“It's essential that Americans have confidence that our judicial system is fair, impartial, and independent from inappropriate external influences,” said Rep. Schiff. “The Judicial Ethics Enforcement Act of 2024 is designed to ensure that Supreme Court Justices, who should be expected to meet the most basic ethical standards, are subject to effective accountability through oversight by the Office of the Inspector General. I am grateful to Representative Stansbury for spearheading this vital initiative to preserve the integrity of America's courts.""“Americans have lost trust in the Supreme Court,” said Rep. Stansbury. “Strong judicial ethics are critical to a free and democratic society. Safeguarding these fundamentals is necessary to ensuring we restore faith in our democracy and our institutions, and an Inspector General will hold the Justices internally accountable to the highest ethical standards to protect the Court from special interest groups looking to strip Americans of their rights to protect their personal agendas.”“CPD is proud to endorse the Judicial Ethics Enforcement Act and fight for the checks and balances this nation was founded upon,” said CPD Co-Executive Directors, Analilia Mejia and DaMareo Cooper. “Today’s Supreme Court is controlled by ultraconservative justices buried deep in the pockets of special interest groups committed to stripping our freedoms. It’s high time we held the Court to an ethics code that forces them to act with the fairness their job demands.”“The Supreme Court is in a state of crisis—between the corruption permeating its halls and the attacks on our fundamental freedoms, Americans have lost faith in our highest court,” said Tiffany Muller, President of End Citizens United // Let America Vote Action Fund. “The Judicial Ethics Enforcement Act of 2024 is a necessary step in holding the court accountable and restoring Americans’ confidence in the institution. We thank Congresswoman Stansbury and Senator Blumenthal for their ongoing leadership in the fight to reform the Supreme Court.”Specifically the Judicial Ethics Enforcement Act of 2024 Recently, Schiff introduced the Judicial Integrity Act, a critical bill that would hold federal judges and justices accountable for violations of their ethical duties and restore integrity to the courts. Last Year, Schiff introduced the Justice is Beneficial Limitation on Investments and Necessary Disclosure (BLIND) Act, a bill that would require judges to place their financial assets and investments into blind trusts. Schiff also introduced the Judiciary Act of 2023 which would expand the Supreme Court to 13 members. Later in September, Rep. Schiff joined as an original cosponsor of the Supreme Court Tenure Establishment and Retirement Modernization (TERM) Act, which would set term limits for Supreme Court justices while establishing a process for Supreme Court appointments. ###"
April 18,Cindy Hyde-Smith,R,Miss.,HYDE-SMITH COSPONSORS BILL TO STRIKE DOWN SEC CLIMATE DISCLOSURE RULE,"Washington D.C. – Eastern Washington Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (WA-05) delivered the following opening remarks at today’s Innovation, Data, and Commerce Subcommittee hearing titled “Legislative Solutions to Protect Kids Online and Ensure Americans’ Data Privacy Rights.” This hearing is the first step towards advancing the American Privacy Rights Act, the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA), and the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), and other complementary pieces of legislation.  “Right now, the average American spends nearly seven hours online a day, with two and a half hours of that time being spent on social media platforms. The consequences range from increased suicide rates and depression, to increased polarization and loss of trust in our institutions.  “All the while, these companies are collecting nearly every data point imaginable which they use to then control what we see and when we see it.  “Many of these tools were created with good intentions to bring people together. But over time they have strayed from their core mission in the interest of more control over our lives.  “This isn’t the American dream. America was built on individual liberty and freedom, freedom of thought, expression, and speech.”  REFLECTING BACK ON WHERE WE STARTED  “Our founders fought for these freedoms because they were tired of living under the crushing weight of tyranny. They were tired of being told how to think and how to live by a few elites who thought they knew best and who exploited others for their own power and wealth.  “Fast forward to today, we find ourselves living in a similar, modern form of digital tyranny, where a handful of companies and bad actors are exploiting our personal information, monetizing it, and using it to manipulate how we think and act.”  HOW WE GET BACK ON TRACK  “Many companies are using their control over our data to erode people’s agency, their rights, and their identity. It’s time for that status quo to change.  “Today, we will be discussing several pieces of legislation, including the American Privacy Rights Act, to give people the RIGHT to control their personal information online and not have it used against them. We’re putting people back in control of who they are, what they think, and how they live their lives.  “This is especially necessary for our children. As a mom of three school-aged children, Big Tech platforms are my biggest fear.  “The algorithms developed by these companies are specifically designed to get kids addicted to their platforms, and they’ve been used to target children with content that leads to dangerous, life-threatening behaviors.  “For me and my husband, as well as millions of parents across the country, this is a battle for our kids’ development, their mental health, and ultimately, their safety.  “We must build a better future for our children. They are our future.” THE AMERICAN PRIVACY RIGHTS ACT “The American Privacy Rights Act is foundational for protecting our kids online.  “Working together with other important legislation, like the Kids Online Safety Act, the Children’s and Teen’s Online Privacy Protection Act, and other bills, which we’re also discussing today, these solutions will ensure the best protections to date for our children.  “Today we find ourselves at a crossroads.  “We can either continue down the path we’re on, letting companies and bad actors continue to collect troves of our data unchecked while they trample on core American values, like free expression, free speech, and identity, or we can give people the right to control their information online.  “Congress has been trying to develop and pass comprehensive data privacy and security legislation for decades. With the American Privacy Rights Act, we are at a unique moment in history where we finally have the opportunity to imagine the internet as a force for prosperity and good.  “I’d like to thank Senator Cantwell for working with me on this landmark draft bill. I would also like to thank Ranking Member Pallone, who has been a trusted partner over the years as we have worked together on privacy. We would not be here today without his tireless efforts and leadership, and I look forward to continuing to work with him to strengthen privacy protections for Americans.  “I’d also like to thank Chairman Gus Bilirakis, Ranking Member Jan Schakowsky, the members of this committee—Republicans and Democrats—who are standing together here today, many of whom have also been involved in these efforts over several congresses.  “I am looking forward to working together on behalf of the American people to get this legislation through Congress and signed into law.” ### Washington D.C. – Eastern Washington Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (WA-05) delivered the following opening remarks at today’s Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee hearing titled “Examining Accusations of Ideological Bias at NPR, a Taxpayer Funded News Entity.” We invited NPR CEO Katherine Maher to testify at today’s @HouseCommerce oversight subcommittee hearing on accusations NPR is actively censoring […] Washington D.C. – Eastern Washington Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (WA-05) spoke on the House Floor this afternoon in support of the Hands Off Our Home Appliances Act (H.R. 6192), which will stop the Biden administration’s attack on consumer freedom and preserve the affordability, availability, and quality of the household appliances Americans rely on.  The legislation […] Washington, D.C. – Today, President Biden signed into law two pieces of legislation Eastern Washington Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (WA-05) championed to safeguard Americans’ sensitive data and protect national security.  The Protecting Americans’ Data from Foreign Adversaries Act (H.R. 7520), which Rodgers introduced with Rep.

Congressman Landsman will receive Community Project Funding applications and then select 15 projects to submit to the House Appropriations Committee to be considered. While the 15 projects Congressman Landsman submits to the House Appropriations Committee are not guaranteed to receive Community Project Funding, he will work with community partners in a transparent and bipartisan manner to submit projects that have the greatest likelihood of being approved by the House Appropriations Committee for Community Project Funding.

April 19,Cindy Hyde-Smith,R,Miss.,"HYDE-SMITH, BLUMENTHAL INTRODUCE BILL TO PROVIDE REFUNDS TO NATURAL GAS CONSUMERS FROM PIPELINE OVERCHARGES","Learn More Last week, Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (WA-03) and Rep. John Curtis (UT-03) introduced the bipartisan Water Systems PFAS Liability Protection Act to ensure that water utilities can continue to focus their efforts on maintaining water quality rather than defending themselves when PFAS polluters seek to dilute their liability. “PFAS chemicals have harmful effects on our health and children’s development – and water utilities are on the front line of the treatment and disposal of these substances,” said Rep. Gluesenkamp Perez. “This bipartisan legislation will help ensure policies to hold PFAS polluters accountable aren’t having unintended consequences on water utilities and ratepayers, especially in small and rural communities.” In 2022, the EPA formally announced plans to designate two of the most common PFAS – Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) – as hazardous substances under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). If finalized, this designation could put drinking water utilities at risk of incurring cleanup liability when they take necessary steps to remove and dispose of PFAS deposited into water supplies by upstream polluting industries. In addition, wastewater and stormwater utilities could also be put at risk as they receive PFAS chemicals through the raw influent that arrives at the treatment plan or through municipal stormwater runoff. While EPA has announced an “enforcement discretion” policy that intends to focus on polluters that are responsible for the contamination and have profited from PFAS, such a policy will be insufficient to ensure that drinking water and clean water ratepayers will be permanently protected from CERCLA legal defense costs and cleanup liability for PFAS. “We support this legislation which will take a meaningful step in protecting water utilities, who are passive receivers of PFAS, from financial and legal liabilities associated with decades of use of these chemicals in manufacturing and consumer products,” said John Peterson, Executive Director of the Discovery Clean Water Alliance. “PFAS is becoming the environmental challenge of our time. Water utilities can and will play an important role in reducing its prevalence in our environment, but subjecting them to undue financial burden and liability will only hurt the 150,000 residents who rely on – and pay for – our agency’s sewer services.” “The City of Vancouver provides clean drinking water and wastewater services to nearly 275,000 people in Clark County,” said Vancouver Mayor Anne McEnerny-Ogle. “It’s critical that we continue to invest our resources in identifying the sources and treating for PFAS rather than defending potential legal action for a systematic problem we didn’t create or control.” “At Thurston PUD, we thank Congresswoman Gluesenkamp Perez from Washington’s 3rd Congressional District for her leadership and support of water entities through her introduction of a House companion bill to the Senate-proposed Water Systems PFAS Liability Protection Act, said Julie Parker, Assistant General Manager of Thurston PUD. “This bill will shield the public utility ratepayers from liabilities that should be shouldered by the polluters as the law intended. Utility ratepayers are already footing the bill to pay to treat the contaminated water and dispose of the contaminates, they shouldn’t have to pay a third time for the problem.” “As not-for-profit, community-owned utilities, Washington public utility districts strive to provide safe affordable service to our ratepayers,” said Liz Anderson, Executive Director of the Washington Public Utility Districts Association (WPUDA). We applaud Congresswoman Marie Gluesenkamp Perez for her leadership on legislation that will help ensure polluters, not the public, pay for PFAS cleanup.” “In the West, and particularly in Utah, we understand deeply the value of clean water to our communities, our economy, and our way of life,” said Rep. Curtis. “This bill prevents the burden of industrial irresponsibility to fall on the shoulders of Utah’s families and ratepayers. It’s about ensuring that those who profit from these chemicals bear the cost of their impact, not the Utahns who rely on the integrity of their water supply.” Full text of the legislation is available here.

April 17,Gerald E. Connolly,D,Va.-11,"Connolly Joins McClellan, Virginia Colleagues in Pressuring USPS to Address Election Mail Delivery","Learn More Yesterday, Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (WA-03) and Rep. Pete Stauber’s (MN-08) bipartisan legislation, the Small Business Procurement and Utilization Reform (SPUR) Act, unanimously passed the House Small Business Committee.  The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is tasked with ensuring that small businesses are given a fair shot at competing for federal contracting dollars. Although the amount of federal contract dollars awarded to small businesses has reached record highs, the number of small businesses in the industrial base has declined dramatically. Data indicates the federal government is not retaining current small business contractors, and fewer small businesses are choosing to enter the federal market. The SPUR Act would require the SBA to include the number of new small businesses entering the federal contracting market as part of their consideration of each federal agency’s performance meeting small business contracting goals. “Even though more federal contracting dollars are making it to small businesses, fewer small businesses are deciding to take up federal contracts. For our local economies to thrive, it’s important that we level the playing field and ensure more Southwest Washington small businesses can benefit from these opportunities,” said Rep. Gluesenkamp Perez. “As more folks retire from the trades, the middle class will lose out if small businesses can’t clear the regulatory burdens of competing for contracts. I introduced this bipartisan legislation to help ensure our federal government is retaining and bringing in small business contractors – and today’s passage in the House Small Business Committee is another step toward getting this across the finish line.” Rep. Gluesenkamp Perez’s Corrective Action Report Oversight and Accountability Act passed the House Small Business Committee last year to help ensure federal agencies meet their benchmarks for the percentage of contracting dollars reaching women-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned, and small disadvantaged businesses.

April 19,Mark Takano,D,Calif.-39,Rep. Takano Hails Final Title IX Rule from Education Department,"Learn More Today, Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (WA-03) and Rep. David Rouzer (NC-07) introduced a bipartisan resolution to designate April 18, 2024, as National Lineman Appreciation Day and recognize the more than 115,000 hardworking men and women maintaining America’s electrical infrastructure. Cosponsored by twenty-six Members of Congress, the resolution highlights the critical work done by linemen to keep the public safe and protect our nation’s power supply every day since the first transmission line was constructed in 1889. Electrical linemen work atop power lines 24 hours a day, 365 days a year ensuring Americans can turn on their lights, run their businesses, and connect with loved ones.  They are not only installing new and replacing old power lines, but our nation’s linemen serve as frontline responders to natural disasters, reconnecting Americans in the wake of storms, fires, floods.  This resolution supports the designation of April 18 as National Lineman Appreciation Day, recognizing the efforts and courage of linemen in keeping the power on and protecting public safety; the remarkable contributions to the approximately 155 million electricity customers in America; the personal, family, and professional tradition of the trade; and the lineman’s role as a first responder following natural disasters. “As folks across Southwest Washington experienced heavy snow and ice storms this past winter, skilled linemen were called out to fix outages to keep us safe and warm,” said Rep. Gluesenkamp Perez. “Recognizing lineworkers’ bravery in dangerous conditions on behalf of their communities is how we continue to build bipartisan support for their work and elevate the trades in Congress.” “When natural disasters hit Southeastern North Carolina, it’s the brave lineworkers who operate in dangerous conditions to safely restore power and build our communities back as quickly as possible,” said Rep. Rouzer. “These hard-working men and women deserve our thanks for navigating any obstacle with skill and determination to keep the lights on in communities across the country.” Full text of the legislation is available here.

April 15,Adam B. Schiff,D,Calif.-30,Rep. Schiff Blasts NASA’s Disastrous Budget Cuts to Mars Sample Return Mission,"Learn More Today, Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (WA-03) and Rep. Suzanne Bonamici (OR-01) led a bipartisan, bicameral letter to the U.S. Army and Office of Management and Budget urging the allocation of $21.6 million of FY24 construction funding for the South Jetty at the mouth of the Columbia River. Prioritizing completion of the jetty would help protect Southwest Washington and Northwest Oregon ports and businesses that rely on the navigation channel. The Columbia River Basin is the third largest grain export gateway in the world. In 2020, roughly 51 million tons of cargo, valued at $22 billion, moved through the deep draft Lower Columbia River. The jetty system safeguards traffic through the gateway, supporting ports and businesses in Washington, Oregon, and the broader region. Frequent storms have degraded the jetties – and if they are compromised during an intense storm event, sand could accumulate in the channel and shut down commercial navigation at the river system’s entrance. Restoring access would require expensive emergency repairs and dredging. The Mouth of the Columbia River Jetty System Major Rehabilitation Project began in 2014 to address these risks, with the North Jetty and Jetty A having already been completed.  A remaining portion of the South Jetty requires completion, so the lawmakers are urging its prioritization through the FY24 work plan process. Without the funding, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers may not be able to complete construction without significant increases to the cost or timeline. “We respectfully request the Fiscal Year 2024 construction funding to complete construction of the Columbia River Jetties Rehabilitation so that our ports and harbors can continue to serve their communities and the nation,” wrote the lawmakers. “As our nation works to stimulate economic development and increase job growth, this project will assist in maintaining the navigation and trade assets that keep critical supply chains and goods moving.” Sens. Maria Cantwell (WA), Ron Wyden (OR), and Jeff Merkley (OR) and Reps. Suzan DelBene (WA-01), Cathy McMorris Rodgers (WA-05), Earl Blumenauer (OR-03), Val Hoyle (OR-04), Lori Chavez-DeRemer (OR-05), and Andrea Salinas (OR-06) also signed the letter. “We are extremely grateful for the delegation’s strong support for this critical infrastructure funding to complete the jetty rehabilitation at the mouth of the Columbia River, which will ensure cargo vessels and cruise ships can continue to traverse the Columbia River bar safely,” said Neil Maunu, Executive Director of the Pacific Northwest Waterways Association. “Last year over $27 billion worth of cargo transited in and out of the Columbia River. This river system is the gateway to the world and supports over 51 million tons of commodities and 25,000 cruise passengers a year. It is the lifeblood of the economy for our region.”  Full text of the letter can be found here. The letter is supported by the Pacific Northwest Waterways Association. Last week, Rep.

Last year, Budzinski announced a $7.8 million contract with the U.S. Army.  “The Belleville Shoe Manufacturing Company has played a critical role in equipping the men and women serving our nation in the armed forces since World War II,” said Congresswoman Budzinski. “I’m thrilled to announce a $10.3 million contract that will allow Belleville Boots to produce flight deck safety boots for the U.S. Navy. I’ve been glad to work on a bipartisan basis with Congressman Bost to support domestic military equipment manufacturing and I look forward to continuing to support the important manufacturing work happening in the Metro East.” “Belleville Boots is a proud Metro East company that generates local jobs and ensures our military men and women have the quality footwear they need to complete their mission. As a Marine, the father of a Marine, and the grandfather of a Marine, I was proud to help ensure that Belleville Boots remains an integral part of our local economy,” said Congressman Bost.  “Belleville Boot Company is thrilled to have been awarded a Defense Logistics Agency contract option worth $10.3M for the Navy Flight Deck and General-Purpose Safety boot. Our company is committed to producing the highest quality boots for the Navy, and we are excited about this opportunity to continue serving the sailors. We have a special connection to this particular boot, as we led the research and development, testing, and initial fielding efforts for this upgraded safety boot. These boots are worn by the all-important Aircraft Carrier Flight Deck crews who maintain, arm, launch, and recover aircraft, as well as the sailors across the Navy,” said Mark Ferguson, President of the Belleville Shoe Manufacturing Company. The Belleville Shoe Manufacturing Company is the oldest and leading manufacturer of boots for the U.S. Military – beginning with their first combat boot supply order during WWI. Belleville Boot supplies the largest selection of certified boots to the U.S. Military and develops an assortment of styles to meet specialized needs. Representatives Budzinski and Bost successfully included a bipartisan amendment to the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act to require the Department of Defense to examine current military footwear regulations and provide recommendations on improvements to support the footwear needs of our troops. This provision aims to support domestic military-grade boot manufacturing, like that done by Belleville Shoe Manufacturing Company. This provision also ensures that military footwear complies with the standards that military members need as large companies increasingly move into military boot manufacturing. ### SPRINGFIELD, IL — Today, Congresswoman Nikki Budzinski (IL-13) announced the winners of her 2024 Congressional Art Competition.

WATCH: Budzinski Calls on President Biden to Make Springfield Race Riot Site a National Monument WATCH: Budzinski Calls on President Biden to Make Springfield Race Riot Site a National Monument “The 1908 Springfield Race Riot is an example of our nation’s deep history of racial violence – it’s also the story of strength and resilience that led to the creation of the NAACP and the fight for civil rights,” said Congresswoman Budzinski. “Since coming to Congress, I’ve been pushing for our history to be appropriately recognized by introducing bipartisan legislation to designate the site of the 1908 Springfield Race Riot as a national monument, and by leading the Illinois congressional delegation in a request for President Biden to memorialize the site by invoking the Antiquities Act. Today, I was glad to continue calling on the White House to take action and honor Springfield’s important role in the Civil Rights Movement.” During the 1908 Springfield Race Riot, a mob of white residents attacked Springfield’s Black community, burning down homes and businesses and attacking hundreds of residents for no other reason than the color of their skin. In the aftermath of the riot, the NAACP was formed. During an excavation as part of the Springfield Rail Improvements Project, foundations and artifacts from homes destroyed during the riot were uncovered. An agreement with community members was reached in 2018 to excavate the remains and designate the uncovered site a memorial. One of the first bills introduced by Congresswoman Budzinski during her first term was bipartisan legislation with Congressman Darin LaHood and Senators Tammy Duckworth and Dick Durbin to recognize the significance of this tragedy with a national monument.

Facilities in Champaign and Springfield have been recommended for downsizing despite the region’s dismal on-time-delivery rates.  “Postmaster DeJoy has no business reducing mail processing capacity in areas that are already short staffed and struggling to receive mail on time. Today, I introduced bipartisan legislation that will halt these plans in Champaign and Springfield, and in underserviced areas across the country,”said Congresswoman Budzinski. “I’m grateful to Congressman Jack Bergman for joining me in this important effort to protect local USPS jobs and push back on a misguided effort that could further impact poor postal delivery rates in our communities.” “Bureaucrats in the U.S. Postal Service seem to have this misperception that they understand the delivery needs of the Upper Peninsula’s rural communities more than the people actually living there. My constituents rely on the Postal Service for the timely delivery of bills, payments, prescriptions, and other necessities, and they deserve a functional mail service, absent of manufactured delays caused by bureaucratic ineptitude. I thank my colleague, Congresswoman Nikki Budzinski, for co-leading this critical bill – the Protect Postal Performance Act – to halt the Postal Service’s ill-conceived consolidation plans in areas where the agency is already underperforming,” said Congressman Bergman.  Congresswoman Budzinski and Congresswoman Mary Miller (R-IL-15) have sent two letters to Postmaster General Louis DeJoy raising serious concerns about USPS plans to downsize the Champaign and Springfield Processing and Distribution Centers. The plans could mean worse delivery rates and the relocation of dozens of jobs to the Chicago and St. Louis areas. Budzinski also joined a letter with Senator Durbin, Senator Duckworth and other members of the Illinois delegation with concerns about what the USPS plans could mean for mail delivery across the state. Budzinski’s Protect Postal Performance Act would bar the USPS from considering facility downsizing in regions that aren’t meeting the USPS delivery targets of 90.3% on-time delivery for three to five-day first-class mail and 93% on-time delivery for two-day first-class mail. Downstate Illinois currently experiences a 64.2% on-time delivery rate for three-to-five-day delivery options and an 84.7% on-time delivery rate for two-day mail.  Full text of the Protect Postal Performance Act can be found here. ### SPRINGFIELD, IL — Today, Congresswoman Nikki Budzinski (IL-13) announced the winners of her 2024 Congressional Art Competition.

Stansbury, Raskin, and Omar in Introducing Bill to Demand Supreme Court Accountability","WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Representatives Nikki Budzinski (IL-13) and Angie Craig (MN-02) held a press conference in front of the U.S. Capitol as they led 95 New Democrat Coalition colleagues in a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson calling for immediate bipartisan action to fund the Affordable Connectivity Program. The American Rescue Plan created the Emergency Broadband Benefit, which provides discounted or free broadband for low-income households. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law expanded the program into the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), which provides a discount of up to $30 a month for qualifying low-income households. The ACP currently empowers 23 million households across the country to access affordable broadband. Without additional funding from Congress, the ACP will run out of funding, and millions of households could lose crucial internet access.  “When voters sent me to Washington, they tasked me with fighting to bring down the everyday costs that are holding too many working families back. That’s what the Affordable Connectivity Program is all about,” said Congresswoman Budzinski. “The ACP ensures that lower-income households can afford access to high-speed internet for work, school, health care and more. In 2024, access to the internet isn’t a luxury, it’s a necessity. Since the ACP was launched, more than 17 million households across the country have received support. In the district I serve, more than 75,000 households have subscribed to the Affordable Connectivity Program. And it’s saving families in my district nearly $40 million a year. I held a roundtable in East St. Louis where nearly every household benefits from the ACP. I heard about what this program has meant for students, for families, for workers, for patients. But this is all at risk if the ACP expires at the end of this month. My office has heard from more than 9,000 constituents who would be hurt by a disruption to this program. If Congress allows the ACP to lapse, internet services for millions of Americans could be disrupted. I’m proud to be here today to urge GOP leadership to maintain this critical program for families in my district and across the country.”  The letter Budzinski and Craig sent to Speaker Johnson reads in part: “As New Dems, we are committed to fighting to lower everyday costs for Americans; letting the ACP lapse will lead to a direct increase in broadband costs for consumers. We reaffirm our call to House Republicans to deliver for the American people and provide the ACP with the funding it needs without delay.” Full text of the letter can be found here and below: Dear Speaker Johnson, In the nearly three years since the establishment of the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, millions of American households have received aid from the ACP to access affordable broadband and participate in the 21st century economy. Without the monthly benefit the ACP provides, many Americans will lose access to distance learning, telemedicine, the online marketplace, and the numerous benefits that high-speed internet provides in everyday life. We are disappointed that despite the incredible impact on the 23 million households that have enrolled across the country, House Republican Leadership has blocked any consideration of the funding it needs to keep running, pushing us towards the program’s extinction. At a time of rising costs, Republican Leadership refuses to support this critical program that saves communities money. If Congress does not provide additional funding, April is the last month the full ACP benefit will be provided, and, in May, households will see changes in their bill. More than three-quarters of ACP-enrolled households could either experience a disruption or lose access to the internet entirely. We cannot let this happen. As New Dems, we are committed to fighting to lower everyday costs for Americans; letting the ACP lapse will lead to a direct increase in broadband costs for consumers. We reaffirm our call to House Republicans to deliver for the American people and provide the ACP with the funding it needs without delay. In January 2024, the bipartisan, bicameral Affordable Connectivity Program Extension Act was introduced, and, if adopted, would provide an additional $7 billion for the ACP.  This Act has broad support, including over 224 co-sponsors. We stand ready and willing to partner with you and the Republican Conference to keep Americans connected to the internet. ### SPRINGFIELD, IL — Today, Congresswoman Nikki Budzinski (IL-13) announced the winners of her 2024 Congressional Art Competition.

The Year-Round E15 Act would ensure that E15 sales can begin this year. The bipartisan legislation is co-led by U.S. Representatives Adrian Smith (NE-03), Brad Finstad (MN-01), Eric Sorensen (IL-17) and Don Bacon (NE-02). “Biofuels bring down fuel costs, reduce our dependence on foreign oil, cut carbon emissions and support critical markets for Illinois’ family farmers,” said Congresswoman Budzinski. “I was glad to see the Environmental Protection Agency take evidence-based action to allow the permanent sale of E15 in Illinois and across the Midwest, but this long-awaited action doesn’t take effect until 2025. Today, I’m proud to introduce bipartisan legislation with my friend, Congressman Zach Nunn, that will address this gap and allow for the sale of cheaper, cleaner fuel for Heartland consumers this summer.”  “Since day one, I’ve been fighting for year-round E15. Unfortunately, this Administration has repeatedly put America’s producers and families behind as they stubbornly opposed E15, which is good for the economy, good for the climate, and good for families,” said Congressman Nunn. “This bill wouldn’t be necessary if the Administration had just done the right thing to begin with, but this is a critical step to provide certainty for farmers, producers, and families who will benefit from less expensive fuel.”  In February, the Environmental Protection Agency finalized a rule in February that allows eight midwestern states to sell E15 year-round beginning in April of 2025. The rule applies to Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin. Budzinski released a statement praising the rule and calling for action to allow E15 sales for the 2024 summer driving season and secure permanent E15 sales under the law by passing legislation like the Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act. As a member of the House Committee on Agriculture, Congresswoman Budzinski has established herself as a bipartisan leader in supporting biofuels production and family farmers across Central and Southern Illinois. Her Next Generation Fuels Act, Sustainable Aviation Fuels Accuracy Act and Fuels Parity Act would take significant steps to support the future of homegrown biofuels.

Owens pressed Columbia President Minouche Shafik on the university’s response to antisemitic incidents on campus. The experience of Jewish students at @Columbia reminds me of my own experiences with hatred, denigration, and bigotry in the 1960s deep south. Campus leaders need to stand up to pro-Hamas activists and stand for a safe learning environment for ALL students. pic.twitter.com/I83rVe6iJx Click here or above to watch.  Rep. Owens asked President Shafik if university policy would be different if the students being attacked based on their identity were Black rather than Jewish, pointing out the double standard that exists at Columbia regarding anti-Jewish hate. “Would Black students be forced to attend the class of a tenured Columbia professor who, while discussing the massacre of Black men, women, and children – if Black girls were raped and Black men lynched – would speak in glowing terms of the event as ‘stunning, awesome, and astonishing,’” asked Rep. Owens. President Shafik responded by saying such a situation would “absolutely not” be tolerated on Columbia’s campus. Yet, Professor Joseph Massad, a 20-year tenured faculty member who described the October 7th attack on Israel as “stunning, awesome, and astonishing,” is still teaching Middle East studies classes at Columbia. “What truly speaks volumes regarding the moral compass of Columbia is that this rabid anti-Semite is still on your payroll today,” continued Rep. Owens. Rep.

April 16,Marie Gluesenkamp Perez,D,Wash.-3,"Gluesenkamp Perez, Curtis Introduce Legislation to Shield Southwest Washington Ratepayers from PFAS Cleanup Costs","WASHINGTON – Congressman Burgess Owens (UT-04) joined House Committee on Homeland Security Chairman Mark Green (TN-07) to introduce the Verifying that All Illegal Aliens Have Legitimate Documents (VALID) Act, to prohibit illegal immigrants from boarding commercial flights into the U.S. with only immigration-issued documents — not the proper state or federal identification required of all Americans. Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) is leading companion legislation in the Senate.  “Allowing illegal immigrants to bypass TSA and board commercial flights without a valid form of identification, while American citizens face strict airport security standards, is an outrageous double standard,” said Rep. Owens. “President Biden must put the safety and security of the American people above his open border agenda. The VALID Act closes this loophole, restores common sense, and shuts down the government’s ability to facilitate the travel of illegal immigrants across state lines at taxpayers’ expense.” “Allowing illegal immigrants to abuse commercial airline travel is unacceptable. While Americans must show proper identification to board their flights, illegal immigrants are not required to do so. Instead, the Biden administration is recklessly allowing migrants to use the CBP One app or even their Border Patrol arrest documents as identification. This puts Americans at risk. Illegal immigrants should have to comply with the same laws as American citizens, especially when it comes to valid identification. Refusing to enforce these laws poses severe national security risks,” said Chairman Green.  “Every American needs to show ID to enter our country. So why do we make it simpler for illegal immigrants to come in than for our own people? As our nation grapples with an unprecedented invasion at our southern border, the VALID Act resolves to close the loopholes that have allowed 200,000 illegal immigrants into the country unchecked. The Biden administration’s policies have blatantly facilitated this crisis, encouraging illegal immigration and compromising our nation’s security,” said Senator Lee.  “Shortly after 9/11 the U.S. Congress, through the REAL ID Act, recognized the importance of establishing certain security standards for identification documents to fly on commercial aircraft,” said Chad Wolf, former acting Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and Executive Director of the America First Policy Institute. “Each presidential administration since 9/11 has worked diligently to bring more security to our skies. Unfortunately, the Biden administration’s policy of allowing illegal aliens to use documents with unverifiable and unvetted information to board commercial aircraft defies common sense and congressional will and makes it easier for illegal aliens to travel than U.S. citizens and legal immigrants. The administration’s unlawful use of the CBP One app to mass parole inadmissible aliens into American communities raises both legal and public safety concerns. The VALID Act is an important step in reining in these abuses and ensuring the safety of the American people.” Original cosponsors of the legislation are Reps.

April 18,Marie Gluesenkamp Perez,D,Wash.-3,Gluesenkamp Perez’s Bipartisan Bill to Help More Small Businesses Access Federal Contracts Unanimously Clears Committee,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Last week, Rep. Michael Cloud (R-TX) supported a letter calling on President Biden to lift his ban on Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) exports, an issue critical to the South Texas energy sector, as part of deliberations over how Congress should deal with the fallout of the Francis Scott Key Bridge accident.   In January of this year, President Biden’s White House issued an indefinite ban on the issuance of LNG exports to non-Free Trade agreement countries — and announced no timeline for the end of the ban while the administration reviews “climate change” impacts. The ban has had tremendously negative impacts, not only on South Texas, but on the whole U.S. energy industry, with detrimental effects on job creation and economic opportunity in communities who need it. Furthermore, the lack of a clear timeline from the White House has created significant uncertainty for employers and energy providers, making a bad situation worse. In the wake of the recent Francis Scott Key Bridge tragedy, the conservative House Freedom Caucus has been evaluating ways Congress could assist in rebuilding the bridge while lessening the burden on taxpayers and minimizing the negative fallout of having a major port under construction. One of the proposed solutions, included in a letter sent from the Freedom Caucus to House leadership, proposed that the House require Biden to lift his LNG export ban before Congress appropriates funds for the bridge repairs. The Freedom Caucus letter states that “the Biden Administration’s pause on approvals of liquified natural gas export terminals — which, like the Baltimore harbor closure, has severe implications for foreign trade – must be lifted before Congress considers appropriating any funding for the bridge reconstruction.” Rep. Cloud released the following statement on the letter and his advocacy for Biden to lift his LNG ban: “Everyday President Biden is waging an economic war on our own country by hamstringing the wealth of resources we have at our disposal. This is having untold negative impacts on American workers, businesses, and energy providers — all in pursuit of the left’s futile climate change agenda, where even in a best-case scenario, the average American would receive minimal benefit at a tremendously high cost. The President’s ban on LNG exports was a bad decision with painful consequences – impacting my district and the whole country’s energy sector — and while we can’t afford this kind of self-inflicted damage on a given day, we especially can’t afford it with inflation still rising, the border in ruin, and a major harbor in shambles after a tragic accident. Biden needs to change course. That’s why my Freedom Caucus colleagues and I are pressuring the President on this issue, and why the President should lift his LNG export ban immediately. We should be looking for ways to relieve American taxpayers of their burden — not worsening it with a partisan political agenda from the left. Mr. President, it’s time to unlock the American energy industry and let them do their jobs.” To read the full text of the letter, click HERE. ### Today, Rep.

April 18,Marie Gluesenkamp Perez,D,Wash.-3,"Gluesenkamp Perez, Rouzer Introduce Bipartisan Resolution to Honor National Lineman Appreciation Day","WASHINGTON, D.C. — Following attacks on our ally Israel this past weekend, Rep. Cloud again expressed his support for the Israeli people and Jewish community at home in the U.S. On Saturday, it was reported that Iran had fired hundreds of missiles and drones toward Israel, though fortunately, the vast majority were intercepted by Israeli Defense Forces. This week, House leadership has indicated it will consider another aid package for Israel given the urgency after the attack. Rep. Cloud has previously supported aid for Israel and voted for the bipartisan H.R. 6126, the Israel Security Supplemental Appropriations Act, which included full offsets of government spending. Cloud has joined his conservative colleagues in the House Freedom Caucus in pressing House Leadership not to use the emergency situation Israel as a means of jamming through more unrelated aid on Ukraine, particularly without action on serious southern border security first. Rep. Cloud released the following statement: “My heart is heavy for the ongoing turmoil in the Middle East and I want to reiterate my prayers for peace. Israel has the right to defend itself and its people, and even though varying degrees of conflict in the Middle East have covered generations, since Hamas’ brutal and unprovoked attack on October 7, Israel has been in a unique danger coming from all sides. Sadly, this reached a boiling point on Saturday when Iran launched a direct attack using missiles and drones — especially unprecedented after years of waging war on the Israeli people through proxies. This cannot stand. Unfortunately, President Biden has continued to show a disturbing lack of leadership on this issue — not only choosing to isolate Israel with blame at a time when they are under attack, but also choosing to leverage the war in Israel as a means of spending more taxpayer funds in Ukraine. This would be unacceptable. As House conservatives have said, the Senate and President Biden should immediately take up and support the Israel aid package already passed by the House, with offsets, showing support for our ally at a critical juncture with no more burden to the taxpayer. Don’t play Ukrainian politics with Israel aid.”  To see the latest Freedom Caucus statement referenced earlier, click HERE. ### Today, Rep.

April 19,Marie Gluesenkamp Perez,D,Wash.-3,"Gluesenkamp Perez, Bonamici, Bipartisan Colleagues Support Prioritized Completion of South Jetty at Mouth of the Columbia River","WASHINGTON, D.C. — On Friday, Rep. Cloud voted NO on H.Res. 1160 — a rule to allow the House of Representatives to advance aid packages on Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan, but with no serious effort to provide border security. While Cloud joined 54 of his conservative colleagues in voting NO, ultimately, the rule passed 316-94. The rule passed with more Democrat support than that of Republicans — an extremely rare occurrence and a shocking deviation from usual procedure. 165 Democrats voted YES, while only 151 Republicans voted YES. This week, House Republican leadership announced their intention to pursue three bills — H.R. 8034, H.R. 8035, H.R. 8036, and H.R. 8038 — to provide aid to Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan, as well as something called a “sidecar” provision to implement a ban on TikTok, among other minor provisions. Conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus have been pushing Republican leadership to include serious border security measures within the combined rule, with the reason being that our government should put a priority on protecting our own southern border before sending money overseas. Additionally, because of the combined rule, if the House passed border security within the same rule, the Senate would be forced to combine both foreign aid and border security in order to advance the bill. Unfortunately, leadership chose to bifurcate the border security issue from the foreign aid package — meaning they separated the border bill into a separate vote, ensuring the border security measures would eventually die in the Senate. Now, the Senate can pass foreign aid without having to even consider the southern border. This amounts to what conservatives have criticized as “failure theatre,” only voting on things for political cover or messaging rather than in a serious effort to make law. There are also a number of grave concerns with the individual aid packages. For example, while the aid to Ukraine is structured as a “loan,” the bill gives the President extremely broad discretion to cancel 50% the debt after the November 2024 election, rendering it extremely unlikely that American taxpayers will ever see this money again. Furthermore, while Rep. Cloud has long supported military aid to our ally Israel, the bill providing Israel aid also includes $9 billion in aid to Gaza. There is overwhelming evidence that Hamas has stolen the vast majority of aid intended for innocent people in Gaza, and the bill contains little to no oversight mechanisms, meaning American taxpayers are essentially funding terrorists. This is completely unacceptable. Rep. Cloud introduced an amendment to give Israel coordination control over aid going into Gaza, as they have previously conducted much better oversight to ensure the aid goes to actual civilians, but House leadership rejected the amendment. Rep. Cloud released the following statement: “The uniparty is hard at work in Congress. My heart is heavy for our country, as I feel as though I’ve written the same thing over and over recently with the conduct of our government, but it is a sad day in America — and a stark reminder that the problems in Washington go well beyond one political party. Once again, Congress has failed to understand and work according to what should be our first priority: protecting our own country. Even as our own borders and our own people are suffering, House leadership just made it easier to send billions overseas without using valuable leverage we have to implement real border security. While I certainly understand the importance of helping innocent friends and allies in need, Congress should not be shipping billions overseas at the expense of the homeland. It’s wrong. My conservative colleagues and I are evaluating next steps, but we will not be giving up. While trust in leadership may be deeply broken, I will continue to fight for serious border security and for substantive change to Washington.” House leadership intends to vote on the aid packages on Saturday, April 20, after the rule advanced today. ### Today, Rep.

April 16,Nikki Budzinski,D,Ill.-13,"Budzinski, Bost Announce $10.3 Million Navy Contract for the Belleville Shoe Manufacturing Company","WASHINGTON, DC – Today, the United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a long-awaited report: “Public Health Preparedness: Mpox Response Highlights Need for HHS to Address Recurring Challenges.” Beginning in July 2022, Congressman Ritchie Torres (NY-15) was the leading Congressional voice urging the GAO and HHS to do such a report, and he is grateful to the GAO for tackling this crucial issue head-on. As a Co-Chair of the Congressional Equality Caucus and the sole LGBTQI+ member of Congress from New York City — which was the epicenter of the Mpox outbreak — Rep. Torres has fought tirelessly to ensure that his community’s vital health needs are not forgotten. In GAO’s report, they concluded that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) lacks a cohesive, department-wide strategy for learning from past public health emergencies to improve future responses. The GAO’s findings reveal a significant gap in the coordination among HHS’s component agencies, resulting in missed opportunities for leveraging collective experiences and insights. This fragmentation impedes the effectiveness of public health emergency preparedness and response. In addition, the report found that HHS’s ability to apply lessons and learn following an emergency response was further limited due to not always having all relevant stakeholders involved when identifying challenges and associated solutions. The report also identified shortcomings in risk communication efforts by HHS and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), particularly in reaching and clearly communicating risks to the most vulnerable populations. This includes the inadequacy of Mpox communication efforts in terms of inclusivity and the limitations faced by non-English speakers due to insufficient translation of critical public health information. In response to the report’s conclusions, Rep. Torres is today introducing the Coordinated Agency Response Enhancement (CARE Act). This legislation, if enacted, would: Require the Secretary of HHS to develop and implement a coordinated, department-wide after-action program that encourages collaboration between HHS’s component agencies, including integrating the existing public health emergency after-action programs of these component agencies. The after-action program should include relevant external stakeholders involved in each public health emergency response — such as other federal agencies, jurisdictions, and nongovernmental partners — when identifying challenges and associated solutions. Require the Secretary of HHS to direct the CDC and other relevant HHS agencies to develop and implement a comprehensive risk communication strategy that is inclusive and culturally sensitive. This strategy would be designed to clearly identify at-risk populations during public health emergencies and provide targeted, understandable, and accessible information to prevent the spread of diseases. The act would also require the translation of public health communications into multiple languages. Implementing a department-wide after-action program, coupled with a commitment to inclusive and culturally sensitive risk communication, would significantly strengthen the nation’s capacity to manage public health emergencies. By learning from past experiences and ensuring clear, accessible coordination, HHS can better protect all communities, particularly the most at-risk populations, against future health crises. This bill represents a critical step forward in our ongoing efforts to enhance public health emergency preparedness and response capabilities across the United States. On the report’s findings and the CARE Act, Rep. Torres released the following statement: “As I have long suspected, today’s report makes abundantly clear that our government’s disease response apparatus is not properly equipped to successfully coordinate and improve its systems and processes over time. In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and Mpox outbreak, it’s time we radically change our federal approach to public health. Marginalized and at-risk communities cannot afford to bear the brunt of another public health emergency, desperately waiting for the government to get its act together. I am urging my partners at HHS and across the Biden administration to read through the full report and implement a set of clear policies in response to mitigate future crises, and this is exactly what I intend to pursue with the CARE Act.” Additional relevant materials:CBS News: Rep.

I was proud to partner with Congresswoman Manning last year to reintroduce the Right to Contraception Act, legislation that would codify and strengthen the right to contraception, which the Supreme Court first recognized more than half a century ago in its Griswold v. Connecticut decision. And I am also a proud cosponsor of Congresswoman Escobar’s Access to Contraception for Servicemembers and their Dependents Act.

April 16,Joe Manchin III,D,W.Va.,Manchin Announces $669k For Wastewater Infrastructure Upgrades In Braxton County,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, U.S. Congressman Brian Mast (FL - 21) called on the Federal Trade Commission to probe the parent company of online retailer Temu over its ties to the Chinese Communist Party. ""Whether it’s Tiktok or Temu, behind these friendly English words, hide three nefarious letters — CCP,"" said Congressman Mast, a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. ""We need to be clear, if you’re a company operating within the U.S., you don’t get to hide your links to the Chinese Communist Party. That’s why I’m asking the FTC to probe Temu’s parent company for their links to the CCP and their questionable business practices."" Congressman Mast highlighted his concerns about Temu in a letter sent to the Federal Trade Commission urging the agency to open up an investigation. In particular, Congressman Mast wants to see the FTC probe whether Temu’s marketing efforts in the U.S. have been subsidized by communist China.  You can read the letter here. ###   Share This: https://mast.house.gov/2024/4/mast-demands-ftc-to-probe-temu-for-its-alleged-ties-to-ccp Fill out the form below to share your comments with Rep.

April 16,Ron Wyden,D,Ore.,"Wyden Announces Four Town Halls in Josephine, Curry, Coos and Douglas counties","WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Democratic Whip Katherine Clark (MA-5), Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries (NY-8) and Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar (CA-33) spoke to members of the press and emphasized that House Democrats are ready to stand with our allies around the word and will continue to stand up to the pro-Putin extremists. Below is a transcript of their remarks:  WHIP CLARK: Thank you, Mr. Leader. Thank you for putting this moment in the historical context that it deserves. We are here in a make-or-break moment for Ukraine, but also for the standing of the United States. Are we an ally who will come to the defense of another sovereign democracy? Are we going to stand up at this moment and say that we stand together with Ukraine and against the aggression of Putin? And we know that forces across Russia, but also across the aisle here in the House of Representatives, that want to see Putin be successful, that have been holding up this vital national security funding for months and moving the ball as they do it— moving the goalposts. So today's the day, and we stand ready as House Democrats to vote for our national security, to vote to stand with our allies across the world and send a message that we stand behind our word, we stand with our allies and we stand firmly for democracy. That is how we are going to continue to evaluate this package and that is how we will vote on this package when it comes before the House.  LEADER JEFFRIES: For months, America's national security interests have been put on hold, undermined by a group of extreme pro-Putin Republicans, who are determined to stop us from standing with our allies across the world and, in particular, the Ukrainian people, who have fought bravely and valiantly in defense of principles like democracy, freedom and truth. The time has come for the House of Representatives to act, and act decisively in America's national security interests. This is a Churchill or Chamberlain moment. We can either confront Russian aggression in defense of democracy, or we can allow pro-Putin extreme MAGA Republicans to appease. As events have shown in modern world history, appeasement of aggression gets you nowhere. When this was tried at the beginning of the events that precipitated World War II, it led to nothing for more than 100 million people losing their lives or being seriously injured as a result of the events of the Second World War. We cannot repeat our past mistakes. We have to make sure that we stand with our democratic allies in Ukraine, in Israel and in the Indo-Pacific and surge humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians who are in harm's way in Gaza through no fault of their own and civilians who are in war zones all across the world. That's our intention, to get that done over the next few days.   CHAIRMAN AGUILAR: Thank you Whip Clark and Leader Jeffries. America must maintain its role as the leader of the free world. House Democrats, for months, have been asking to vote on this national security supplemental to get aid to Israel, to Ukraine, humanitarian assistance and Indo-Pacific priorities. It is so important that we support those efforts. Speaker Johnson has to tune out the extremism on his side and give us an opportunity to vote to reach our national security imperatives.   # # # Permalink: https://katherineclark.house.gov/2024/4/whip-clark-we-are-here-in-a-make-or-break-moment-for-ukraine"
April 16,Ron Wyden,D,Ore.,Update: Oregon Delegation Applauds Approval of Federal Disaster Declaration for Ice Storms,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Democratic Whip Katherine Clark (MA-5) joined Congresswoman Alma S. Adams, Ph.D. (NC-12), and Congressman French Hill (AR-2), on behalf of the Congressional Bipartisan HBCU Caucus they co-chair, to welcome attendees to the Seventh Annual STEAM Days of Action, which began with a reception last night, Wednesday, in the Rayburn House Office Building, and concluded with an all-day event at the Library of Congress today.  Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, EPA Deputy Administrator Janet McCabe, U.S. Department of Education Deputy Secretary Cindy Marten, over a dozen Members of Congress and other leaders from HBCUs, businesses and non-profits also joined for a series of discussions and statements.   “America’s HBCUs are renowned for the community bonds they forge, the pathways to opportunity they pave for Black and Brown students, and the talented STEAM professionals they graduate every year,” said Democratic Whip Katherine Clark. “I am proud to join with HBCU Caucus Chair Adams in welcoming our nation’s HBCU leaders to the U.S. Capitol for this STEAM Day of Action. Working together, we will continue fighting to invest in HBCUs, lift up students, and ensure American talent remains unrivaled around the world.”  “I am so proud of the progress made and discussions we held at this year’s STEAM Days of Action program,” said Congresswoman Alma S. Adams, Ph.D., Democratic Co-Chair of the Bipartisan HBCU Caucus. “I want to thank Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Democratic Whip Katherine Clark, Deputy Administrator McCabe, and Deputy Secretary Marten, and all of my congressional colleagues for joining us and discussing how to direct more resources to HBCUs, protect and serve the communities they come from, and open more paths for their students. I also want to thank the business, non-profit, and university leaders who joined us and shared their ideas with everyone here at STEAM Days. In the 118th Congress, it is imperative that we continue convening robust discussions with key policymakers and appropriators to find more ways to support our HBCUs.”  “I’m thankful to Rep. Alma Adams for her incredible leadership on behalf of Historically Black Colleges and Universities, because when HBCUs succeed, America succeeds,” said Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries. “This STEAM conference is so incredibly important in making sure that we provide them with all the resources necessary to access the partnerships so that they can contribute in these areas of human endeavor.”  “I am thrilled to join Representative Adams and the bipartisan HBCU Caucus to celebrate the next generation of leaders in science, technology, engineering, art, and math,” said EPA Deputy Administrator Janet McCabe. “Through our first-ever HBCU-MSI Federal Advisory Committee, President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, and technical assistance programs, EPA is solidifying our partnership with minority-serving institutions to ensure that all Americans have equal access to critical environmental and public health protections and economic and educational opportunities.”  “I want to congratulate Congresswoman Adams on her 7th Annual STEAM Days and her decades of unwavering championship for HBCU schools, infrastructure, innovation and belonging in STEM spaces for all students,” said Department of Education Deputy Secretary Cindy Marten. “In order to be competitive in the economy of the future, we must work together to fund excellent educational opportunities at every level, with an intentional focus on equity. The Department of Education is committed to ensuring HBCUs have the resources they need and deserve to fulfill their mission and serve our nation.”  “Today, the Bipartisan HBCU Caucus welcomed academic, business, and thought leaders to Washington to participate in the seventh annual STEAM Days of Action,” said Congressman French Hill, Republican Co-Chair of the Bipartisan HBCU Caucus. “This event brings together dedicated supporters of HBCUs to talk about the challenges and successes of growing STEM and arts academic programming at our institutions. The event also welcomes those from the business community to connect with those from the colleges and universities to encourage them to build collaborative partnerships and position the next generation of students for success in STEM fields.”  The STEAM Days event included highly informative sessions with EPA Deputy Administrator Janet McCabe, and Department of Education Deputy Secretary Cindy Marten. McCabe and Rep. Adams talked about the ways HBCU graduates can access and benefit from the President’s Justice40 initiative, which ensures at least 40% of the benefits from the job-generating Inflation Reduction Act go to historically disadvantaged communities. During the panel moderated by recent Hampton University graduate, Jessica Simmons, Marten and Rep. Adams discussed the many ways the Department of Education can help direct more resources to HBCUs, including over $7 billion that the White House has already sent to HBCU campuses.  In his opening remarks, Congressman French Hill highlighted the impacts of HBCUs as economic engines for their local communities and for the wider U.S. economy. Congresswoman Terri Sewell (AL-07) also brought remarks, followed by a lunch panel featuring representatives from TIAA, IBM NCA&T State University, Delaware State University, and the Pathways Foundation, who discussed what organizations, schools and universities are doing in the STEM space new opportunities for students and their universities.  Reps. Rosa DeLauro (CT-03) and Suzanne Bonamici (OR-01) also joined Rep. Adams for a panel to discuss ways to appropriate more funding to support HBCUs over the long term.   The ongoing efforts by Reps. Adams and Hill, and the Bipartisan HBCU Caucus they co-chair, have coincided with both legislation and significant executive action. These include increased Research and Development and infrastructure funding for HBCUs through the U.S. Department of Education, and increased funding for HBCU line-items such as Title III, Part B, to their highest levels ever.    ###  Permalink: https://katherineclark.house.gov/2024/4/clark-adams-jeffries-deputy-heads-of-epa-education-wrap-up-steam-day-2024"

Arab Americans have made invaluable contributions to our nation. I look forward to getting April permanently designated as Arab American Heritage Month and ensuring that the Middle Eastern and North African community finally receives the recognition and resources they deserve.” “Arab Americans are part of the fabric of our country and are integral to our communities in Southeast Michigan and across America,” said Congresswoman Dingell. “They have helped shape Michigan’s identity, sharing their culture and traditions with us. They are doctors, teachers, business owners, service members, and most importantly, neighbors and friends. Arab Americans help make our state and country better every day.

This is a make-or-break moment for democracy around the world, and we must meet the moment.  “As Republican infighting continues, Democrats stepped up to provide the necessary votes for these critical measures to move to the House floor.  “For months, MAGA Republicans have endangered our national security by siding with Vladimir Putin and blocking resources that are urgently needed to sustain Ukraine’s fight to protect its democracy. The threat posed by Vladimir Putin goes far beyond Ukraine: He is working with our adversaries around the world to threaten America’s vital national security interests and endanger our allies.  “This package of bills also includes critical aid for Israel, our allies in the Indo-Pacific, and urgent humanitarian assistance for Palestinians and others in need of relief.  “Although this package is far from perfect, it presents the fastest path forward to provide  critical foreign aid to further America’s national security interests and send the message that we stand firmly behind our allies and for democracy.” ### Enter your email address to get the latest updates straight to your inbox.

""The U.S.-Japan alliance is strong in North Carolina, including in the Cape Fear Region where Japanese investments create jobs, help expand our national energy security, and contribute to the economic well-being of our farm families,"" said Congressman Rouzer.  ""I was proud to welcome Prime Minister Kishida to the U.S. Capitol to recognize the role of a strong U.S.-Japan Alliance in securing a free and open Indo-Pacific.  Japan is a pivotal ally and at a time of global instability, it is critical to reinforce cooperation between our two countries to ensure that liberty and prosperity survive."" Congressman Rouzer is a Member of the House Committee on Agriculture, where he supports efforts, such as the U.S.-Japan Trade Agreement, to ensure North Carolina farm families gain greater access to the Japanese market to help strengthen farm revenues. As his guest to the Joint Address, Congressman Rouzer was joined by a representative from Japan Tobacco International, a global tobacco manufacturing company with large investments in North Carolina's agriculture and manufacturing sectors. Japanese companies have a strong history of investment in North Carolina, totaling about 225 companies with 500 locations.  Japan also represents the largest foreign investor in North Carolina's economy and people.  NC State University's NC Japan Center focuses on the bilateral relationship by promoting business ties, bolstering academic collaboration, and fostering a greater understanding of Japan's footprint in North Carolina. "
April 19,Charles E. Grassley,R,Iowa,"Grassley Welcomes Summertime E15 Waiver, Renews Call for Nationwide Access Year-Round","WASHINGTON, DC - Today, Congressman David Rouzer (NC-07) introduced a bipartisan resolution to designate April 18, 2024, as National Lineman Appreciation Day and recognize the more than 115,000 hardworking men and women maintaining America’s electrical infrastructure. ""When natural disasters hit Southeastern North Carolina, it’s the brave lineworkers who operate in dangerous conditions to safely restore power and build our communities back as quickly as possible,"" said Congressman Rouzer.  ""These hard-working men and women deserve our thanks for navigating any obstacle with skill and determination to keep the lights on in communities across the country."" Cosponsored by twenty-six Members of Congress, the resolution highlights the critical work done by linemen to keep the public safe and protect our nation's power supply every day since the first transmission line was constructed in 1889. Electrical linemen work atop powerlines 24 hours a day, 365 days a year ensuring Americans can turn on their lights, run their businesses, and connect with loved ones.  They are not only installing new and replacing old powerlines, but our nation’s linemen serve as frontline responders to natural disasters, reconnecting Americans in the wake of storms, fires, floods.  During Hurricane Florence in 2018, more than 40,000 linemen mobilized to restore power to communities in Southeastern North Carolina. “Lineworkers are skilled professionals who rise to the challenge to perform difficult and dangerous work, at times in grueling conditions for long hours, all while adhering to strict safety protocols,” said ElectriCities of North Carolina CEO, Roy Jones.“Lineworkers prioritize the needs of their neighbors above their own to keep the lights on in the communities they serve. They are true hometown heroes, and I am proud to support this resolution and all efforts to recognize and celebrate the expertise, determination, and commitment lineworkers display every day.” ""We appreciate Congressman Rouzer's leadership on energy issues in Congress and his consistent recognition of the important role lineworkers play in the safe and efficient delivery of power across the country,” said Scott Batson, Duke Energy’s chief power grid officer. “Duke Energy is honored to employ more than 12,000 Duke Energy and contract lineworkers and technicians dedicated to not only the maintenance and repair of an essential component of the energy grid, but also public safety and community service in their communities - and other communities - when storms call them away from home."" ""Since 2012 to today the US Congress has honored the nation’s Linemen with a day of recognition and appreciation.  The US Senate in 2013 followed with a unanimous approval of National Lineman’s Appreciation Day, placing April 18th on the national calendar. April 18th originated as a day to honor linemen and the selfless dedication to the public and our nation’s electrical infrastructure. This day of recognition has occurred for 12 years, and the next step should be designating linemen as First Responders with the benefits that this title enjoys."" - Karen Bosch, Managing Director for National Association of Journeymen Linemen and Bill Bosch, Northwest Lineman College (Founders of National Lineman's Appreciation Day) This resolution supports the designation of April 18 as National Lineman Appreciation Day, recognizing the efforts and courage of linemen in keeping the power on and protecting public safety; the remarkable contributions to the approximately 155 million electricity customers in America; the personal, family, and professional tradition of the trade; and the lineman’s role as a first responder following natural disasters.

April 17,Michael D. Crapo,R,Idaho,Crapo Statement at Hearing on the President’s 2024 Trade Policy Agenda,"WASHINGTON, DC - This week, the House Judiciary Committee approved legislation led by Congressman David Rouzer (NC-07) to crack down on those who abuse the current asylum law.  H.R. 3591, the Asylum Accountability Act improves the integrity of the asylum system by significantly sharpening the penalty for those who fail to appear at their immigration court hearing. “Criminals, cartels, and human traffickers have taken advantage of the Biden Administration’s open-border policies and turned the asylum process into a get-out-of-jail free card,"" said Congressman Rouzer.  ""I thank the Judiciary Committee for passing the Asylum Accountability Act, which would help deter asylum abuse by permanently barring legal status for work, permanent residence status, or citizenship for anyone who fails to show up in court for their asylum hearing."" Background:

The current surge of crossings at the U.S. southern border is driven by the Biden Administration’s policies that incentivize illegal immigration.  With the mass influx of individuals coming across, cartels and smugglers are exploiting our asylum laws to facilitate illegal entry. 

Under current law, an illegal immigrant who fails to appear for their immigration court hearing is deportable and banned from immigration benefits for ten years.  According to a recent Government Accountability Office study, nine percent of all illegal immigrants enrolled in Alternatives to Detention ultimately absconded.

The Asylum Accountability Act amends the penalty for absconding from an immigration court hearing to a permanent ban of benefits, including legal status or citizenship, under the Immigration and Nationality Act.

Neal (D-MA) released the following statement today marking the end of the 2024 tax filing season:  “Another smooth and successful filing season comes to a close, thanks to Democrats’ commitment to full and fair tax administration. After more than a decade of Republican underfunding, we breathed new life into the IRS with the Inflation Reduction Act: 1 million more calls were answered, over 170,000 more filers were helped in-person, new digital tools were made available, and wealthy tax cheats were held to account. The Direct File pilot opened up a new, secure and free way to file for taxpayers, and its success will only continue to ease their experience.  “House Republicans want to erase all our progress, not only by blocking our accomplishments and weakening the IRS, but also by ramming through another round of deficit-busting tax cuts, all in service of protecting billionaires and big corporations. Ways and Means Democrats share the Biden Administration and Commissioner Werfel’s steadfast commitment to one system for all—ensuring our tax code puts workers and families first, and delivering the service taxpayers deserve.”   ###

I have had the pleasure of knowing the Monaghan family for many years, and my heart goes out to them during this difficult time. Eileen was a truly kind and intelligent person who dedicated her life to public service.

April 17,Michael D. Crapo,R,Idaho,"Crapo, Risch, Scott Lead Effort to Roll Back SEC’s Climate Disclosure Rule","(As prepared for delivery)   Ambassador Tai, welcome back to the Committee. You’re joining us in a time of great progress and potential. 15 million jobs have been created under President Biden, wages continue to rise, and unemployment has been under 4% for the longest span in decades. Our economic success has defied expectations. I saw a headline in the Wall Street Journal that read, and I quote, “Envy of the World—U.S. Economy Expected to Keep Powering Higher.”   Putting workers and their families first made this possible. We’re building an economy from the bottom-up and the middle-out, putting weight to the phrase “Made in America”. Through targeted investments, we’ve supercharged domestic manufacturing and improved supply chain resiliency, all while creating millions of jobs. For years to come these successes will continue to unfold, but in the meantime, we can return to our roots as a maritime nation. Bolstering our commercial shipping industry with a comprehensive strategy to expand the sector and grow the workforce is the next frontier for Making it in America, and I look forward to working together on this.    Our investment in combatting climate change, which is the largest in our nation’s history, is already ushering in hundreds of thousands of new, good-paying jobs, and spreading green investment across the country. The success of late has shown just how interconnected workers’ rights, environmental protections, and a growing economy are. Ensuring that our trade policies support our values is critical, and I’m grateful for your leadership in what will be a lasting shift from the trade policy of yesterday to the Biden Administration’s worker-first agenda.     As our nation’s lead trade negotiator, you have fought to ensure that America’s workers and businesses have the tools they need to compete in today’s global economy and strengthened our relationships with our allies across the world. Most recently, at the World Trade Organization’s MC13, securing an agreement on the e-commerce moratorium and making welcome progress on fish subsidies.    Robustly enforcing our trade agreement is another way you’ve put workers at the center of our trade policy. With USMCA standing as the beacon for what’s possible, labor and environmental protections are no longer additions on top of an agreement, but now the very foundation of any agreement.    I credit much of this progress to the work and consensus-building of Congress. The collaboration between Congress and the Executive is necessary for the success of trade policy. Only through this collaboration can durable, enforceable agreements be created, and can trade policy live up to its fullest potential. There’s no better recent example than the Taiwan trade legislation signed into law last year. It is on this dais that the Congress expands economic ties and stands up for workers around the world, and together, we will continue using trade as a powerful driver for good-paying jobs and a thriving economy.     We are up against strong forces that threaten our progress. Whether it be Putin’s unprovoked war on Ukraine or China’s nonmarket practices, or even the Republican nominee’s interest in purposely weakening the dollar. Amidst these challenges, we’ve seen unparalleled unity with our allies, and I look forward to working together on capitalizing on this momentum to deepen our economic connections, particularly in Africa, the Caribbean, and Europe.   We’ve seen what’s possible with values-based trade policy, and when we work together, guided by doing what’s right for the people, we can spread opportunity and prosperity. Ambassador, thank you for joining us today, I yield back the balance of my time.   ###"
April 18,Michael D. Crapo,R,Idaho,"Crapo, Risch, Tuberville Hold Biden Admin Accountable for Taxpayer-Funded Abortions Facilitated by the VA","(As prepared for delivery)   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.   Before I begin, this week, an esteemed member of the Ways and Means Staff will head to the Biden Administration to lead textile negotiations for the United States Trade Representative. Katherine White has been a dedicated and diligent staffer, and her work on the frontlines of negotiating USMCA make her the perfect pick for this role. Katie, you will be greatly missed, and we wish you all the best in this next chapter.    Now turning to today’s markup. Sadly, today is another rushed, partisan markup of do-nothing, unvetted legislation that had there been a real negotiation could’ve been bipartisan.    The Ways and Means Committee has a long tradition of bipartisanship, particularly on trade. When Putin launched his unprovoked war on Ukraine, this Committee quickly worked together to suspend normal trading relations. We’ve worked together on several iterations of legislation to strengthen our relationship with Taiwan. Not only can it be done again, but it should.    To seriously legislate, there must be a real desire for bipartisanship, and putting in the time to send proposals back and forth, seek proper consultation from the many stakeholders, and ultimately, the will to compromise. It always helps to have a pathway into law, which none of these bills have.   Many of the issues before us today are ripe for action, and Democrats have a demonstrated interest, but changing text less than 24 hours before this markup and announcing your changes publicly in a hearing isn’t how you win our support.    For anyone who has seen the bill names today, you may be fooled into thinking this slate of bills is tough on China. Let me tell you though, you can’t only talk tough. The Majority affords the ability to legislate tough and today’s legislation falls far short of what the American people need.    The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program was conceived as a bipartisan, developmental trade program, and I’ve long said that I want to reauthorize GSP, but it must be done with the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program. Recently, this committee had a major bipartisan accomplishment on tax, which can be unheard of, but it was possible because we paired what my Republican colleagues wanted for business with what we wanted for workers and families. The same approach could’ve been applied here. Yet this bill is a weak façade for retroactive handouts to corporations with no meaningful consideration given to workers.    Ahead of this markup, I heard from mothers who have lost children to Fentanyl ordered from China and transported by public and private domestic shipping channels right to their homes. And just yesterday, the select China Committee released their report showing that China is actually fueling this crisis. How can the Majority consider their de minimis legislation ready for primetime when it fails to address this? Or what about the influx of gun silencers making their way into Americans’ hands from China?  These are major public safety concerns, and we have the power to do something.    We are also living through a pivotal moment for American workers. As companies continue to notch record profits, our workers are reclaiming their rightful place in our economy. Our unions are strong, wages are up, and workers are fighting for the benefits they deserve.    For years, our workers have been asking us to reauthorize TAA, and I just learned of a few new plants closing in districts of members on this Committee. When all you care about is the success and will of big business, you ignore those voices and realities, and can only muster lip-service to workers.    I am pleased that there seems to be some movement from my colleagues on the Inflation Reduction Act. I believe today marks the first time that instead of repealing the legislation, they are attempting to influence its implementation. It’s hard to argue with over 270,000 jobs and 520 projects across 47 states and Puerto Rico in less than two years. In President Biden’s time in office, we’ve made unprecedented strides in tackling climate change while growing the clean energy economy.    The Inflation Reduction Act turbocharged our EV and critical minerals supply chains, bolstering domestic manufacturing. Treasury’s proposed guidance strikes the proper balance between building out our emerging electric vehicle (EV) market and strengthening our energy security while encouraging diverse and resilient global supply chains. Since President Biden took office, EV sales have more than quadrupled, with over 4.5 million EVs on our roads.   Try as they might, shouting China won’t distract the American people from the Majority’s inability to legislate. We are on the precipice of another motion to vacate the Republican Speaker, and today’s slate of legislation is nothing more than a veneer on getting tough on China by a group that actually has the ability to be tough.   With that, I yield back the balance of my time.    ###"
April 18,Michael D. Crapo,R,Idaho,"Crapo, Risch, Emmer Demand Administration Evaluate U.S. Supply Chain for Smokeless Gunpowder","Ways and Means Committee Ranking Member Richard E. Neal (D-MA) released the following statement applauding the Biden Administration for initiating a Section 301 investigation into China’s unfair trade practices in the maritime industry:   “With our historic leadership on domestic manufacturing and success in building out domestic supply chains, Democrats are returning American workers to their rightful place at the center of our economy. We’ve built the strongest economy in the world, and the next step is ensuring American workers and businesses have the tools they need to compete in the global economy. Today’s news that the Biden Administration is launching an investigation into China’s unfair practices in the maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding industries is another proof point that President Biden puts American workers first and even more evidence of the strength of labor in moving these critical conversations forward.   “This announcement underlies the importance of creating the national shipbuilding strategy I called for earlier this year, which will help grow our economy and bolster our national security. America’s history as an economic superpower started on the high seas, and President Biden has made it clear that bringing the shipbuilding sector and the good-paying jobs it creates back to our shores is the next step to investing in America. Ways and Means Democrats stand ready to work with the Biden Administration and Ambassador Tai as the investigation moves forward.”   Earlier this year, Ranking Member Neal announced his work on formulating a national commercial shipbuilding strategy, as well as applauded the labor unions for filing this petition."
April 18,Michael D. Crapo,R,Idaho,"Crapo: President Biden’s Trade Agenda Lacks Ambition, Enforcement","Hard-line House Republicans are coming out in strong opposition to House Speaker Mike Johnson‘s (R-LA) four-pronged foreign aid package, particularly over a stipulation in the Ukraine aid bill that the loan can be canceled by the president in a few years — a move that some are calling a “joke.” Johnson’s long-awaited four-bill foreign aid package, for which text was released on Wednesday, includes aid to Ukraine, Israel, and the Indo-Pacific, all in separate bills. As part of the Ukraine bill, nearly $7.9 billion will be provided to Ukraine under the “Economic Support Fund,” and nearly $1.57 billion will be provided for “Assistance for Europe, Eurasia, and Central Asia” to Ukraine and other countries. A breakdown of the package from the speaker’s office and House Appropriations Committee touts Ukraine aid as a “loan” and says the legislation “mandates agreement on repayment for economic support by the government of Ukraine.” However, buried in the text is a section that stipulates that the president can cancel up to 50% of the loan after Nov. 15, 2024, with congressional review. After Jan. 1, 2026, any remaining debt can be canceled. The bill itself, as well as the loan repayment, angered some House GOP members who believe the United States won’t see any money return. “I think it’s a joke,” Rep. Tim Burchett (R-TN) said to the Washington Examiner. “They’re not gonna pay us any money. We’re gonna rebuild that country afterwards, probably, or part of it.” He added that he thinks several House Republicans are going to vote for the Ukraine bill and use the loan to “justify it.” Rep. Scott Perry (R-PA) said in a post to X that the loan for Ukraine is “all smoke and mirrors” and blasted the president’s ability to cancel 50% of the loan by this November, adding that “no bank would allow this.” The passage of Ukraine aid could cost Johnson his speakership, as Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) continues to hold her motion to vacate, which she filed last month, over his head. She previously said how Johnson handled Ukraine aid and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act reauthorization would dictate how she moves forward with the motion to vacate. “Monday was Tax Day. So as Americans were paying their hard-earned tax dollars to this government, the Republican speaker, hinging his entire ability to stay speaker on sending $64 million to Ukraine — I can’t think of a worse betrayal ever to happen in the United States history,” Greene told reporters on Thursday. The decision to include debt cancelation is a sign that House GOP leadership is putting some distance between the foreign aid package and former President Donald Trump’s demands over how to handle Ukraine aid, as it becomes more clear that Johnson needs bipartisan support to push his four-pronged plan over the finish line. Trump, who has shown several times his influence stretches over the House GOP, said during a meeting with Johnson last week that Republicans should push for making additional aid to Ukraine “in the form of a loan rather than a gift.” In a post to Truth Social on Thursday, he blasted the United States for its financial involvement in the country’s war against Russia compared to other nations. “Why isn’t Europe giving more money to help Ukraine? Why is it that the United States is over $100 Billion Dollars into the Ukraine War more than Europe, and we have an Ocean between us as separation! Why can’t Europe equalize or match the money put in by the United States of America in order to help a Country in desperate need?” the former president said. During a press conference on Wednesday, Johnson said that adding the loan forgiveness provision might be a “very important chip in a game” down the road, such as brokering a peace deal. “That might be an important thing to have, an important option for the president to have, and I think that makes sense to Republicans and Democrats,” Johnson said. “We would want the Commander-in-Chief to make those decisions, and then Congress, of course, has oversight over all of it, so I think it’s a good policy.” President Joe Biden came out in strong support for Johnson’s foreign aid package on Wednesday, calling on the House and Senate to pass the bills and stating he would sign it into law “immediately.” The ability to cancel up to 50% of the economic support loan to Ukraine is a win for Democrats and Biden, who has made loan cancellation for student debt a key component of his presidency and his reelection campaign. Just days after the election in November, Biden would be able to forgive half of the U.S.’s loan to Ukraine. Rep. Bob Good (R-VA) also called the loan forgiveness a “joke,” adding “it’s not real.” “First of all, the bill as it’s written gives Biden the ability to waive 50% of it anyway,” Good said to reporters on Wednesday. “This is the guy who wants to waive all student loans — why wouldn’t he waive Ukraine’s loan? And you know, we got a long list of nations who haven’t paid us back money that was supposedly loaned to them, so.” Some Republicans in the Senate are not too pleased with the framework of Johnson’s Ukraine aid bill, as well. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) told the Washington Examiner he thought the loan idea was a “little gimmicky.” “And maybe I don’t understand it well enough,” Hawley said. “So, I’ll try to do my homework here, but I don’t know — if they can repay the loan, would they be asking for the money? I mean, they’re not going to repay it.” “You may as well just call it what it is, which is an outlay. I mean, it’s just spending,” the Missouri senator added. “But, again, maybe I’m missing some profound nuance.” The Washington Examiner reached out to Trump for comment."
April 18,Michael D. Crapo,R,Idaho,Crapo Legislation to Defund Biden’s Electric Vehicle Mandate Receives Senate Vote,"WASHINGTON — Today, Speaker Johnson, Leader Scalise, Whip Emmer, and Chairwoman Stefanik released the following statement after the Democrat-led Senate voted to dismiss the articles of impeachment brought against Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, ignoring its constitutional duty to hold a trial. “By voting unanimously to bypass their constitutional responsibility, every single Senate Democrat has issued their full endorsement of the Biden Administration’s dangerous open border policies. Secretary Mayorkas alongside President Biden has used nearly every tool at his disposal to engineer the greatest humanitarian and national security catastrophe at our borders in American history. “Tragically, Senate Democrats don’t believe this catastrophe merits their time or a discussion on the Senate floor. Instead, they’re signaling to millions demanding accountability that the cabinet official directly responsible for this disaster – who has ignored the law and misled Congress repeatedly – is above reproach. The American people will hold Senate Democrats accountable for this shameful display.”"
April 19,Mary Gay Scanlon,D,Pa.-5,Scanlon Statement on House Rules Committee Vote to Advance Critical Funding for Ukraine and Allies,"WASHINGTON — This afternoon, after announcing the House’s national security supplemental plan, Speaker Johnson joined Larry Kudlow on Fox Business’ Kudlow and Jake Tapper on CNN’s The Lead to discuss the House plan, the need for urgent border security measures, and the motion to vacate. “What we’ve done is taken the Senate supplemental bill, and we’ve improved the process and the policy, and that’s a really important thing,” Speaker Johnson said.  Click here to watch Kudlow, here for The Lead On the supplemental national security package: What we've done is we've taken the senate supplemental bill, and we've improved the process and the policy, and that's a really important thing. What we've done for example, in the Ukraine piece of this, is we've added the loan instrument concept, we've added the REPO Act - which everybody knows is the seizure of corrupt Russian oligarchs’ assets - to be used to fund the effort in Ukraine. We introduced a lot of new accountabilities and oversight. The Congress has a responsibility to do and the strategy shift as well. We're going to require within 45 days, the White House to deliver to Congress a meaningful plan. What is the endgame here? What's the objective and how are we going to accomplish this and bring this conflict to an end? By the way Larry, on Ukraine, 80% of what we'll spend here goes to America's industrial defense base, and that's a replenishment of our stocks and weapons. And I think that's a really important point. We're also adding sanctions against Russia and Iran and all our adversaries including China, and that's a really important thing as well. So, the House will do its will and have a rigorous amendment process to the underlying legislation. On the urgent need to support U.S. allies: You got to be tough on your adversaries. The problem is you and I both know, Larry, this President is projecting weakness on the world stage and that's why all our nation's enemies are acting so provocatively. On the Israel example, I mean, President Biden and Chuck Schumer had been criticizing Israel and appeasing Iran, that strategy should be exactly the opposite. We should be helping Israel and they've been turning their backs on them. And then of course, this encourages Xi and encourages China, when they see that we're not going to stand strong and we're not going to put the flag in the ground so to speak and hold the line. They're going to act, they're going to move, and we're concerned about what China may do in Taiwan. We talk about it all the time. We're certainly concerned about Iran's open aggression now against Israel, our dear friend and ally. And Russia, of course, is still on the march in Ukraine. We must stand strong. A strong America is good for the entire world. We bring stability and peace – the perception that America is strong is important and has been since World War II and we cannot let down that responsibility. On border security: Some of my colleagues want the Speaker of the House to have a magic wand. If we could close the border ourselves, we would have done it a long time ago. We passed HR 2 over a year ago, it's sitting on Chuck Schumer's desk. That had all the components. It closes the border, changes asylum processes and problems, ends catch and release and in reinstates remain in Mexico. All the things that President Trump had done so effectively, Biden reflexively did the opposite. And that's been the problem. We pass resolutions, we pass the laws, they sit on Chuck Schumer's desk in the Senate because again, the Democrats run the Senate, the Democrats run the White House, and they want an open border. That voter ID, the idea that you would have to prove that you're a US citizen to vote in a US election, a federal election, is critically important. We're going to move that in the days ahead as well. That's what we were talking about at Mar a Lago at the press conference. But the American people demand this, they deserve it. We know the border is a catastrophe. And the reason that we're bringing to the floor this week, the End the Border Catastrophe Act, is because it's aptly named. And it describes what is on the hearts and minds of every single American. It doesn't matter where you live. I've been in 23 states in the last seven or eight weeks Larry traveling around the country. It doesn't matter whether I'm out west, upstate New York, deep south, Midwest, it's all the same. Everybody knows, this is what we must do. If you don't have a secure border, you don't have sovereignty; you don't have security. You don't even really have a nation. And that's what Joe Biden has put at risk. And that's why we had to impeach Mayorkas. On President Biden’s weakness: I think this sets up the next election, the next administration, the next president, and I believe [Trump is] going to win - in a better position. I think that President Trump is strong enough that he could enter the world stage and broker a peace deal in Ukraine, if Russia is still advancing at that time. I mean, I think he has the strong enough hand to be able to do that. And that's why this election is so important. There's a very stark contrast - you know we didn't have all these global conflicts. We didn't have hot wars around the globe when Donald Trump was the president. You know why? Because our adversaries feared him and respected. They don't fear and respect Joseph Biden. And that's a real problem for all of us. On the motion to vacate: I'm not asking the Democrats to get involved in that I believe the house will do as well. Look, I'm trying to govern and lead this institution at a very interesting, unprecedented time. We have challenges right now that no previous generation has faced. Newt Gingrich posted a few days ago on social media. The speaker’s job is effectively impossible. Now he said that I'm doing the hardest job that maybe it has ever been in the history of the U.S. House. Maybe, he said, arguably since the Civil War. Why because we live in a very divided time and very divisive politics in the age of social media. 24-hour news cycle, where everybody can express their opinions every moment of the day but things they’re disgruntled about. It makes a lot of challenges, but we're going to get through this. Listen, we are the greatest nation in the history of the world. Okay, we are going to show that we're going to keep the train on the tracks and not get derailed and get involved in all of this. It's such a dangerous time on the world stage and that look, I don't walk around thinking about the motion to vacate. It's a procedural matter here that I think it's been abused in recent times. Maybe at some point we change. Right now, I’ve got to do my job. And so do all my colleagues. And I'm confident at the end of the day, in spite of all the drama, and all the palace intrigue, I think we're gonna get that done."
April 16,David Rouzer,R,N.C.-7,Rouzer Joins Congressional Escort Committee for Joint Session with Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio,"WASHINGTON — On Wednesday, Speaker Johnson announced the House response to the Senate’s national security supplemental legislation. This legislation is comprised of four separate bills and provides resources to Israel, Ukraine, and the Indo-Pacific, as well as measures to counter adversaries in each region. “This legislation also includes enhanced oversight and accountability of U.S. taxpayer resources and includes upgrades to the Senate bill like the REPO Act and transferring portions of Ukraine aid into a loan. What we’ve done is taken the Senate supplemental bill, and we’ve improved the process and the policy, and that’s a really important thing,” Speaker Johnson said. Conservatives, faith leaders, advocacy organizations strongly support the legislation: “AIPAC strongly suppots Speaker Johnson’s work to bring important national security bills to the floor, and we urge every House member to vote for crucial security aid to our ally Israel,” —  AIPAC. “The Israel Supplemental Appropriations Act provides critical support to a key ally facing our common enemy, Iran. This is especially true now that Iran has attacked Israel directly, not just through proxies. We call upon all Members of Congress to support the rule & the bill,” — Coalition for Jewish Values. “We urge all members to support the rule allowing the foreign aid bill to come to the floor so we can deliver critical emergency military assistance to Israel. Don’t tell us you stand with Israel, show us,” — Christians United for Israel. “In the aftermath of the October 7th Hamas massacre and Iran’s direct attack against Israel’s homeland, these votes are an especially critical test of support for the US-Israel alliance. The time to act is now,” — Republican Jewish Coalition. “We welcome the release of the House of Representatives' security supplemental package, which includes a number of vital measures that AJC has long advocated for, such as security assistance to our allies Israel and Ukraine, and funding for the Nonprofit Security Grant Program to keep Jewish communities in the U.S. safe. We urge its swift passage,” — American Jewish Committee. “It is absolutely critical that Christians in America and around the world stand with Israel, protect Israel's right to defend itself, and work to contain this conflict so that it doesn't threaten global peace. We stand with Israel,” — Family Research Council. “The leadership of Speaker Mike Johnson has been crucial in defending life, religious freedom, fiscal responsibility, and important allies like Israel. He always stands strong and we're proud to stand with him,” — Center for Urban Renewal. “As former Secretary of State and former Vice Chief of Staff of the Army we write at a pivotal moment in our nation’s history to applaud your efforts to secure vital support to America’s allies and to strengthen America’s defenses,” — Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo & Vice Chief of Staff to the Army Jack Keane. “Speaker Mike Johnson is a man of incredible character, who has unequivocally shown his support of protecting the unborn, the family, and standing strong with one of our greatest allies, Israel. In light of Iran’s unprecedented attack against Israel last week, we must ensure that every Republican is supportive of the Speaker’s efforts to bring Israel funding to the finish line as quickly as possible. CWALAC supports Speaker Johnson and his efforts to support Israel,” — Concerned Women for America LAC. “Last week, the ERLC sent a letter to Speaker Johnson & all members of Congress urging them to pass critical support for Ukraine. While there are some political headwinds, I’m grateful Mike Johnson is moving forward to help Ukraine defend itself against Putin’s illegal invasion,” — Brent Leatherwood, Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission President. “This supplemental package includes bills that the CCP, Russia, and the Islamic Republic of Iran all vehemently oppose, it will be devastating to our enemies if this passes,” — POLARIS. “A resilient U.S. DIB and a strong network of U.S. allies and partners form the foundation of U.S. national deterrence in a rapidly evolving strategic environment. On behalf of NDIA’s members, I commend the House leadership for supporting these necessary investments and urge swift passage,” — David Norquist, National Defense Industry Association President. “The bill to force China to divest from TikTok may soon be on the President’s desk. Thank you Speaker Johnson for your leadership,” — Foundation for American Innovation. “FDD Action endorses the supplemental funding package put forward today by Speaker Mike Johnson. We urge members of Congress on both sides of the aisle to support it along with the underlying rule. America’s adversaries are watching. The authoritarian axis of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Russia, and the Chinese Communist Party are challenging U.S. interests like never before. It is imperative that both chambers of the Congress act with urgency to provide critical support to Israel, Taiwan, and Ukraine. These nations are on the front lines of a generation-defining fight for freedom and prosperity, and their success is inextricably linked to our own national security. This legislation paves the way for targeted investments with strong oversight in our allies and partners that will enhance their military capabilities, deter America’s adversaries, and contain the spread of even costlier conflicts,” — Foundation for Defense of Democracies Action. “In supporting U.S. assistance to Ukraine, Israel, and allies in the Indo-Pacific, Speaker Johnson channels President Ronald Reagan. Speaking to Congress in 1985, President Reagan declared, ‘We must stand by all our democratic allies. And we must not break faith with those who are risking their lives,’” — Ronald Reagan Institute. “We should all call our congressmen and urge them to pass aid to stop Putin, to help Israel, to strengthen Taiwan and to close the border. I am especially glad that the REPO act has been included to use Russian money to pay for defeating Putin,” — Former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich. “America is the leader of the free world and I would call on all my old friends in the Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, to rally around Speaker Johnson as he brings legislation to the floor to do America’s part to renew our support for Ukraine, for Israel, for Taiwan, and for freedom in the world,” — Former Vice President Mike Pence."
April 18,David Rouzer,R,N.C.-7,Rouzer Honors National Lineman Appreciation Day with Bipartisan Congressional Resolution,"My first and most important job is serving you. Here are some ways I can help. Congressman Rob Wittman (R-VA), vice chairman of the House Armed Services Committee and chairman of the Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee, held a subcommittee hearing to review the fiscal year 2025 budget request for the Department of Defense’s fixed-wing tactical and training aircraft programs. “While our focus remains on the National Defense Strategy, which prioritizes China as our primary threat, I'm concerned about the lack of clarity in defining our tactical fighter force structure and capabilities,” said Chairman Wittman. “The persistent decrease in fighter force structure and the challenge of delivering affordable replacement aircraft are alarming. Additionally, uncertainties persist in aircraft procurement quantities for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps, particularly regarding the F-35 program. Despite the F-35's promise as the most advanced fighter aircraft, we must expedite TR-3 hardware and Block 4 software deployment to address ongoing challenges.” 
(Watch the full hearing) The hearing addressed the clarity and direction of the U.S. military's currently declining tactical fighter force structure, particularly in light of the National Defense Strategy's emphasis on China as a pacing threat. The subcommittee heard testimony from: Chairman Wittman:  
 “We understand the need to modernize. The key is, we always go through these transitions where we get rid of existing platforms, regardless of their limitations and capabilities and things that they can and cannot do for the promise of new capability somewhere out in the future. And I tell folks ‘All of our dreams come through outside the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP).’ ... We have got to find a way to get those curves to intersect as far as retiring older capability [and] bringing online newer capability. It always seems like there's a bathtub there we have to swim in for years.
 “I know we've had a lot of conversations about F-35, TR-3. It was bitterly disappointing to myself, and other committee members, that we had to learn of another shift to the right to Q3, not directly from the contractor, but from an earnings call.
 “Can you give us your perspective on how you see the path forward? Because the F-35 is it. We are all in on this aircraft. It has to perform. The capabilities that TR-3 brings to the table are necessary and it has to occur at the speed of relevance.
 “I'm not looking to place blame. I think everybody is part of this. Congress has to be part of this as far as not just understanding what happened, but what the solution is going forward. How do you see things going forward to make sure we get back to where we need to be?”
 Lt. Gen. Schmidt: 
 “Honestly, sir, I am getting tired of over-promising and under-delivering, and I need to change that narrative. All that said, just saying it's going to take longer is not going to be satisfying and all the things we talked about earlier with a true digital infrastructure, being a state-of-the-art program for literally the biggest fighter program in the world. It would be unacceptable to be anything else. But I don't feel like that's where we are today. The discussions from industry are all we can do in the future on future programs. There is no future program that is bigger than this program. And so, getting after the development side is the thing that bothers me the most every single day. And those are the things that we're trying to do about it, but I need some help from industry, sir.” 
 Chairman Wittman: 
 “I think things are finally starting to move in the right direction. I appreciate your assertion that we have to have the best on your team there at the Joint Program Office. I appreciate the conversation we had a few days ago to give Lockheed credit that they're saying we're going to make sure we bring subject matter experts across the enterprise because there are other aspects of what Lockheed does that use digital twin technology, that use digital design, that use advanced methods to make sure that we develop systems at the speed of relevance to make sure you get information quickly into comparison computer models to make sure we make those software upgrades. Those are things that have to happen. 
 “Lockheed has made the commitment to do that … the key now is execution.
 “I tell folks, ‘We can talk all about the ground that we've already plowed and talk about how we got here. But the key is, what are we going to do on the path forward?...’I do want to ask the next step forward, so as we begin to deliver these TR-3 configured aircraft, are you confident as to when they are delivered as to where they will be operationally? And will there be additional things that need to be done in the interim, actually get them to be combat coded? Because the thought is when they first come in, they may not be a combat coded status. It looks to me, it may take 12-16 months to get them from the early stages of TR-3 to actually being able to fly within that combat configuration.”
 Lt. Gen. Schmidt: 
 “There are certain capabilities that will not be available in the truncated version of the TR-3 software and you're probably right about the 12 to 16 months. We're looking at everything we can to try to figure out what [we can] move left in that, but that is an accurate assessment, sir, that for a couple of the capabilities that our warfighters feel are required to be fully combat capable they will not be there at the truncation, sir.”
 Chairman Wittman: 
 “I think one of the aspects of this also with NGAD is not just understanding what the future threat scenario would be and what the future countermeasures will be by our adversaries to try to overcome whatever technology would bring to the table, but also to look at [options] like CCA. I think CCA holds a lot of promise for the current aircraft and F-35. As we know, it's meant to be in ancillary, not in place of — but give us your perspective. We talk about the current scenario now moving it to the left getting it out there quickly. But as we advance that particular platform, give me your perspective on what it does to the capability of NGAD.”
 Mr. Hunter: 
 “Our collaborative combat aircraft program is part of the NGAD family system, so it's very much envisioned to be a complementary capability that helps NGAD perform its mission. Having said that, we anticipate, or we project, and we are budgeting towards, fielding of collaborative combat aircraft on a faster time frame. So it is not just NGAD that they would be teaming with. Also, other Air Force systems and joint systems like the F-35.”
 Chairman Wittman: 
 “Do you think what we learn by fielding CCA faster will provide more capability and capacity for NGAD?”
 Mr. Hunter: 
 “Absolutely. It's leveraging that same architecture, that same industry-based partner. It allows us to exercise fielding of technology in a way that will definitely be supportive of us doing the same thing with NGAD.”

April 15,Richard E. Neal,D,Mass.-1,Neal Statement on Tax Day,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, Rep. French Hill’s (AR-02) bill, H.R. 4681, the Illicit Captagon Trafficking Suppression Act, passed the House Floor with a bipartisan vote of 410-13. This legislation would issue new, direct sanctions against the perpetrators who illicitly produce and traffic captagon. “Iran is the primary financer of Hamas and Hezbollah which further fuels their terror partnership with President Bashar al-Assad in Syria. Assad’s murderous regime is propped up by his captagon drug that generates billions in illegal funding and devastates families in the region. “After multiple visits with U.S. government officials and partners in the Middle East last year, it is my view that my required U.S. government-initiated strategy to fight Assad’s production and trafficking of captagon is only in its early stages. We need to have specific sanctions directly targeting individuals and networks associated with the trade of captagon, which is exactly why it is crucial that my bill, the Illicit Captagon Trafficking Suppression Act, passed the House Floor today. The U.S. government and our partners in the region and in Europe must put significant pressure on stopping the proliferation of this dangerous drug which is key to ensuring stability in the region – the passage of my bill is an important next step in our decisive actions to do so.” Further Background: H.R. 4681 - Illicit Captagon Trafficking Suppression Act: This bill would impose new sanctions with respect to illicit captagon trafficking in Syria linked to the Bashar al-Assad regime. H.R. 6265 – Countering Assad’s Proliferation Trafficking And Garnering Of Narcotics (CAPTAGON) Act: This legislation requires the U.S. government to develop an interagency strategy to disrupt and dismantle narcotics production and trafficking and affiliated networks linked to the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria.

April 18,Scott Perry,R,Pa.-10,House GOP blasts ‘joke’ loan to Ukraine in latest blow to Johnson’s foreign aid plan,"

 Congressman Salud Carbajal (CA-24) visited the future site of more than 30 new apartments and a health clinic in downtown Santa Barbara to present Sanctuary Centers and the County of Santa Barbara with the $1,000,000 investment he secured in this year’s federal budget to support the project.
 ""This is an example of great partnerships in action helping to address the Central Coast’s greatest issues,” said Rep. Carbajal. “It tackles housing: 34 new affordable units for Central Coast families, which are much needed. It tackles health: creating a new clinic to address mental health, substance use, and other ailments. And it does both right in the heart of downtown Santa Barbara.”
 “Congressman Carbajal's decisive leadership in securing federal funding to support the construction of 34 units of affordable housing is a beacon of hope for Santa Barbara County,” said Sanctuary Centers President and CEO Barry Schoer. “This funding will have a profound impact on residents with mental illness who wish to live independently while receiving supportive behavioral health services.” “Having an 100% affordable project in the middle of downtown is vital and serves a real need for the many folks in our working class who are working to survive,” said Santa Barbara County Supervisor Das Williams. “We are grateful to Representative Carbajal for his support in securing the Community Project Funding grant to create housing units for the chronically mentally ill,” stated Jesús Armas, Director of the Santa Barbara County Community Services Department. “The residents will receive comprehensive services to address their ongoing mental health needs.  We also thank Barry Schoer and the Sanctuary Centers Board for their vision to expand critical housing and services for the County’s most vulnerable population.” The $1,000,000 in funding that Rep. Carbajal worked to secure in the 2024 federal budget signed into law last month supports the construction of 34 new studio apartments along with an on-site clinic at 115 West Anapamu Street in Santa Barbara. The clinic will give residents access to supportive services for those struggling with mental health, substance abuse, and other health concerns. The mixed-use development will also include 10 units set aside for 24/7 supportive care from the Sanctuary Centers team. Construction on the project began in December 2023. Additional funding for the project was provided by Santa Barbara County, the State of California, and private donations. The funding is part of $13,446,901 secured by Carbajal for 14 Central Coast projects which he championed over the course of the past year’s federal budget negotiations. The projects range from public safety and infrastructure upgrades to water system improvements. In the spring of 2023, Rep. Carbajal began to push for funding for these projects through formal requests to the House Appropriations Committee for Fiscal Year 2024. Rep. Carbajal has previously secured funding for 23 different community projects, totaling nearly $40 million over the past two years. The funding was secured through the Community Project Funding (CPF) initiative first launched in 2022. Projects must be in the public interest, be good uses of taxpayer dollars, and be certified to not conflict with the representative’s personal financial interests.

April 17,Mike Johnson,R,La.-4,House GOP Leadership Statement on Senate Ignoring Constitutional Duty to Hold Mayorkas Impeachment Trial,"Today, Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) Chair Nanette Barragán (CA-44) announced the CHC endorsement of bipartisan legislation written by Congressman Salud Carbajal (CA-24) to increase access to quality child care and lower cost of care for American families. The Child Care Investment Act, which was introduced by Carbajal with Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer (R-OR) last summer, has the support of the Problem Solvers Caucus, the New Democrat Coalition, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Bipartisan Policy Center, and a range of child care advocacy groups. ""The lack of affordable quality child care is hurting Latino families and the American economy – with more than a $120 billion lost every year,” said Chair Nanette Barragán. “A recent study found that as child care costs have risen more than 200% in the last 30 years, more than 3 in every 20 Latino toddlers are living with a family member who quit their job or made a job choice based on their child care options. The Child Care Investment Act recognizes that Congress has not kept up with the child care realities of our nation and of the Latino communities that our caucus represents; and it implements commonsense changes to our tax code to ensure we help families who are struggling to stay afloat while balancing their jobs with the their family’s needs."" “Child care is not just a family issue. It is an economic issue,” said Congressman Carbajal.“I’m proud to earn the support of my colleagues in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus as we continue to see there is growing need for updating our tax code to ensure every Central Coast family can get access to quality, affordable child care. The momentum for this bill is growing, and I’m proud to see more members recognizing this bill as a commonsense way to revise our tax code and support our working families.” The bill is also backed by the First Five Years Fund, Early Care & Education Consortium, Learning Care Group, Save the Children, KinderCare, National Association of Women Business Owners, and the Santa Barbara South Coast Chamber of Commerce, Santa Maria Valley Chamber of Commerce, San Luis Obispo Chamber of Commerce, and Ventura Chamber of Commerce. The Child Care Investment Act improves three existing child care tax incentives to ensure the federal tax code adequately addresses the current realities of child care costs and availability. The bill expands a tax credit aimed at helping businesses provide child care to their workers by increasing the credit’s rate and caps, allowing businesses to jointly create and operate a child care facility for their employees, and adding in-home services as an eligible use. Currently, the Employer-Provided Child Care Credit only allows for a business to receive tax credits for contracting with an existing child care provider or creating their own facility. The bill doubles the amount of money that can be saved by a family in a tax-exempt Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account (DCAP) to cover child care expenses up to $10,000 annually, more accurately reflecting the average cost of child care in the U.S. The bill also allows an additional $2,000 in DCAP savings per each additional dependent. The current $5,000 annual cap has remained unchanged since the 1980s, when the dependent care savings account was first created.The bipartisan proposal also improves the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit, an existing tax write-off for Americans to offset child care expenses. The current rates would be increased for all eligible incomes, with a family with two children eligible to get up to $3,000 in credits for child care expenses. The bill would also make the credit fully refundable and index the bill’s increased tax credits to inflation. A more detailed summary of the bill proposed tax credit changes can be found HERE. The inspiration for this bill came from roundtables held by Rep. Carbajal in July 2022 discussing the impacts of inflation with small business owners in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo County, who conveyed that child care was one of their top concerns when it came to current business and hiring conditions.

April 17,Mike Johnson,R,La.-4,Speaker Johnson: “We’ve Improved the Process and the Policy”,"Today, Rep. Jim Banks introduced the American Students First Act, legislation to prohibit the Education Department from allowing illegal immigrants to participate in the TRIO program, a collection of eight federally funded and administered college prep programs for low-income Americans, first generation college students, and students with disabilities. You can find the full bill text here and coverage of the bill from Breitbart here. Said Rep. Jim Banks: “It’s disgusting and un-American that the Biden admin wants to use tax dollars from truckers and farmers to fund college prep classes for illegal immigrants. All the while, our test scores are at a record low. Rather than prepping illegals for college, the Biden admin should focus on undoing the unprecedented learning loss that happened during their school lockdowns.” Earlier this year, Biden’s Department of Education announced a proposal to expand eligibility for three TRIO programs to non-citizens who attended high school in the United States. This proposal follows their decision last year to grant waivers for California and Oregon to allow illegal immigrants to participate in federal funded TRIO programs in those states. In addition to establishing citizenship requirements for eligibility, Banks’ legislation would prohibit waivers for illegal immigrants.

April 19,Mike Johnson,R,La.-4,"What They’re Saying: Conservatives, Faith Leaders, Advocacy Organizations Support House National Security Supplemental Legislation","Today, Anti Woke Caucus Chairman Rep. Jim Banks introduced the Defund NPR Act, legislation to defund National Public Radio. This initiative is supported by Elon Musk. Find the bill text here. Said Rep. Jim Banks: “NPR’s new CEO is a radical, left-wing activist who doesn’t believe in free speech or objective journalism. Hoosiers shouldn’t be writing her paychecks. Katherine Maher isn’t qualified to teach an introductory journalism class, much less capable of responsibly spending millions of American tax dollars. NPR was a liberal looney bin under the last CEO John Lansing, and it’s about to get even nuttier. It’s time to pull the plug on this national embarrassment. Congress must stop spending other people’s hard-earned money on low grade propaganda.” In 2019, NPR published an erroneous “correction” after Congressman Banks correctly stated that Adam Schiff lied about his relationship with Ukraine “whistleblower” Eric Ciaramella during an on-air interview. According to a recent report from Real Clear Investigations, Mr. Ciaramella accompanied then-Vice President Biden on his trip to Ukraine in 2015, at which the former Vice President demanded the Ukrainian government fire prosecutor Victor Shokin. A recent piece from now-former NPR editor Uri Berliner brought public attention to the outlet’s longstanding partisan bias. For example, NPR’s Washington, D.C., news team includes 87 registered Democrats and zero registered Republicans. Katherine Maher, NPR’s recently appointed CEO, has described the First Amendment as “the number one challenge” to combatting “misinformation,” and has attacked former President Donald Trump on social media on several occasions.     Use the form below to sign up for my newsletter and get the latest news and updates directly to your inbox."
April 17,Robert J. Wittman,R,Va.-1,Wittman Chairs Hearing on 2025 Budget Request for the Department of Defense’s Fixed-Wing Tactical and Training Aircraft Programs,"WASHINGTON, DC – Today, Congresswoman Lori Trahan (MA-03), a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s Health Subcommittee, secured a commitment from U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, the nation’s top health official, to work with Massachusetts leaders as they continue responding to the Steward Health Care crisis. CLICK HERE or the image below to watch Trahan’s full line of questioning.


 “Steward is facing a ‘significant cash crunch’ because of blatant mismanagement by company executives who have rewarded themselves with multi-million-dollar salaries while accruing massive debts. Unsurprisingly, Steward has failed repeatedly – including in response to requests from myself and my colleagues in the Massachusetts delegation – to provide transparency regarding its intentions to maintain the operation of their nine hospitals in our home state,” Congresswoman Trahan said. “Mr. Secretary, many of the hardworking families I represent just want to know that their government is paying attention to this issue and taking action to keep their hospitals open. I’m hoping I can count on you to maintain a line of communication with Massachusetts leaders to ensure that every possible action is taken and resource is available to keep community hospitals like Holy Family Hospital open and serving patients.” “Congresswoman, we will do everything we can,” Secretary Becerra responded. “We are ready to work with Massachusetts to make sure health care is available to communities.”  Last December, Steward announced plans to close Mt. Sinai hospital in Stoughton, the latest move by the company that also sold all of its facilities in Utah and closed Texas Vista Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas in 2023. A month later, the company it sold all of its Massachusetts properties to in 2016, Medical Properties Trust, announced that it would begin taking steps to claw back overdue rent payments from Steward, including the possible sale of some or all of its nine hospitals in the Commonwealth. In March, Steward announced that the corporation had reached a deal to sell its physician network to Optum pending regulatory approval. Last week, the Massachusetts delegation wrote to the DOJ and FTC requesting that they scrutinize the proposed sale of Steward’s physician group to Optum. In February, Trahan led the introduction of bipartisan legislation to direct additional federal funding to local, nonprofit safety net hospitals that would be directly impacted by the closure of or service cuts at Steward facilities in Massachusetts. During a January congressional hearing, Trahan slammed Steward’s private equity business model citing its track record of acquiring community hospitals, maximizing profits and cutting services, and then closing or selling what is left of the facility. --------------------------------- Congresswoman Lori Trahan Remarks as Delivered House Health Subcommittee Hearing on “Fiscal Year 2025 Department Of Health And Human Services Budget” April 17, 2024 Trahan: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It’s great to see you, Secretary Becerra. As you and I have discussed before, community hospitals around the country are facing significant financial challenges, and in my home state of Massachusetts, those challenges are being made worse by a private equity corporation that has prioritized profits over patients – and jeopardized the future of the nine hospitals it owns in the process. Mr. Secretary, as we speak, Steward Health Care – the largest for-profit, private equity backed health network in the country – is creating a health care crisis in working-class communities across Massachusetts, just as it did when it drove Texas Vista Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas into closure last year, when it was forced to sell off its hospitals in Utah just months earlier. Steward is facing a “significant cash crunch” because of blatant mismanagement by company executives who have rewarded themselves with multi-million-dollar salaries while accruing massive debts. Unsurprisingly, Steward has failed repeatedly – including in response to requests from myself and my colleagues in the Massachusetts delegation – to provide transparency regarding its intentions to maintain the operation of their nine hospitals in our home state. So instead, it announced the sale of its physician group to Optum, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, while providing no insight into the future of the hospitals their physicians practice in or what the proposed sale will mean for vulnerable patients. So Mr. Secretary, many of the hardworking families I represent just want to know that their government is paying attention to this issue and taking action to keep their hospitals open. I’m hoping I can count on you to maintain a line of communication with Massachusetts leaders to ensure that every possible action is taken and resource is available to keep community hospitals like Holy Family Hospital open and serving patients. Becerra: Congresswoman, we will do everything we can. This is actually a question more appropriate for me when I was Attorney General because we tried to take on some of these, I mean, they’re vicious investors that try to gut the assets out of an institution, and they just sort of run out of dodge. I can’t tell you that we have authority because we don’t govern the licensing of hospitals and so forth at the federal level. That’s all state. But we are ready to work with Massachusetts to make sure health care is available to communities. Trahan: I appreciate that, and I am encouraged by recent work your department has done in collaboration with the Department of Justice and the FTC regarding the effects of corporate ownership trends in health care, and my colleagues and I plan to submit comments as part of that process. This year, I’m spearheading efforts to commission a GAO study on hospital closures in the last decade to identify the ownership models that have closed and assess the impact of those closures on their communities. This type of study has been conducted for rural hospitals but not on a broader scale. If you could just speak a little bit to how improved transparency regarding hospital closures will help the agency to effectively address, respond to, and mitigate future community hospital closures, that would be great. Becerra: Yeah we’re actually doing something similar to that with nursing homes. We are tired of seeing nursing homes that get bought up – usually they’re owned by mom and pop people who start them up for, you know, wanting to help the community. Then they get bought up, and before you know it, you can’t trace back who the actual owner is. So, now we are requiring nursing homes to provide information on who the actual owners are, because they set up so many LLCs, so many different sham corporations, it’s tough to get to the bottom of it. Then when they run out of town after they gut the assets, people are left wondering what happened. So we would love to work with you on being able to have more transparency in the health care sector. Trahan: Thank you. I do believe that we can agree that as we address closures and acquisitions that don’t benefit patients, that it’s crucial to distinguish corporate, for-profit hospitals from their nonprofit peers. I introduced bipartisan legislation with Congressman David Valadao to establish a federal designation for Essential Hospitals. And I hope my colleagues on the committee will support this legislation. I hope to work with you Mr. Secretary to better support the essential health systems that all of our communities depend on for lifesaving care. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. ### "
April 18,Robert J. Wittman,R,Va.-1,Wittman Congratulates Winners of VA-01 Congressional App Challenge,"WASHINGTON, DC – Today, Congresswoman Lori Trahan (MA-03), a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s Innovation, Data, and Commerce Subcommittee, highlighted necessary areas of improvement in the discussion draft of the American Privacy Rights Act (APRA), a bipartisan privacy package agreed to by House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA-05) and Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee Chair Maria Cantwell (D-WA). CLICK HERE or the image below to watch Trahan’s full line of questioning. 



 One of the bills discussed in today’s hearing was Trahan’s bipartisan, bicameral Data Elimination and Limiting Extensive Tracking and Exchange (DELETE) Act, which would establish a system through which individuals could request that all data brokers delete any personal data collected by the company and prohibit future collection. The current privacy discussion draft put forward by committee would allow Americans to request that data brokers stop future collection of their data but does not give them the right to have previously collected data deleted. “The DELETE Act, which I introduced with Congressman Chuck Edwards and Senators Bill Cassidy and Jon Ossoff, would give every American the right to have data brokers delete their data and prohibit future collection. This is a commonsense proposal that’s been discussed before in this committee because of the national security concerns with the way data brokers harvest and sell some of our most sensitive data to the highest bidder, including our foreign adversaries,” Congresswoman Trahan said. “Provisions of the DELETE Act were included in the privacy package that was advanced overwhelmingly out of this committee last Congress. However, I’m concerned that some of the changes to those provisions in the American Privacy Rights Act discussion draft will not fully meet the needs of American users.” Trahan also pushed for stronger transparency provisions in APRA, including mandating requirements for large technology companies to allow independent researchers to analyze the content moderation, algorithmic, and design actions on platforms to understand impacts on users and compliance with federal laws. Trahan has repeatedly pushed for increased researcher access, including by introducing the Digital Services Oversight and Safety Act that would create an Office of Independent Research Facilitation at the Federal Trade Commission to oversee a system through which independent researchers can study the impacts of covered platforms and their content moderation practices, product design decisions, and algorithms. “It’s essential to privacy and kids’ safety online that large data holders are transparent about their business practices and are held accountable by third parties. The best way to do that is to require that qualified researchers are able to study how the decisions made by powerful online platforms are complying with the privacy laws we hope to pass in this committee and impacting users,” Congresswoman Trahan continued. “I’ve been working with Senator Coons on language to empower researchers to take a look under the hood of powerful online companies like Meta and Google in a way that allows them to do their work while protecting user privacy and intellectual property.” During her line of questioning, Trahan applauded inclusion of her TLDR Act in the hearing and provisions of the bill in the bipartisan privacy framework. The TLDR Act, which she introduced with Senators Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and Ben Ray Lujan (D-NM), would require that online companies make their terms of service contracts more accessible, transparent, and understandable for consumers. A 2012 study found that it would take 76 work days for the average American to read the agreements for the websites and platforms they routinely use, and a 2022 poll found that nearly 9 out of every 10 Americans have agreed to a company’s terms of service without reading the contract first. ### "
April 16,French Hill,R,Ark.-2,RELEASE: REP. HILL’S BILL TO IMPOSE NEW SANCTIONS ON ASSAD’S PROLIFERATION OF CAPTAGON PASSES THE HOUSE,"WASHINGTON, DC – Today, Congresswoman Lori Trahan (MA-03) and Congressman Robert Garcia (CA-42) introduced legislation to designate April 17, 2025 as Cabodian Genocide Remembrance Day to recognize the 50th anniversary of the fall of Phnom Penh to the Khmer Rouge, which went on to murder nearly 2 million Camodians. “Today, we mark the solemn anniversary of the start of the Cambdian genocide that saw nearly two million innocent citizens murdered at the hands of the Khmer Rouge regime. By dedicating this day as Cambodian Genocide Remembrance Day, we commit to never forgetting the atrocities committed, to cherishing the lives that were ended far too soon, and to continuing the hard work necessary to ensure it never happens again,” said Congresswoman Trahan, Chair of the Congressional Cambodia Caucus. “There is strong support in Congress for the Cambodian people, and we will continue to reaffirm America’s commitment to the upholding of human rights and democratic values in Cambodia.” “On the 49th anniversary of the Cambodian genocide, we honor the two million lives taken by the Khmer Rouge regime and the hundreds of thousands still in diaspora. This atrocity will never be forgotten. America will always stand in solidarity with the Cambodian people and will always be a safe haven for those who have suffered under violence and tyranny,” said Congressman Garcia. From 1975 to 1979, the Khmer Rouge and its leader Pol Pot engaged in a brutal, systematic genocide of innocent Cambodian citizens. By the time the Khmer Rouge was toppled, nearly 2 million Cambodians were killed, totaling almost 25 percent of the nation’s population. Thousands fled the killing fields for refugee camps in Thailand before being admitted to several nations, including the United States. Today, multiple communities are home to strong, vibrant Cambodia-American populations, including Lowell, Massachusetts and Long Beach, California. In 2019, Lowell, Long Beach, and Los Angeles passed resolutions proclaiming April 17th as Cambodian Genocide Remembrance Day. In 2023, the Massachusetts legislature passed legislation authored by State Representative Vanna Howard, the first Cambodian American woman elected to a state legislature in the nation, and supported by State Representative Rady Mom, the first Cambodian American elected to a state legislature, to do the same. “Today marks the 49th anniversary of the Cambodian genocide, when the Khmer Rouge took control of Cambodia and murdered close to 2 million Cambodians over the next four years, including many of my most precious family members,” said State Representative Howard. “The remembrance is certainly an important acknowledgement of all the survivors in our community. While we recommit ourselves to never forget the lives lost, we must also remain dedicated to ensuring that such an event never happens again, and that Cambodia will return to a free and fair democratic society, sooner than later. As a genocide survivor, I’m very proud the Massachusetts Legislature, for the first time in the history of Massachusetts, passed a House Resolution proclaiming April 17th as Cambodian Genocide Remembrance Day last year, and I’m pleased to see Congresswoman Trahan filing similar legislation at the federal level.” “As a survivor of the savage Khmer Rouge Genocide, who has the privilege of representing many other survivors in the Massachusetts House of Representatives, our history and our pain must never be forgotten. This resolution acknowledges the resiliency of the Cambodian people who survived this historic atrocity and pays respect to the all too many lives that were lost. I commend Congresswoman Lori Trahan for taking the lead on this important resolution,” said State Representative Mom. Last year, Trahan and Congressman Chris Smith (R-NJ-04), as well as Senator Edward J. Markey (D-MA), reintroduced the Cambodia Democracy and Human Rights Act, bipartisan and bicameral legislation to hold the Cambodian government accountable for abuses and corruption that undermine democracy and human rights. Lowell is home to the second largest Cambodian community and the largest Cambodian population per capita of any city or town in the nation. The strong Cambodian American community in the region has strengthened the local economy and contributed mightily to Lowell’s cultural resurgence. It has also been essential in the election of the first Cambodian American mayor, Sokhary Chau, and Cambodian American members of the Lowell City Council, Vesna Nuon and Paul Ratha Yem. “While many Cambodian Americans came to this country to escape political persecution and genocide, we have found much more than a safehaven against these evils. We have found a home and communities that have embraced us and celebrated our culture,” said Councilor Chau. “The Cambodian diaspora is grateful for the leadership of Congresswoman Lori Trahan and Congressman Robert Garcia for recognizing April 17th as Cambodian Genocide Remembrance Day.  By marking this day as Cambodian Genocide Remembrance Day, we honor the lives of those fallen and celebrate the accomplishments and the perseverance of those who have persevered. I'm proud to support this legislation to pay tribute to not only the survivors of the Cambodian Genocide, but also their children and grandchildren who are a testament to our people's resiliency and the promise of our future.” “Cambodian Genocide is a part of history that should never be forgotten, and marking the date will ensure that it is not. Even more important is acknowledging that Cambodia still bears the wounds of that era. While the government is no longer committing mass killings, it is silencing the voices that would cry out for democracy, and they are doing so through both incarceration and exile. Cambodia will not be free until the people have a say in how their country is run, until a government by the people is realized,” said Councilor Nuon. “It's been forty nine years since the fall of Cambodia on April 17, 1975 and the death of almost 2 million Cambodians including my entire family under the hands of Khmer Rouge Pol Pot. The pain is still raw and the hurt remains of being the only survivor of my entire family. One consolation is that I continue to tell the story of what happened in Cambodia during the four years of genocidal reign of the Khmer Rouge regime,” said Councilor Yem.

April 16,French Hill,R,Ark.-2,RELEASE: REP. HILL’S LEGISLATION TO PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY INTO FINANCIAL CORRUPTION OF IRANIAN LEADERS PASSES HOUSE,"WASHINGTON, DC – Today, Congresswoman Lori Trahan (MA-03), a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s Health Subcommittee, was joined by Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Edward J. Markey (D-MA) as well as Representatives Katherine Clark (MA-05), James P. McGovern (MA-02), Ayanna Pressley (MA-07), Stephen F. Lynch (MA-08), Jake Auchincloss (MA-04), Seth Moulton (MA-06), and William R. Keating (MA-09) in writing to the leaders of private equity-owned Steward Health Care and UnitedHealth Group requesting answers on the future of care in Massachusetts following the proposed sale of Steward’s physician group, Stewardship Health, to UnitedHealth-owned Optum Health. “Since Optum’s proposal to buy Stewardship, we have been contacted by both consumers and physicians with concerns about the potential impact on access to affordable, in-network care,” the lawmakers wrote. “In July 2023, UnitedHealth reported that Optum Health posted a 6.4 percent operating margin in the second quarter — the lowest since 2012.3 This has raised concern that the acquisition of more physicians may be an attempt to offset these lower margins, potentially compromising the autonomy of physicians who may be pressured to prioritize efficiency over personalized care.” Last December, Steward announced plans to close Mt. Sinai hospital in Stoughton, the latest move by the company that also sold all of its facilities in Utah and closed Texas Vista Medical Center in San Antonio in 2023. A month later, the company it sold all of its Massachusetts properties to in 2016, Medical Properties Trust, announced that it would be taking steps to claw back overdue rent payments from Steward, including the possible sale of some or all of its nine hospitals in the Commonwealth. In March, Steward announced that the corporation had reached a deal to sell its physician network to Optum pending regulatory approval. Just weeks before the proposed sale was announced, Optum’s parent company, UnitedHealth, became the subject of a federal antitrust investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC). UnitedHealth owns the largest health insurer in the United States while Optum employs the largest physician network in the nation, totaling 90,000 physicians and making up 10 percent of the physician workforce in the United States. “The absorption of doctor practices is part of a vast, accelerating consolidation of medical care, leaving patients in the hands of a shrinking number of giant companies or hospital groups,” the lawmakers continued. On Wednesday, Trahan secured a commitment from U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, the nation’s top health official, to work with Massachusetts leaders as they continue responding to the Steward Health Care crisis. Last week, the Massachusetts delegation wrote to the DOJ and FTC requesting that they scrutinize the proposed sale of Steward’s physician group to Optum.

The lawmakers requested answers to the following questions by April 26th: a.    How many new physicians will Optum acquire in Massachusetts if the sale is completed? a.    Which specific debt-holders will be repaid, and in what order? b.    Will the acquisition result in any changes to the terms and conditions of the leases that MPT currently holds on the hospitals’ real estate? a.    Will Optum allow them to remain as members of these networks under the same terms and conditions?   b.    If so, for how long will Optum guarantee that these networks are retained? a.    Please provide a copy of the Letter of Intent signed between Steward and Optum for the sale of Stewardship Health.

April 17,French Hill,R,Ark.-2,RELEASE: REP. HILL APPLAUDS PASSAGE OF FINTECH BILLS OUT OF HOUSE FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Rep. Earl L. ""Buddy"" Carter today reflected on the life and legacy of beloved Georgian Kevin ""Catfish"" Jackson. Kevin will be remembered not just as a college football champion, but also as a community leader whose hard-work, leadership, and service blessed lives both in Savannah and throughout the broader Georgia community.  Watch Rep. Carter's speech honoring Kevin ""Catfish"" Jackson here: ""I rise today to commemorate the life of my dear friend Kevin 'Catfish' Jackson.
 ""Kevin grew up in Cartersville, Georgia. Those who knew him recognized his talent and motivated him to pursue a future in athletics and academics. He actually wanted to quit high school and wanted to become a lineman for Georgia Power. His coaches saw his athletic ability and encouraged him to continue on, and he did.
 ""He'll be remembered, among many things, as being a member of the 1980 University of Georgia National Championship football team. He played under Coach Vince Dooley and Coach Erk Russell. In fact, Coach Russell told the story about how he got his nickname Catfish. Some people say it was because Coach said he fought like a cat, and he drank like a fish. Coach also said that it might have been because one day in practice he was waddling around in the mud and looked like a catfish.
 ""Due to his dedication, his teamwork, and his love for the sport, he was voted by his teammates as co-captain for the Georgia Bulldogs in 1983. Later, he was selected by his coaches for the Coach Wally Butts Award for 'the player who pays the price' – a title that recognized his willingness to sacrifice for others without any ends.
 ""After graduating with a degree in Business Education, Kevin moved to the city of Savannah – my hometown – and he became a very prominent businessman and a very important member of our community.
 ""He applied what he learned both in the classroom and on the field to his business ventures, and he earned a reputation for treating staff with the respect that he hoped to receive in return.
 ""His sales career started in 1985. He first worked as a salesman for the Georgia Fastener and Safety Company in Savannah. Then, he went on to serve as Vice President of Marketing at Scapa Group.
 ""In 1999, he founded his own business – EnviroVac Holdings – a company committed to environmental and industrial cleaning services. As President and CEO, he successfully expanded his company across the Southeastern region of the nation.
 ""Kevin was a man of many passions. He lived life like he was. He lived life big.
 ""He was known for giving his all in everything he worked on.
 ""He served as Chairman of the Savannah Economic Development Authority. He served on the Board of Directors for the Georgia Ports Authority, the Georgia Economic Development Authority, the Lottery, and so much more.
 ""Despite his many obligations, he always looked out for his community, and his strong faith guided him tirelessly to serve others.
 ""He lent his talents to many wonderful organizations including the Alzheimer's Association, Bethesda Academy, CASA, Leukemia Society, Cure for Cancer, Feed the Hungry, United Way, YMCA, and Savannah Christian Prep School.
 ""And I would be remiss if I did not mention his involvement in the organization of the Band of Brothers. In fact, for a while, we met at his business. The Band of Brothers is a prayer group – a Bible study – that meets every week on Friday mornings at 6:30. Kevin was a big part of getting that started.
 ""He was always there when you needed him, both in his career and his personal endeavors. His heart was always filled with gratitude, and his personality brought joy to all he met.
 ""More than anything, he loved his family. I loved following him on Instagram, seeing all the different posts that he would have enjoying his grandchildren. He even built them a zoo, practically a zoo – a farm with all the farm animals.
 ""Words cannot express the profound impact that Catfish has left on his community. He'll be missed, but his career and his service have created a legacy that will never be forgotten.
 ""The Savannah and broader Georgia community are praying for Kevin's family. His memory will live on in our hearts forever.
 ""We suffered a great void in our community with the loss of Kevin 'Catfish' Jackson, but his memory will live on forever.""

April 18,French Hill,R,Ark.-2,"RELEASE: REP. HILL INTRODUCES LEGISLATION PROVIDE FAIRNESS, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND TRANSPARENCY TO THE BANK PROCESS","WASHINGTON, D.C. – Reps. Earl L. “Buddy” Carter (R-GA) and Andrew Clyde (R-GA) today introduced a resolution declaring April 16th, the day after Tax Day, as FairTax Day.  
H.R. 25, the FairTax Act, is a bill that would replace the current tax code with a national consumption tax, eliminating both the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Tax Day. By establishing a national FairTax Day, to come directly after the United States’ traditional Tax Day, this resolution signals a readiness to begin a new, fair process that gives the people power over their paychecks.
 
“Americans spend over six billion hours per year filing their taxes. Instead of putting your hard-earned dollars straight into Uncle Sam’s pocket, the FairTax allows you to keep 100% of your paycheck and choose how much you pay in taxes every year. It is a simple, fair, and preferred alternative to the current system, which punishes success and puts unelected bureaucrats in charge of your paycheck. Let’s make April 15, 2024, our last Tax Day ever. It’s time for a change, and FairTax Day will raise awareness about this popular, Georgia-grown proposal,” said Rep. Carter. 
 
“The FairTax would not only create a simplified and fair tax code for all Americans but would also foster economic prosperity and eliminate the need for the IRS, which has become weaponized. As a staunch supporter of Rep. Carter’s FairTax Act, I’m proud to join my fellow Georgian in raising awareness of this commonsense legislation by introducing a resolution to recognize April 16th as FairTax Day,” said Rep. Clyde.
 
First introduced into the U.S. Congress in 1999 by former Georgia Congressman John Linder, the FairTax is the leading tax reform movement in the country. This proposal would abolish all personal and corporate income taxes, the death tax, gift taxes, and the payroll tax, eliminating the need for the IRS. The FairTax would repeal the current tax code and replace it with a single national consumption tax that is pro-growth and allows Americans to keep every cent of their hard-earned money. It is the only tax system that is simple, efficient, friendly to economic growth, non-discriminatory, unintrusive, and FAIR.

April 19,French Hill,R,Ark.-2,RELEASE: REP. HILL PRESSES CFPB TO COMPLY WITH COURT ORDER AND PROVIDE RELIEF TO SMALL BUSINESSES,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Rep. Earl L. “Buddy” Carter (R-GA) took to the House floor today to deliver remarks in favor of H.R. 6406, the Stand Against Houthi Aggression Act, which he is proud to cosponsor.  
H.R. 6406 would reinstate sanctions placed on the Iran-backed Houthis during the Trump Administration and redesignate the group as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.
 
Watch and read Rep. Carter's remarks here:
 “Quite frankly Mr. Speaker, I am appalled that I have to say this, but the President of the United States has emboldened Iran to attack our greatest ally in the Middle East, and the only democracy in that region, Israel.  
“In February of 2021, the Biden Administration removed the Houthis from the U.S. list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations.
 
“This was a terrible, terrible misjudgment that mirrors this administration’s complete lack of authority on issues of national and international security.
 
“Iranian-backed terrorist organizations have repeatedly, repeatedly proven that they will carry out the Iranian regime’s radical Islamic ideology to no ends. This weekend was a sobering reminder of that.
 
“It’s time to hold Iran and its proxies accountable for their actions. This requires that the U.S. take a firmer stance against Iran’s state-sponsored terrorism.
 
“The Stand Against Houthi Aggression Act places the Houthis back onto the list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations – where they should have been all along - and it imposes immediate, immediate sanctions on any individual associated with the group.
 
“If President Biden refuses to lead, I hope this body will step up in his absence to fight against antisemitism and state-sponsored terrorism.
 
“Anything less than that, Mr. Speaker, is unacceptable.”

April 16,Salud Carbajal,D,Calif.-24,"Rep. Carbajal Highlights Securing $1,000,000 Investment for New Housing Options, Health Clinic in Downtown Santa Barbara","Washington, D.C. – On Wednesday, Rep. Ralph Norman (SC-05) reintroduced the Earmark Elimination Act. The Earmark Elimination Act would permanently ban federal earmarks. Background An earmark is an item in appropriations bills or large spending packages that designates money for a specific special interest group or project while avoiding the typical merit-based or competitive award process for federal funding. Prior to 2011, earmarks had become a frequent source of corruption and furthering of personal agendas by Members of Congress. In 2011, Congress passed a temporary ban on earmarks, which every session of Congress has since renewed. However, earmarks have returned and have been used by countless Members since Fiscal Year 2022. As first reported by Virginia Allen in the Daily Signal, Rep. Norman's bill would create a permanent federal ban on earmarks in the House of Representatives. This is the only way to limit the cost and impact of earmarks, as well as the corruption which comes with appropriating money to pet-projects simply to buy votes in Congress. With the U.S. $34 trillion in debt, Congress should not be putting taxpayers on the hook for frivolous handouts to politically connected friends. This bill is co-sponsored by Rep. Scott Perry (PA-10), Rep. Matt Rosendale (MT-02), Rep. Tom Tiffany (WI-07), Rep. Tom McClintock (CA-05), Rep. Andy Ogles (TN-05), Rep. Bob Good (VA-05), and Rep. Victoria Spartz (IN-05). This bill has the support of the National Taxpayer Union, Advancing American Freedom, and Heritage Action. Statements ""The use and abuse of earmarks by Members on both sides of the political aisle is appalling,"" said Rep. Norman in a statement on Wednesday. ""I will continue to reintroduce this bill to kill earmarks each Congress until others take it seriously. We owe that much to the taxpayers who we work for."" ""Taxpayers are fed up with earmarks and special interest spending. That is why the National Taxpayers Union is pleased to support Rep. Ralph Norman's Earmark Elimination Act, which would permanently ban earmarks. Getting deficits under control should be the top priority of Congress and cutting low-hanging fruit like earmarks should be the first step in a comprehensive process to balance the budget,"" said the National Taxpayers Union. ""Earmarks have always been wasteful. But today, they're increasingly wicked too: funding abortion facilities, antisemitic groups, and organizations that trans kids behind their parents' backs. Bringing earmarks back was a terrible idea. Congress must pass the Earmark Elimination Act immediately,"" said Paul Teller, Executive Director of Advancing American Freedom.   For questions about Rep.

                 We will not share your email address with anyone Congressmen Glenn Grothman (R-WI) and Ed Case (D-HI) have introduced the bipartisan Stop the Baseline Bloat Act. This legislation aims to ensure a more honest accounting of what the federal government plans to spend by removing emergency spending from the baseline budget. According to the Cato Institute, a public policy research organization, Congress has designated $12 trillion in spending for emergencies over the past 30 years. The current practice of including emergency spending in the CBO baseline budget on an annual basis skews the baseline budget toward higher spending, distorting the fiscal outlook, and contributing to the dire fiscal state of our country. This bill has received strong support by a coalition including Citizens Against Government Waste, Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, FreedomWorks, Heritage Action, National Taxpayers Union, and Taxpayers Protection Alliance and is cosponsored by Michael Cloud (R-TX), Nancy Mace (R-SC), Ralph Norman (R-SC), Andy Ogles (R-TN), and Randy Weber (R-TX). ""Inflation has reached outrageous levels over the past several years, and the federal government bears responsibility for it,” said Congressman Glenn Grothman. “This bill will greatly impact the American people by increasing the transparency between the government and the citizens. The CBO cannot continue to create a budget baseline that justifies outrageous spending levels. Getting the country’s fiscal house in order starts with an unbiased CBO baseline.” ""The path out of our growing budget crisis starts with accurate and transparent budgets,” said Congressman Ed Case (HI-01). “A budget that inflates prior year spending to conceal real growth year-to-year is neither accurate nor transparent. Our measure would eliminate these budgetary tricks that conceal our dangerous journey into fiscal irresponsibility.” “Erroneous spending is a byproduct of flawed math in D.C. Adding emergency spending to long-tern investments is like including your emergency fund in your monthly income. Removing it from the Congressional Budget Office baseline is a crucial step to stop flawed calculations that justify D.C.’s spending problem,” said Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC) “The current CBO baseline treats temporary emergency appropriations as permanent and growing expenditures, baking in a bias of higher spending and undermining guardrails that emergency spending is intended to respond to necessary, sudden, urgent, unforeseen, and not permanent situations. The Stop the Baseline Bloat Act would remove emergency and other supplemental appropriations from the discretionary spending baseline, increasing transparency, such that when Congress decides to rely on emergency and supplemental funding to increase topline levels, a spending increase gets scored as such.” - Romina Boccia, Director of Budget and Entitlement Policy, Cato Institute “The Stop Baseline Bloat Act would help restore fiscal restraint in the budgeting process by stripping out the cost of emergency and supplemental appropriations from the CBO baseline. As is evident from the designation of their purpose, such legislation is not meant to have a permanent impact on the budget by inflating the amount of future spending."" - Tom Schatz, President, Council for Citizens Against Government Waste “The Congressional Budget Office’s baseline is filled with distortions, many of which are required by law, that drive spending higher. Rep. Grothman’s Stop the Baseline Bloat Act would help fix this problem by removing the assumption that one-time emergency appropriations are repeated each year in the baseline – a distortion that effectively bakes ‘emergency’ spending into the baseline for future spending.”- Brittany Madni, Executive Vice President of the Economic Policy Innovation Center (EPIC) “NTU is pleased to support Rep. Glenn Grothman's 'Stop the Baseline Bloat Act,' which would remove emergency spending from the CBO baseline. Under current scoring conventions, these temporary, one-time expenditures inflate the baseline, pushing spending ever higher. This legislation will help Congress tackle our nation's top fiscal problem: our out-of-control debt."" -- Brandon Arnold, Executive Vice President, National Taxpayers Union “TPA is proud to support Rep. Grothman’s Stop the Baseline Bloat Act. The CBO’s baseline budget calculations should not include emergency spending and supplemental appropriations, nor increase them each year with inflation. Emergency spending is inherently a temporary measure, not spread out over 10 years. Removing this simple bias from the baseline budget will lower spending and promote long-term fiscal responsibility.” - David Williams, President, Taxpayers Protection Alliance  ""One-time emergency spending can artificially inflate the baseline produced by the Congressional Budget Office, creating the opportunity for lawmakers to use fake savings as an offset. We appreciate the efforts of Representative Glenn Grothman (R-WI) to improve the budget process and provide greater transparency by removing emergency spending from CBO's baseline."" – Maya MacGuineas, President of the Committee for a Reasonable Federal Budget -30- U.S. Rep.

April 16,Jim Banks,R,Ind.-3,Banks Introduces American Students First Act,"Washington, D.C. — Today, during a hearing in the prominent Energy and Commerce Committee's Health Subcommittee on “Examining Health Sector Cybersecurity,” Congresswoman Annie Kuster (NH-02) urged her colleagues to support the millions of Americans whose data was exposed and compromised by the Change Healthcare cyberattack in February 2024. “The Change Healthcare cyberattack not only disrupted timely care for patients in New Hampshire and beyond, it also exposed their private data to misuse by malicious actors,” said Kuster. “I’m deeply concerned about the amount of patient data that has reportedly been compromised—Congress must act to support consumers and patients impacted by this breach while we continue working to prevent these kinds of attacks in the future.” Cyberattacks targeting U.S. health care systems have affected millions of Americans. In January and February of 2023 alone, the data of 74 million Americans was leaked on the dark web. The attack on Change Healthcare impacted every hospital in New Hampshire, though it is unclear how many patients’ data may have been compromised.  As a co-chair of the Bipartisan Rural Broadband Caucus, Kuster is a fierce advocate for empowering rural communities with the resources they need to invest in their cybersecurity infrastructure and protect patient data.  ###"
April 19,Jim Banks,R,Ind.-3,Rep. Banks Introduces the Defund NPR Act,"Washington, D.C. — Today, House Assistant Minority Leader Joe Neguse was joined by leaders from every corner of the Democratic Caucus in a press conference calling out the draconian cuts proposed in the Republican Study Committee’s (RSC) backward budget. Supported by an overwhelming number of House Republicans and 100% of their leadership, the RSC’s 2025 budget would put a stop to critical programs American families rely on, gutting Social Security and Medicare. The Assistant Leader was joined by Representatives Brendan F. Boyle (PA-02), John Larson (CT-01), Pramila Jayapal (WA-07), Annie Kuster (NH-02), and Jan Schakowsky (IL-09).  Congressman Neguse and the participating members pointed to recent reports stating that Americans across the political spectrum are concerned by the RSC’s budget proposal with 55% of Republicans, 70% of Independents, and 92% of Democrats finding the suggested cuts concerning. Neguse’s opening remarks are as follows:  Assistant Leader Neguse: “Good morning. Thank you everyone for being here this morning. Week after week, House Republicans have continued to prove just how out of step they are with the priorities of the American people. Embroiled in constant chaos and conflict and dysfunction, our colleagues across the aisle are charting down a dangerous path – and I can think of no greater example of their disconnect than the Republican Study Committee’s backwards budget.  “Their plan upends critical programs, makes draconian cuts to Medicare and Social Security. It raises health care costs. It would strip coverage for millions, forcing Americans to work longer for less, and makes caring for our families more costly. The American people disagree with this plan. Overwhelmingly. A Navigator poll that was released today showing just how displeased they are with the Republicans attempts to slash these critical programs. “We are lucky to have in the House Democratic Caucus, a constellation of leaders who are on the front lines fighting against the Republican efforts to harm working families, including, of course, the Ranking Member on the Subcommittee for Social Security on Ways and Means and someone who's been a champion for Social Security throughout the duration of his career in the United States Congress, including, formerly as the chairman of our House Democratic Caucus, John Larson from Connecticut.” Social Security Ranking Member, Rep. Larson: “At a time when Congress has been looking at wealth disparity, it has to look no further than its own inaction. More than 50 years have passed since the United States Congress has enhanced Social Security. Every person here understands the necessity of what has to be done for the American people. 10,000 baby boomers a day become eligible for Social Security, and more than 40% of the 70 million Americans on Social Security – it's the only retirement benefit that they have. Democrats have a plan. We're going to make sure that there's an across-the-board increase. We're going to make sure that no one can retire into poverty.”  Ranking Member of the House Budget Committee, Rep. Boyle: “Every single Republican except for one on the House Budget Committee is a member of the Republican Study Committee. So, this is clearly the Republican budget. And what does it do? Right there, in black and white, it cuts Social Security for every American who is currently 59 years of age or younger by raising the retirement age. The retirement age is already going up. The full retirement age today is 66 and a half. It will soon be 67. How high do they want to go? 70? 72?”  “I would like to help my Republican friends get a little more attention for their crazy ideas. Because they're dangerous. These devastating cuts to Social Security and Medicare would impact almost every American family. Certainly, the families that I represent in North and Northeast Philadelphia and many places beyond. The good news is that House Democrats are here to fight them every step of the way. But let's be clear: If they're putting out their plan, we should believe them. This is what they plan to do if we don't fight back and stop them.”  Chair Jayapal: “What did Democrats do? Democrats? When we had the gavels, we worked hard to lower costs, health care costs for Americans across this country. We are the ones that made it possible to have a $35 a month insulin cap and a $2,000 a year out-of-pocket cap for seniors. Republicans are proposing stripping that progress.”  “All of this is also so that Republicans can keep giving big pharma and the wealthiest billionaires tax cuts. It's cruel, extreme, and unworkable. And Democrats are going to fight tooth and nail all the way, not only to prevent their extreme plan from being in place, but actually to implement our own plan, which continues to lower health care costs for seniors and for all Americans.” Chair Kuster: “This far right Republican House has made bipartisanship harder than ever before. And this misguided budget proposal is the latest example of the stark contrast between our values and the values that are represented by MAGA Republicans. From cuts to Medicare to raising the retirement age for Americans across the country and slashing Social Security benefits. This proposal would represent a massive step backward for the American people who are looking to Congress to move our country forward.” Co-Chair of the Task Force on Aging, Rep. Schakowsky: “What we are seeing is an attack on the most basic programs that define the United States of America, for example Social Security or Medicare. The Republican Study group, which makes up the majority of the Republican Party right now in the House of Representatives, has put in writing what they want to do, including raising the age of Social Security.”  “But when they talk about cutting Social Security, they are talking about taking money out of people’s pockets that they earned. Let's remember Social Security. Every single paycheck, people pay into it and expect to get it out. So, when they say that they want to raise the age, which is definitely a cut, they are saying they want to go into your pocket and taking money that is yours away [...] Democrats stand for the American people. We stand for making sure that all of these benefits are intact, and defeating the MAGA Republicans, who want nothing more than to make life miserable for most Americans.”  Key excerpts from the Q&A, include:  On GOP’s Motion to Vacate threats… Assistant Leader Neguse: “First and foremost, the chaos and the dysfunction that House Republicans have engulfed the U.S. Congress into for the better part of the last 15 months does nothing to help the American people and solve the consequential challenges that we face as a country. At the end of the day, any decision with respect to a Motion to Vacate or anything along those lines would be a decision that's made by our Leader, by Leader Jeffries, who has, I think, artfully and masterfully, time after time navigated, a number of these situations over the course of the last 15, 16 months.”  On MAGA Republicans endangering national security… Assistant Leader Neguse: “You're certainly right that the clock is ticking. It has been ticking. And Republican obstinance and delays have unfortunately, in my view, undermined our national security and the ability of our allies across the globe. House Republicans have faced a binary choice for the better part of the last two and a half months. And it is a choice that not just House Democrats have articulate it to them, but Senate Democrats, Mitch McConnell, the Republican Leader of the United States Senate, which is support our allies, support our national security by bringing forward, the bipartisan Senate bill, which passed, as you know, with 70 votes in the United States Senate on a bipartisan basis.”  Recording of the full press conference and Q&A can be found HERE.  ###

April 17,Lori Trahan,D,Mass.-3,Trahan Secures Nation’s Top Health Official’s Commitment to Support Massachusetts Steward Crisis Response,"Washington, D.C. — Today, New Democrat Coalition leaders, including NDC Chair Annie Kuster (NH-02) and New Dem Reps. Nikki Budzinksi (IL-13), Angie Craig (MN-02), Shontel Brown (OH-11), Gabe Vasquez (NM-02), and Emilia Sykes (OH-13) led a press conference calling on House Republican Leadership to join Democrats in funding the Affordable Connectivity Program, which will expire on April 30th without additional Congressional action. Ahead of the press conference, 95 New Dem Members – led by Reps. Craig and Budzinski – sent a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson calling on him to deliver for the American people and bring legislation to the floor that provides the ACP with the funding it needs without delay. You can read the full transcript of the press conference below and read the letter to Speaker Johnson here: Chair Annie Kuster:  Good afternoon everyone. I’m Annie Kuster, Chair of the New Democrat Coalition and I’m proud to stand here with my fellow New Dems in calling on Speaker Johnson and House Republicans to join us in saving the Affordable Connectivity Program.  Our Members were instrumental in securing this legislation as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in 2022. But now, if Congress doesn’t act, American households across the country could lose the ACP benefit and potentially lose internet access altogether. The ACP currently empowers 23 million American households across the country to access affordable broadband.  In my home state of New Hampshire alone, it has benefitted nearly 40 thousand households. These New Hampshire households are using this access to grow their small business operations online, access medical care through telehealth services, while some rural communities are getting this level of access for the first time.   Unfortunately, despite this being a bipartisan effort just two years ago, House Republican Leadership has blocked any consideration of funding for this program, pushing the ACP towards extinction. It’s no coincidence that Republicans don’t want to renew one of the most popular programs passed under a Democratic President during an election year.  But this isn’t a red-state or blue-state issue, this program benefits all Americans by ensuring everyone can participate in our modern, digital economy, regardless of where they live. A lapse in funding, which is expected at the end of April, will lead to a direct increase in broadband costs for consumers, internet disruptions, and lapses in coverage.  We all know how important the internet is to every generation. It enables children to complete their schoolwork, parents and adults to do their jobs, and grandparents and seniors to stay in touch with their family and friends. From ordering groceries to telehealth appointments and more, the internet is critical to participating fully in a 21st-century America.  That’s why our Coalition is here today, calling on Republicans to put aside their partisan politics and work with Democrats to secure this lifeline for American households once and for all. Now, I’m thrilled to turn it over to New Dem Angie Craig, who led the letter from New Dems with Nikki Budzinski.  Rep. Angie Craig: Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for being here today. We are here to urge Republican leaders to extend funding for the Affordable Connectivity Program – funding that is set to partially run out this month if nothing is done. The fact that we – here on Capitol Hill – are debating whether or not this program should exist is just another one of the unbelievable things here on Capitol Hill. Our entire world revolves around receiving and disseminating information, emails and messages quickly. No one at this press conference – or in this building – none of them could do their job without internet access. So how can we stand here – living in a world with unfettered access to the internet and all the benefits that come with it – and expect our rural communities to navigate the 21st century without internet access, when we never could? Today, I ask every Member to recognize the importance that high-speed internet access offers you, your family, your staff – and just try and picture your life without it, even for just one day. If you can’t live without internet, how could we ever ask rural Americans to? Cutting funding for the Affordable Connectivity Program will have devastating consequences. It would mean again that children are forced to sit in McDonalds’ parking lots just to do their homework, farmers unable to access online marketplaces for their products and rural Minnesotans left without access to telehealth resources. We cannot accept that reality for rural America – and I’m joining my New Dem colleagues and urging Republican leadership to step up to the plate and extend the funding for this critical program. Thank you so much, and now I’d like to turn it over to Representative Shontel Brown. Rep. Shontel Brown: Hello everyone, I’m Congresswoman Shontel Brown, representing Cleveland and Northeast Ohio. I’m proud to join my colleagues in urging Speaker Johnson to bring Congresswoman Clarke’s legislation to extend the ACP to the floor. Let’s be very clear. Killing the ACP is irresponsible… illogical… and inequitable. Killing the ACP is a conscious decision to deepen the digital divide. New Dems and members across our Caucus have been sounding the alarm on this for months – and Republican leadership is not budging. It saddens me that this is not a bigger story – because it shows how invisible lower-income people can be. In my district 46%... 46% of households have enrolled in the ACP. Nearly half. That’s one of the highest figures in the country. We’re talking about 135,000 households in my district. That should tell you about the level of need we have. And a very large percentage of these households are Black and Brown. And this mirrors what has taken place nationally… where over 5 million Black households have enrolled in the ACP. And these are people who literally just signed up. And now we’re pulling the plug and cutting the cord. The ACP is the difference between having high-speed internet or not, for lots of those households. That means access to telehealth, digital learning, job opportunities, entrepreneurship… and so much more. So often the other side of the aisle talks about self-empowerment and self-improvement. Well, this is one of the most necessary components to empowerment – and we need to extend it, not end it.  Finally, the digital divide is not new. It’s not something we just started talking about in 2020. The Department of Commerce identified racial and other disparities in internet access as a problem in 1995. And now here we are 30 years later …with the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the ACP… we made the most significant investment to date in closing the digital divide ever. We should not just throw away this progress. We cannot pull the plug on our constituents. It’s time for the Speaker to do the right thing and extend the ACP. And with that it is my privilege to turn it over the gentlewoman from Illinois, Nikki Budzinski. Rep. Nikki Budzinski: Good afternoon. My name is Nikki Budzinski. I represent the 13th District of Illinois – communities in Central and Southern Illinois. When I flipped this seat last year from red to blue, in 2022, voters tasked me with coming to Washington to bring down costs – the costs of everyday services to help working families at home. And that’s what the Affordable Connectivity Program is all about.  The ACP ensures that lower-income households can afford access to high-speed internet for work, school, health care and a lot more. In 2024, access to internet isn’t a luxury, it’s a necessity. Since the ACP was launched, more than 17 million households across the country have received support from this program. In the district I serve, I have more than 75,000 households that have subscribed to the Affordable Connectivity Program. And it’s saving families in my district nearly $40 million a year.  I held a roundtable in East St. Louis where nearly every household – exactly 95 percent of the residents in East St. Louis are reliant on the Affordable Connectivity Program in order to get internet access. In this one community in my district, I heard about what this program has meant for students, for families, for workers, for patients in East St. Louis during this roundtable. And this is quite frankly all at risk if the ACP expires at the end of this month.  My office has heard from more than 9,000 constituents who would be hurt by the disruption of this program. If Congress allows the ACP to lapse, internet services for millions of Americans will be disrupted. And that’s why I’m so proud to stand with the New Democrats and the colleagues behind me to urge the GOP leadership to maintain this critical program for families in my district and working families all across this country where it truly makes a very big difference. Thank you so much.”  Rep. Gabe Vasquez: Good afternoon, buenos tardes, my name is Gabe Vasquez. I proudly represent the second district of New Mexico, and I stand with my colleagues here today to advocate for common sense programs that help keep our low income and rural communities connected.  I understand how critical it is for my district in New Mexico to have affordable Internet access. Similar to my colleagues who represent these rural and low income districts, 40% of households in my district lack access to high speed internet. 180,000 families benefit from this program across the state. But these are more than just numbers. They're more than just statistics. This program represents the potential and the future of our families in New Mexico, whose lives are profoundly impacted by the continuation of this program. I've heard from constituents in the most rural parts of my district – in fact, they are conservative communities – where their livelihood depends on maintaining something like a website for their hunting and guiding businesses. I've listened to seniors in places like Deming and Truth or Consequences, who rely on internet services to stay connected with their families and have access to essential services, like tele-health and medication management. And I received messages for mothers, moms in my district.  We've shared how the ACP has allowed them to better manage their budget so that they can buy an extra $50 worth of groceries that month. This program makes a real tangible difference in the lives of everyday Americans from New Mexico to Ohio. But come April 30, without congressional action, we will be responsible for taking away one of the most vital resources that low income families across our nation have to access health care, education, information, and their own ability and independence to shape their own future.  We cannot in good conscience allow that to happen. That's why we must extend the Affordable Connectivity Program. Let our children be educated. Let their parents work. Let our seniors and our veterans access the health care that they deserve. Let small businesses thrive in rural America. That's what we're asking collectively here today. Let's keep America united and connected. Thank you. I'll now yield to my colleague from the great state of Ohio, Emilia Sykes. Rep. Emilia Sykes: Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you Congressman Vasquez, and thank you, Congresswoman Kuster and Congresswoman Budzinski for organizing today's press conference. My name is Amelia Sykes and I proudly represent Ohio's 13th congressional district in Northeast Ohio.  I'm glad to join my New Dem colleagues today to help call on House Republican leadership to take immediate action to extend the Affordable Connectivity Program, which 84,755 households in my district rely on for affordable internet services. In today's age, access to the internet is not a luxury – it is a necessity. In Northeast Ohio, and in my district, urban, rural and suburban communities alike rely on internet access to learn, work, seek medical care, and explore new opportunities.  The Affordable Connectivity Program has helped to close the digital divide in Ohio, and it provides critical resources to people in my district that depend on this for their livelihoods. In fact, this is the number one issue of concern for my constituents. I'll say that again. This is the number one issue of concern for constituents in my district.  My office has received thousands of emails from concerned constituents throughout my district from across the political spectrum, all worried about how they will afford connectivity if ACP runs out. Without this program, the cost of broadband for people in Ohio's 13th district and across the country will simply increase. My constituents and other Americans across the country cannot afford higher costs because of Republican inaction.  I promised the people in Ohio’s 13th district that I would fight to lower costs. And that's exactly what I intend to do by fighting to keep the Affordable Connectivity Program going. I hope my House Republican colleagues can put politics aside, join us in working for the people of our districts, and extend this vital program. ###"
April 17,Lori Trahan,D,Mass.-3,Trahan Pushes for Stronger Data Privacy and Transparency Provisions in Bipartisan Privacy Package,"Washington, D.C. — Today, New Democrat Coalition Leadership released the following statement in support of the national security supplemental funding bills introduced in the House that reflect the Senate-passed, bipartisan National Security Act, 2024: “For the last six months, New Dems have repeatedly urged House Republican leadership to bring forward legislation that supports our imperiled allies, Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan, and delivers much-needed humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza and around the world.  “Now, following months of House Republicans playing political football and ultimately blocking the Senate-passed national security package, the House will finally have the opportunity to vote on legislation that provides crucial aid to our allies in their battles against tyranny and terror.  “New Dem leadership supports this essential national security funding and urges our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join us in voting for its passage. “Now more than ever, for the sake of global democracy and freedom as well as our own national security, Congress must act swiftly and decisively to support our allies and protect innocent lives.  “America is always at its strongest when we stand with our friends – not when we turn our backs on them. We look forward to delivering this critical funding to President Biden’s desk without delay.” Read more about the Coalition’s repeated calls for a comprehensive security supplemental below: On April 14th, following Iran’s attack on Israel, New Dem leaders called on Speaker Johnson to once and for all bring a national security funding package to the floor by the end of the week. On March 22nd, after negotiators released the second six-bill appropriations package, New Dem leaders urged House Republican Leadership to live up to their commitments and bring a security and humanitarian aid package to the floor. On February 13th, following the Senate’s bipartisan passage of the National Security Act, 2024, New Dem leaders urged Speaker Johnson to “once and for all put the American people over petty politics and swiftly bring this bill to the full House for a vote.” On February 5th, New Dem Leadership and immigration and national security leaders released a statement in strong support of the Senate-negotiated border and national security package and admonished House Republicans for rejecting it out of hand. On December 19th, after Speaker Johnson dismissed lawmakers for the year without addressing critical priorities, New Dem Chair Kuster vowed that the Coalition would continue fighting to secure a deal that would send much-needed aid to U.S. allies. On November 15th, National Security Task Force Chair Marilyn Strickland (WA-10) led 44 New Dems in a letter to Armed Services Committee leadership promoting the Coalition’s priorities for the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Increased security cooperation with key allies like Ukraine and Israel was an integral part of these priorities. On November 15th, New Dem leaders penned a letter to congressional leadership with a total of 76 New Dem Members urging them to schedule a vote on President Biden’s supplemental request for security and humanitarian aid in support of Israel, Ukraine, Taiwan, and humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza. New Dem Leadership previously endorsed the $106 billion supplemental on October 20th. On November 2nd, NDC Leadership released a statement strongly opposing Speaker Johnson’s hyper-partisan supplemental appropriations bill that isolated Israel’s aid from support for Ukraine and Taiwan and omitted humanitarian aid for civilians in Gaza. They urged the Speaker to bring the President’s supplemental to the floor. ### "

WASHINGTON – Today, Congressman David G. Valadao (CA-22) joined Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger (VA-07) and Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA) to introduce the Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act. The bipartisan, bicameral legislation aims to provide foundational digital skills to workers through a new “Digital Skills at Work” grant program.  “Ensuring people have the digital skills they need to navigate the modern job market is critical to the strength of our economy,” said Congressman Valadao. “When people enter the workforce with the foundational skills they need, it not only eases the burden on employers, but it sets people on a path to success for the rest of their careers. I’m proud to join Rep. Spanberger in introducing this bipartisan legislation that will help better prepare our workforce and strengthen our economy.” “When we help job seekers learn and refine on-the-job skills, we are helping Americans advance their careers and helping businesses hold on to adept and experienced employees. This bipartisan, bicameral legislation would empower states, localities, and local organizations — that are already doing incredible work to support our local workforces — to assist Virginians and Americans across the country in learning and building the industry-specific digital skills that will help them succeed in our 21st century economy,” said Congresswoman Spanberger. “Investments to close the digital skills gap help our workforce and our communities stay competitive and stay ahead, and I’m grateful for the support of Senator Kaine and Congressman Valadao as we work to deliver this support.” “Digital skills can be a gateway to new job opportunities for so many Virginians, especially at a time when I’m hearing from employers across the Commonwealth about how hard they’re working to hire up,” said Senator Kaine. “The Digital Skills for Today’s Workforce Act would make it easier for people to access high-quality digital training programs to develop or hone those skills. Investing in our workforce is good for our workers, employers, and overall economy, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join us in supporting this bill.” Background  According to the National Skills Coalition and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, 92 percent of today’s jobs require digital skills. Nearly one-third of workers do not have the foundational digital skills — such as email, spreadsheets, or data entry — to enter and succeed in today’s workforce.

WASHINGTON – Following Iran’s unprecedented attack on Israel over the weekend, the House of Representatives passed several pieces of legislation to hold Iran and its terrorist proxies accountable. Congressman David G. Valadao (CA-22) released the following statement: “The Biden administration’s strategy of appeasement toward Iran has failed,” said Congressman Valadao. “President Biden freed up $6 billion in Iranian assets last year, which only served to embolden the Iranian regime and their terrorist proxies who wish to do us harm. I voted in support of several bills this week to sanction Iran, designate their proxies as foreign terrorist organizations, and give Congress greater oversight of any administration that tries to weaken sanctions on Iran. We must send a clear message that there will be consequences for attacking American allies.” The Biden administration has taken several actions that have emboldened Iran, including waiving sanctions to allow $6 billion in Iranian funds to be transferred back to Qatar September of 2023.

April 16,Ann McLane Kuster,D,N.H.-2,Kuster Urges Action to Secure Patient Data Following Change Healthcare Cyberattack,"Washington, D.C. – Yesterday, House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington (R-TX) offered an amendment at the House Rules Committee hearing on H.R. 8034, 8035, 8036, and 8038 to the 21stCentury Peace Through Strength Act. His amendment would have fully offset the cost of these bills, contributed at least $50 billion to deficit reduction, and helped restore fiscal responsibility. Ultimately, the amendment was not advanced by the Rules Committee for consideration on the House Floor due to House Rules. Chairman Arrington released the following statement after introducing his amendment: “At a time when our national debt is approaching $35 trillion, we are adding almost $8 billion to the debt every day, and we pay 62 cents on every dollar just to service the debt, we must lead Congress toward a path of fiscal responsibility. This trajectory is unsustainable and is arguably the biggest threat facing our nation. “That’s why I introduced an amendment to the foreign aid package that would offset the costs of the bills being considered this week. It would do so by equalizing Medicare payments for services that can be safely delivered in a physician’s office, reducing spending and lowering health care costs for millions of seniors. “The amendment is common sense. The policy is bipartisan. Implementing this policy would not only pay for these security bills but would contribute at least $50 billion to deficit reduction. It’s a win for patients. It’s a win for deficit reduction. It’s a win for the American people.

“Not paying for our spending is not only irresponsible, it’s irrational. We cannot continue to thrust the costs of things we think are important onto the backs of our kids and grandkids.""
 Watch Chairman Arrington’s remarks at the House Rules Committee here. Background: In a significant step toward fiscal responsibility and lowering health care costs, Chairman Arrington’s amendment would have fully offset the cost of the national security supplemental, with an additional contribution of at least $50 billion towards federal deficit reduction.

The proposed amendment would have had the added benefit of reducing out-of-pocket health care costs for millions of seniors. Under the current system, Medicare's higher payments for services delivered in hospital outpatient departments lead to higher out-of-pocket expenses for seniors. Furthermore, this difference in payment for the same services has created a financial incentive for hospital systems to acquire freestanding physician offices, fueling consolidation that reduces competition, drives up costs for patients, and limits choices for patients.

This policy reform aligns with prior recommendations from the nonpartisan Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) and was included in the budgets of both President Obama and President Trump.

This policy was also included in the Committee-advanced House Republican Fiscal Year 2025 “Reverse the Curse” Budget Resolution to generate savings in order to balance the Federal budget in 10 years.

Additionally, this amendment is similar to a policy included in the House Republican Lower Costs, More Transparency (H.R. 5378/Sec. 203)  that passed the House last December that equalized Medicare payments for physician-administered medicines.

While the amendment was not advanced for consideration on the House Floor by the Rules Committee, the House Budget Committee continues to Sound the Alarm about the dire fiscal path our nation is on.

April 17,Ann McLane Kuster,D,N.H.-2,"Kuster, House Assistant Minority Leader Neguse: ""Seniors Over Special Interests, Families Over Corporations, People Over Politics""","Today, Congresswoman Veronica Escobar (TX-16) and Congressman Joaquin Castro (TX-20) led 24 of their colleagues in sending a letter to U.S Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, and Director of National Intelligence Avril Hanes expressing concerns over the methodology used in National Security Memorandum (NSM) 20 to ensure Israel is following national security guidelines and not disrupting the delivery of humanitarian aid.  The National Security Memorandum (NSM) 20 is the recently released White House policy memorandum that requires recipients of U.S. assistance to provide written assurances that they will use assistance in compliance with international law and facilitate and not restrict the delivery of humanitarian aid, and it establishes new reporting requirements to Congress on these provisions.  The lawmakers wrote: “We write to express our deep concern regarding the U.S. Department of State’s recent comments regarding assurances from the Israeli government, under National Security Memorandum (NSM) 20, that the Israeli government is using U.S-origin weapons in full compliance with relevant U.S. and international law and is not restricting the delivery of humanitarian assistance. In the face of mounting credible and deeply troubling reports and allegations that Israel has used U.S arms in ways that violate U.S. and international law, including international humanitarian law as it relates to civilian protections and aid flow, we believe a failure to question, at minimum, the Netanyahu government’s assurances, violates the very spirit of the NSM-20 process.  “For months, elected representatives, intergovernmental bodies, international courts, Israeli and global human rights observers – along with government officials themselves – have persistently expressed grave concerns regarding the actions of the Netanyahu government,” the lawmakers continued. “These include its conduct throughout the war in Gaza, its policies regarding civilian harm and military targeting, unauthorized expansion of settlements and settler violence in the West Bank and potential use of U.S. arms by settlers in additional to limitations on humanitarian aid supported by the US. We are concerned that some of Israel's actions may not be consistent with international humanitarian law, which the United States has an interest in consistently upholding.  “We remain concerned by the stark differences and gaps in the statements being made by the State Department and White House on how Israel has not been found to be in violation of international humanitarian law, either when it comes to the conduct of the war or when it comes to the provision of humanitarian assistance, which are contradictory to those made by prominent experts and global institutions. Given the dire and catastrophic nature of this war, it is critical to ensure that the U.S. government is fully utilizing the expertise of State Department and DoD officials and legal experts, accounting important intelligence community assessments and data, in thoroughly assessing Israel’s actions in Gaza. Non- political experts’ substantive analysis is vital to ensuring the accuracy and credibility of any and all of the assessments under NSM-20, as well as in the arms transfer review process and security assistance obligation process.”  The Members sent this letter ahead of the NSM-20 report that is due to Congress on May 8th and was signed by Representatives Earl Blumenauer, Jamaal Bowman, Cori Bush, André Carson, Greg Casar, Sean Casten, Madeleine Dean, Mark DeSaulnier, Lloyd Doggett, Maxwell Alejandro Frost, Jesús “Chuy” García, Pramila Jayapal, Henry C. “Hank” Johnson, Jr., Stephen Lynch, James McGovern, Eleanor Holmes Norton, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Mark Pocan, Ayanna Pressley, Delia Ramirez, Rashida Tlaib, Jill Tokuda, and Bonnie Watson Coleman.

April 17,Ann McLane Kuster,D,N.H.-2,New Dem Leaders Hold Press Conference Urging House Republicans to Join Democrats in Saving the Affordable Connectivity Program,"This week, Congresswoman Veronica Escobar (TX-16) joined 94 of her New Democrat Coalition colleagues in a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson calling on House Republican Leadership to take immediate bipartisan action to fund the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP).  Enacted as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law championed by Congresswoman Escobar and House Democrats last Congress, the Affordable Connectivity Program currently empowers 23 million households across the country, including over 81,000 in El Paso, access to affordable broadband. Without additional funding from Congress, the ACP will cease entirely on April 30th, and millions of households could lose crucial internet access.   “House Democrats and President Biden established this program as part of our broader commitment to lower costs for Americans,” said Congresswoman Escobar. “Allowing the ACP funding to lapse would directly lead to increased broadband costs or direct cessation of internet services for millions of Americans and thousands of El Pasoans. In a modern world where broadband is increasingly becoming a necessity for school, work, and everyday life, I join my colleagues in urging Speaking Johnson to immediately provide additional funding to the ACP.”  In a survey sent out by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to ACP enrollees, more than three-quarters (77%) of the respondents say losing their ACP benefit would disrupt their internet service by making them change their plan or drop internet service entirely. Additionally, in an email survey sent out by the Office of Congresswoman Escobar, 92% of respondents agreed that Speaker Johnson should bring H.R. 6929, the Affordable Connectivity Program Extension Act of 2024 to the House floor for a vote.  Congresswoman Escobar is a proud co-sponsor of H.R. 6929, the Affordable Connectivity Program Extension Act of 2024. This bill would provide $7 billion in federal funds for the ACP. She has also signed onto Discharge Petition #11 that would prioritize a vote on H.R. 6929.  You can read the full letter from Congresswoman Escobar and her New Democratic Coalition colleagues here.

Beyer for his leadership to ensure that coal companies clean up their messes and that land and water in coal communities is restored properly.” The Stream Protection and Vegetation Restoration Act would require timely reclamation by setting enforceable deadlines for reclamation milestones, and improve inspections and monitoring protocols for surface water and ground water during mining and reclamation.

April 17,David Valadao,R,Calif.-22,"Valadao, Spanberger, Kaine Introduce Bill to Strengthen U.S. Workforce",
April 18,David Valadao,R,Calif.-22,Congressman Valadao Stands Against Iranian Aggression,"Today, Representative Debbie Dingell (MI-06), co-chair of the Assisting Caregivers Today (ACT) Caucus, along with Senators Bob Casey (D-PA), Chairman of the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging, Tim Kaine (D-VA), and Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), introduced legislation to tackle the caregiving crisis by reprioritizing long-term caregivers and supporting their work based on the value they bring to families. Millions of families with aging loved ones and people with disabilities require skilled care to live, but many caregivers today work long hours for low pay, resulting in some workers being forced the leave their field for higher paying jobs. This instability has resulted in widespread worker shortages for those in need of essential care.
 
The Long-Term Care Workforce Support Act would ensure that caregiving can be a sustainable, lifelong career by providing substantial new funding to support workers in every part of the long-term care industry, from nursing homes to home-care to assisted living facilities. By improving caregiver compensation, benefits, and support systems, the bill would ensure the nation has a strong, qualified pipeline of workers to provide much-needed care for older adults and people with disabilities.
 
“Caregiving is the foundation of our economy. It allows for all other work to be possible. No care worker should have to live below the poverty line to do this work that millions of Americans depend on. As many know, this is deeply personal for me – I was lucky to have my husband John receive care at home, but many others do not have the same opportunity,” said Congresswoman Dingell. “This legislation will make much needed investments in our care infrastructure and workforce, including family caregivers, to ensure they have the support they need, are paid a living wage, and are able to continue doing their critical jobs.”
 
“We have a crisis of caregiving in this country, and it’s a crisis that stems largely from a lack of support for and investment in our caregiving workforce,” said Senator Casey. “We cannot claim to be the greatest country in the world if we do not have the greatest caregiving in the world. We need to invest in these workers not just to ensure that caregiving can be a sustainable, lifelong career, but to improve the quality and availability of care for all who need it.”
 
“Every American, regardless of where they live, deserves access to quality, affordable care throughout their lives,” said Senator Kaine. “But too often, direct care workers in long-term care settings are overworked and underpaid, resulting in significant workforce shortages – especially in our rural communities. I’m proud to co-lead this legislation to help address the root causes of shortages in our care system, including by improving compensation and by providing pathways to enter the field. This will lead to healthier communities, and improved quality of life for older adults, people with disabilities, and their caregivers.”
 
“Having served as my grandmother’s primary caregiver as she aged, I know the hard work that goes into caregiving and the world of difference high-quality care makes for our loved ones,” said Senator Baldwin. “Right now, we're facing a desperate shortage in our long-term care workforce and sadly, it’s no surprise: many caregivers are forced to be on the clock for long hours, get low pay, and work in tough conditions. We owe it to caregivers who devote their lives to helping others to invest in the caregiving workforce, giving these compassionate workers the respect they deserve, attracting fresh talent, and ensuring our loved ones get high-quality care.”
 
Caregiving is in crisis across the United States. Caregivers are widely underpaid, earning a median wage of $15.43 an hour and often living in poverty. The result is caregivers are in short supply—a recent survey revealed 92% of nursing home respondents and nearly 70% of assisted living facilities reported significant or severe workforce shortages. Another recent survey of home and community-based services (HCBS) providers showed all 50 states experiencing home care worker shortages, and 43 states reported that some HCBS providers have closed due to worker shortages.
 
The Long Term Care Workforce Support Act will address this crisis by stabilizing, growing, and supporting the direct care professional workforce. Specifically, the Long-Term Care Workforce Support Act will:"

April 17,Jodey Arrington,R,Tex.-19,Arrington Issues Statement on the Fourth Amendment Is Not For Sale Act,"Today, House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Jerrold Nadler and Representative Joaquin Castro (D-TX) sent a letter to the Chief Executive Officers of the Walt Disney Company, Warner Bros. Discovery, and FOX, seeking more information about the companies’ new joint sports streaming venture (“JV”). The unnamed JV, which was announced in February and is expected to debut this fall, unites the three most dominant programmers in the sports streaming space, which collectively own the rights to 80 percent of all sports streaming content.  The members explain, “As programmers, your companies exert tremendous influence over pricing across the live sports TV ecosystem. Upstream, programmers negotiate content licensing deals with sports leagues like the National Football League and the National Basketball Association for the media rights to their sports events. Downstream, programmers determine the terms on which video distributors may license programmers’ sports channels.”   “Without more complete information about the pricing, intent, and organization of this new venture, we are concerned that this consolidation will result in higher prices for consumers and less fair licensing terms for upstream sports leagues and downstream video distributors.”   To determine whether the JV will reduce competition and harm consumers, the members ask the companies to submit responses to a series of questions about the JV’s intent, pricing, licensing, and organizational structure.  The companies have until April 30 to respond via email and are instructed to copy the Department of Justice in their reply.  "
April 17,Jodey Arrington,R,Tex.-19,"Arrington Responds to Senate Democrats Dismissing Mayorkas Impeachment Without Full, Complete Trial","Today, Ranking Member Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) delivered the following opening statement, as prepared, for the House Judiciary Constitution and Limited Government Subcommittee Hearing on “Liberty, Tyranny, and Accountability: COVID-19 and the Constitution”: ""Mr. Chairman, our former colleague, and current Ambassador to Japan, Rahm Emmanuel, is often quoted as saying “You never want a serious crisis to go to waste.”  I believe that my Republican colleagues think that this idea applies to the topic of today’s hearing. The COVID-19 pandemic was a serious public health crisis, and four years later House Republicans are still attempting to capitalize on that global trauma for political gain.  Today’s hearing is nothing more than a platform for extreme MAGA Republicans to spread skepticism of public health officials to advance the conservative persecution complex that has become the cornerstone of their political identity.  Any reasonable reading of the facts from that time makes it clear that this portrayal is a bogus, politically motivated hit job.  Public health officials at the local, state, and federal levels are dedicated public servants, who at the time had to act on the limited information available, in response to a nationwide public health crisis.  The facts demonstrate that they took reasoned, good faith actions in response to an infectious disease that, even to this day, quite literally continues to evolve.  I would note, however, that the House Judiciary Committee has no expertise on matters of public health policy or medical science.  If the Republicans wanted a discussion about lessons learned from the Nation’s experience with COVID-19, I would welcome it.  As to whether officials had the authority to take the steps that they did, that authority was, and largely remains, broad, even after years of legal challenges stemming from the pandemic.

That is to say that, while individual constitutional rights are always in force, even during a public health emergency, the Constitution is not a suicide pact. No legal right is absolute, and the Constitution itself accounts for the need for government to respond to protect the nation from serious threats. Given the chaotic and uncertain circumstances in which they were operating, not every decision by a public health official may have struck the ideal balance between the need to protect public health and respect for individual rights.  That is why we have a court system.  Nonetheless, overall, those public officials’ decisions were made in good faith and saved countless lives during a public health emergency involving a novel and rapidly spreading infectious disease that was killing more than 1,000 people a day in the early part of the pandemic, and which, so far, has killed more than a million Americans.  Individuals may have varying tolerances for personal risk, but individual choices about vaccination, quarantining, masking, or other public health measures can also seriously affect other people’s health. In particular, the most vulnerable members of our society are at risk during an event involving an infectious disease. This includes the very young, the very old, those with preexisting conditions, and the working poor, who historically lack access to health care and are disproportionately represented among ethnic and racial minorities. According to the apparent viewpoint of extreme MAGA Republicans, the government should have done nothing during the pandemic to protect the public, while vulnerable Americans are left to fend for themselves.  That is not my idea of “freedom”. This apparent callousness demonstrates that, for some of our colleagues, public health policy is just another angle from which to cast government officials as power hungry bureaucrats to suit their narrow political interests, no matter what the facts may be. But while the MAGA Republicans may think that a revisionist hearing like this—relitigating the government response to the COVID-19 pandemic to recast it as a tyrannical power grab-is a political winner, there is, in fact, no winner.  Instead, the American people will lose.   Politicizing public health policy has real consequences for the American people, even outside of a once-in-a-century pandemic.  One must look no further than the impact that vaccine skepticism has had on the spread of infectious diseases that we once thought contained but are now spreading again. I would just write today’s hearing off as yet another MAGA extremist rant were it not for the corrosive impact on Americans’ trust in public health officials.  The American public deserves better than this hearing. "
April 18,Jodey Arrington,R,Tex.-19,Arrington Fights to Strengthen Iranian Sanctions,"Today, Ranking Member Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) delivered the following statement on the House Floor, as prepared, in support of H.R. 4639, the ""Fourth Amendment is Not for Sale Act"": ""Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4639, the “Fourth Amendment Is Not for Sale Act.”  I was proud to join Congressman Davidson in introducing this strong bipartisan legislation to help prevent government overreach by prohibiting the warrantless purchase of customer data.  When the Judiciary Committee considered this bill at markup last July, it received a rare unanimous 30-to-zero vote. When we download applications to our phones, we do so because we think they will make our lives just a little better.  Weather apps tell us if we should bring an umbrella to work, delivery apps allow us to order groceries to our homes, and even employee work apps let us know the schedule for the week.  Some of these convenience applications, however, can come with a dark side that they generally do not disclose to the American public: That the data they collect from us is immediately sold to the highest bidder.  Third party purchasers of this data, often referred to as “data brokers” collect and package the data to sell to advertisers, market researchers, and governmental entities, to name only a few.  While many argue that the data they purchase from applications, websites, and social media is “de-identified” when it is sold, experts agree that just four points of data are needed to “reidentify” this data.  Because of this, the purchaser of a data set can piece together significant information about us.  For example, they can track an individual’s commuting habits, including which businesses they drive by on their way to work, when they are not at home, and even when they visit places that are not part of their normal commute. That anyone should have Americans’ private information is highly troubling to me.  But that our federal government can obtain it without a warrant should be troubling to all of us.  The Supreme Court in U.S. v. Jones unanimously found that the government’s use of a GPS tracker on the subject’s car is considered a “search” under the Fourth Amendment.  But in 2004, when the search in Jones occurred, not everyone had a phone in their pocket—the ecosystem of data brokers had not yet come to life.  If the government wants to track a suspect today, they could go through the trouble of establishing probable cause and getting a warrant.  Or federal law enforcement could simply purchase data from a third party about the target of their operation.  If that purchased data included location data for their subject, they would have no need for checks and balances, no need for a warrant, and during an ensuing criminal trial, no obligation even to tell the court how they obtained the initial data in the first place. We have the Fourth Amendment for a reason.  If law enforcement wants to gather information about you, they should first obtain a warrant.  They should have to go to a judge and explain why there is probable cause and why they need to know this information.  When federal law enforcement agencies purchase this data, however, they bypass our judicial system entirely. Our current state of affairs is clearly not what our Founders intended.  Our right to privacy is being abrogated every day by those whose job it is to keep us safe.  The Fourth Amendment Is Not for Sale Act would change that.  Under the bill before us today, the federal government would be prohibited from exchanging anything of value for data from third party vendors.  The law already prohibits applications and websites—electronic communications services and remote computing services—from sharing information with the government without a warrant.  The Fourth Amendment Is Not For Sale Act would extend that same rule to the data brokers to which they sell.  This legislation would also ensure that the government does not circumvent these rules by prohibiting both “indirect” acquisition of information and agency sharing of third-party data.  This way, federal law enforcement could neither acquire prohibited data from individuals who purchase the data and then pass it on to the government, nor could they receive the desired data from non-law enforcement federal agencies. I thank Congressman Davidson and Chairman Jordan for their leadership, and I thank my Democratic colleagues, Representatives Lofgren, Jayapal, and Jacobs for their hard work to get this bill to the floor. I encourage my colleagues to vote “yes” on this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time."""
April 19,Jodey Arrington,R,Tex.-19,Arrington Offers Amendment to Offset Cost of National Security Supplemental,"Today, U.S. Representatives Scott Perry (PA-10), Thomas Massie (KY-04), Mary Miller (IL-15), and Andy Ogles (TN-05) introduced the No Propaganda Act to defund the biased Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB). The organization and its subsidiaries are staffed by extreme liberals, including the newly appointed divisive CEO of the National Public Radio (NPR) who has openly campaigned for Joe Biden.  “The American Taxpayer is footing the bill for a woke media corporation that pretends to be impartial while pushing Chinese propaganda,” said Rep. Perry. “CPB cannot be allowed to keep using your hard-earned tax dollars to push a biased and political agenda that goes against what’s best for Americans.” Claiming to be unbiased and serving in the best interest of the public, the CPB funds content that incorporates woke and divisive messaging. A whistleblower, and 25-year veteran of NPR, recently called out NPR for allowing its “pro-Democrat political leanings to seep into editorial judgments, including its decision to turn a blind eye to the Hunter Biden laptop story.” In addition to influencing public opinion about U.S. politics, CPB has worked with a Chinese Communist Party-controlled media outlet registered as a foreign agent to air a documentary promoting Chinese propaganda. These efforts are funded in part by CPB grants paid for by American Citizens.   “Congress must exercise oversight of the CPB and stop corruption in its tracks,” said Rep. Andy Ogles. “Taxpayers fund the CPB and it should be a source that provides a truly neutral and balanced perspective. That can only be achieved through the diversity of political ideology. Recent reports from a whistleblower indicate the CPB is nothing more than a propaganda machine for the Democrat party. I thank Congressman Perry for leading this bill to defund it and I’m proud to cosponsor.”"
April 16,Veronica Escobar,D,Tex.-16,"Reps. Escobar, Castro Lead Letter on NSM20 and U.S. Origin Weapons in Israel","In a House Appropriations Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee budget hearing for the U.S. Forest Service today, Ranking Member Congresswoman Chellie Pingree (D-Maine) called attention to the severe storms Maine has endured in recent months, which have impacted local economies, infrastructure, and forests.  “Maine’s logging industry suffered more than $2.6 million in losses from the December storm alone, and has a domino effect on the Maine economy, with larger losses estimated at over $5.5 million. Many of these companies will be unable to file insurance claims because the losses aren’t covered,” Pingree noted in the hearing. Pingree asked U.S. Forest Service Chief Randy Moore how the Forest Service takes impacts of extreme weather events into consideration when managing partners’ forests and related industries.


 A complete transcript of the exchange is copied below. Click here to watch the full hearing. +++ Pingree: So, the state private and tribal forestry account provides vital financial and technical assistance to nonfederal landowners and resource managers in my home state. The Maine Forest Service has a long history of using these resources to provide services to small woodland owners, loggers, and foresters. But the state and private funding only goes so far. In the last few months, Maine has experienced four major storms that caused widespread water quality issues, washed out roads and bridges, and caused negative impacts to the health of the forests. Maine's logging industry suffered more than $2.6 million in losses for just one of those storms - the December storm alone - and has a domino effect on the Maine economy, with larger losses estimated at over $5.5 million. Many of the companies will be unable to file insurance claims because the losses aren't covered. I've seen some of the devastating pictures of road washouts. And, you know, you know, it's a short season when you can move trees and it's not you know, it's not mud, it's not snowed in. So, it's been a huge problem for them. So how is the Forest Service taking into consideration the impact of this extreme weather we're experiencing on the management of partners, forests and related industry and is providing more resources for this simply a matter of increasing the funding to state private and tribal forestry accounts or are there some other funding possibilities that a partner like the Maine Forest Service could explore?   We're just anxious to help them and we want to know what your thoughts are and any resources we should be looking at.  Chief Moore: So, Ranking Member, First, let me say that we can and we do request funding through the congressionally required disaster unfunded needs report that's provided. And so, we have received funding there. But to give you an idea of the requests versus the need is pretty significant. We have about $1 billion right now in backlog from request that's needed to respond to many of these disasters across country. And so, the request is one thing. Do we get enough to repair the damage? The answer is no, we don't, but it's helpful. And so, we want you to know how much we appreciate Congress response to our requests. You just said many of these things, more of them are happening, it seems. And whether you believe that is from climate differences, climate change or whatever it may be, it's happening more often. And so the requests are asked more often. And we understand the budget situation. We we fully understand that. But I do want you to know that there's a lot of damage out there. We did receive the 2023 funding requests for prior years, and it still wasn't enough. Like I say, we've got $1 billion backlog of what's needed versus what's been requested. ###  "
April 18,Veronica Escobar,D,Tex.-16,Congresswoman Escobar Urges Speaker Johnson to Fund Affordable Internet Program,"Congresswoman Chellie Pingree (D-Maine), Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, today emphasized the importance of bolstering climate change resilience and supporting tribal co-stewardship in Acadia National Park and other national parks across the county. In a budget hearing this morning with Department of the Interior (DOI) Secretary Deb Haaland, Pingree highlighted new funding from the Inflation Reduction Act for Acadia National Park, which will be used to implement the “Two-Eyed Seeing” model to meaningfully integrate Indigenous Knowledge with western science.  “The project will build on 15 years of consultation at Acadia National Park, Saint Croix Island International Historic Site, and Roosevelt Campobello International Park with the Wabanaki Tribes,” Pingree said during the hearing. “This is just one example of the amazing work the Inflation Reduction [Act] funding will support to prepare parks across the country to be resilient to climate change.” In February, the National Park Service announced $195 million for climate restoration and resilience projects over the next decade.  Secretary Haaland said the National Park Service’s budget includes $4 million for additional climate vulnerability studies and $2.5 million for climate related natural resource projects at the national parks.  “As you know, more than one third of coastal parks are at significant risk from sea level rise, coastal erosion and storm surge that's happening on all of our coasts,” Secretary Haaland said. “[…] Both of those investments could help the National Park Service make progress in addressing climate resiliency.” Pingree also called attention to the severe back-to-back storms Maine endured in recent months, refuting Rep. Ryan Zinke’s (R-Mont.) assertion that sea level rise is not due to climate change.  “You can say that there's some kind of tectonic plate shift going on or this isn't really real or whatever, but I invite you to come to my communities. These are fishermen. These are communities that are going to disappear, not to mention the tribal communities,” Pingree said. “[…] I thoroughly invite any anyone from this committee come spend some time in my district and see the coast of Maine. We’d love to have you. But you're going to you're going to see some tears in the eyes of fishermen and people.”


 +++   Clip 1:  Pingree:  Last week, Acadia National Park announced that the park will be receiving $950,000 in funding from the Inflation Reduction Act to create a model for addressing climate change vulnerabilities of coastal archeological sites, collections, landscapes and ethnographic resources. Something we we've we have a lot of in Maine, including in my own community. Acadia will be using the “Two-Eyed Seeing” model to meaningfully integrate indigenous knowledge with Western science. The project will build on 15 years of consultation at Acadia National Park, Saint Croix Island International Historic Site and Roosevelt Campobello International Park with the Wabanaki Tribes. This is just one example of the amazing work the Inflation Reduction [Act] funding will support to prepare parks across the country to be resilient to climate change. The National Park Service just announced projects to be funded by the full $195 million.  So could you just tell me I know a little bit about what's going on in my own state, but I'd like to know what other types of work are going on and how the funding will work to support the work across the park system.  Sec. Haaland: Yes. Thank you so much. We have been extremely proud of the work we've been able to do with tribes. I appreciate you mentioning indigenous knowledge. We believe very strongly that that is science that we all need to pay attention to, and it is really helping us to steward these lands through our tribal co stewardship agreements across the country. We've signed probably 200 of those, and there's probably 60 more that are that we're working on to ensure that we are that we're not missing anything because tribes have the experience more. And as you know, yes, more than one third of coastal parks are at significant risk from sea level rise, coastal erosion and storm surge that's happening on all of our coasts. The NPS budget includes $4 million for additional climate vulnerability studies and $2.5 million for climate related natural resource projects at the parks. Both of those investments could help the National Park Service make progress in addressing climate resiliency. We'll keep our eyes on that and continue to work as needed and certainly bring tribes into the fold when it comes to how we steward those lands.  +++ Clip 2: Zinke: Have you ever heard the term glacial isostatic adjustment? Sec. Haaland: I have not.  Zinke: Okay. So glacial isostatic adjustment on the East Coast is because we had glaciers, large, thick, heavy glaciers on the plate to the north in Maine, all the way down to Jersey. So when that plate moves and you have the glaciers on it and the glaciers are removed over time, there is an ice or static adjustment. So if you read that report, it would have talked about it and also would have talked about sea level rise versus depression. And I know you're probably not aware, but the sea level rise fully compensated for also the shift. The sinking is about one millimeter a year. […] Pingree: I guess I can't help myself. I want to mention something about sea level rise since you brought it up, our current Mr. Chair, and I really appreciate your willingness to focus on this, whether it's the tribes or other states. I guess I just have to say I'm happy to read the 2017 report. It is seven years and a lot has changed.  And I think, um maybe because you're in Montana, you don't see what I see in in the on the coast of Maine. So I'd be happy to invite you out any time or anyone on the committee who would like to take a look at this, who has some concerns about whether or not this is real. And I don't know about glacial isostatic adjustment, but I'm going to learn all about it. But I just want to tell you, this year we had two back-to-back severe storms. And I I'm sure in 2017, nobody in my community a fishing town 12 miles off the coast of Maine on an island, thought there would ever be anything like we saw this year. Two back-to-back storms. We have a 180-year-old ship boatyard, basically in our district, in our little town of 400. Everybody turned out between the first and the second storm because they were so worried that this building that's been there forever and the fishermen depend on was going to wash away. They had block and tackles and chains. They put cement blocks on the floor. They did everything they could possibly think of to try to hold it on land, to try to keep it there. And right now, we don't know if it'll survive. It got through that storm. It got through the second storm, but we're probably going to lose it. And you can come visit the coast to Maine and see up and down the coast of Maine, 150-year-old piers everywhere, communities like Stonington, Maine, fishing towns, they're washing away. This was a tide like we had never seen before in a storm surge from the southeast, which is weather we used to never have before. So you can say that there's some kind of tectonic plate shift going on or this isn't really real or whatever, but I invite you to come to my communities. These are fishermen. These are communities that are going to disappear, not to mention the tribal communities. I'm just talking about our fishing towns, our community piers. They're going away. This tide this tide is higher than we have ever imagined could happen to us. And it's not even there yet. It's not even anywhere near what the maps say. Places that are peninsulas are going to turn into islands. Communities are losing their sewer systems, their infrastructure. It's all going away.  So it's one thing to sit inland in Montana. You get mountains, you can run to the top, but we don't have those options. And however we want to describe why this is happening, I just want to thank you, Madam Secretary, in your department for putting this focus on because this is extremely real to us. It's very emotional to us. It's the end of so many of our communities and we don't know where we're going to get the money to deal with all this. We don't know how we're going to move to higher ground when there isn't higher ground or it's already filled up. Our island communities, our coastal communities. This is really serious to us. So thank you for your attention to us.  I thoroughly invite any anyone from this committee come spend some time in my district and see the coast of Maine. We’d love to have you. But you're going to you're going to see some tears in the eyes of fishermen and people. Hard core Republican conservatives who don't always vote for me, but they want to know what we're going to do about this. And I invite you to join us in doing that.  Sec. Haaland: Ranking Member If I could just say very quickly, Maine was one of the first places I visited when I came into this position … at Acadia National Park and so I, I just want you to know that we care deeply about every single community that is facing these issues. It's, you know, it's American traditions, the fishermen. And we equate that with when we think about those fishermen, we think about your state. So it's it is heartbreaking when you think that these are lives of people that are getting washed away. And so we're doing everything we possibly can to address the issues.  Pingree: I thank you for that and I thank you for visiting our state. The challenge is and I think this is what many of us saw this winter that we'd never really had really had knowledge in this visceral way. This is so much bigger than any one of us. This is so much bigger than the budget that we have. This is so much bigger than our petty arguments about what's real and not real. You just got to come and see it to understand. And if it can happen twice this winter, you know what's coming next year. Who knows? ###"
April 16,Donald Beyer,D,Va.-8,Beyer Presents Award To Arlington Crime Survivors Advocate Candice Lopez,"Click to Watch Mr. Secretary, recent analysis expects seniors are paying over 20% more on average for their monthly Medicare Part D premiums this year as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), with that increase reaching as high as 57% in some places like your home state of California.  We’re expecting those costs to increase even more in 2025. There is also evidence to suggest that 2024 will have the lowest number of independent Medicare Part D standalone plans offered to seniors since 2006. I understand this is because of some of the Part D redesign policies in the IRA, such as the $2,000 out of pocket cap, that is driving these increases. To be clear, Republicans supported a Part D out of pocket cap in the bipartisan H.R. 19, but wanted to be sure this was done in a way that we could avoid the premium hikes seniors are expected to see.  
Mr. Secretary, we’ve already seen almost 10,000 pounds of illicit fentanyl seized at our Southern border this fiscal year alone, and yet, your budget only mentions fentanyl once in the footnotes. One thing you can do that’s squarely in your jurisdiction is apply Title 42 policy to halt illicit narcotics from being trafficked across our Southern border from other countries.

April 18,Donald Beyer,D,Va.-8,Beyer Introduces Legislation to Protect Streams and Lands Impacted by Mining,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - Congressman Brett Guthrie (KY-02), released the following statement after voting for numerous House Republican bills and resolutions this week in support of our greatest ally in the Middle East, Israel:
 “This week I was honored to stand with my House Republican colleagues in support of America’s greatest ally in the Middle East, Israel. Over the weekend Israel was attacked, yet again, in an unprecedented fashion by the Iranian regime. After President Biden removed Iranian backed terror groups from the terror watchlist, he enabled these groups, like the Houthis, to gain strength, only to the detriment of our allies in the region. Under Republican leadership, the House voted to reaffirm our commitment to Israel, sanction Iran, and send critical aid to the Israeli people. I was proud to support these measures and believe we must continue to stand with our neighbors in Israel as they defend their homeland from those who wish to completely eliminate the Jewish state,” said Congressman Guthrie. Background House Republicans passed a number of bills this week to support the Israeli people in light of recent attacks both by Iran and Hamas terrorists. These include:  o This expands secondary sanctions involving Iran to cover all transactions between Chinese financial institutions and sanctioned Iranian banks that transact for the purchase of petroleum and petroleum products. o   This resolution condemns Iran’s recent attacks on Israel, reaffirms and supports Israel’s right to self-defense, and urges full enforcement of the United States’ sanctions and export controls against Iran. o This requires Iran to have ceased support for acts of international terrorism as a condition for the President to waive secondary sanctions imposed with respect to the country. Also provides for a congressional review process for national security interest waivers (issued by OFAC) of these sanctions.   - Secondary sanctions are economic tools imposed to restrict third-party transactions that non-U.S. persons conduct with foreign targets subject to primary sanctions.  - Secondary sanctions require non-U.S. persons to adhere to U.S. sanctions if they wish to do business with/in the U.S. o This legislation establishes a review period for Congress to examine executive actions that ease or waive sanctions on Iran.  o The bill requires the President to submit a report to Congress detailing the administration’s proposed action and how it affects the United States’ national security and foreign policy interests in relation to Iran.  o It also establishes expedited legislative procedures by which both chambers of Congress may pass a joint approval or disapproval resolution allowing or prohibiting the President’s actions with respect to Iran.    ###

April 16,Debbie Dingell,D,Mich.-6,Dingell Elected Democratic Policy and Communications Committee Chair,"WASHINGTON, DC – Representative Kevin Hern (OK-01) released the following statement regarding tomorrow’s vote on a supplemental funding package for Ukraine.  “This supplemental package fails to address the number one crisis for the American people - the invasion at our southern border,” said Rep. Hern. “I have long promised never to vote for more Ukraine funding without strong border security provisions to protect Americans. We have no business sending tens of billions of dollars to Ukraine while doing absolutely nothing to end the crisis on our own Southern border. I was one of the first Members of Congress to take this stand against further Ukraine funding without border security, and there isn’t anything that will make me change my beliefs on this. The American people deserve better.” ### Paid for by House of Representatives for the 1st District of Oklahoma"

I commend President Biden's decision to fully enforce the terms of the Barbados Agreement by snapping back sanctions on the Maduro dictatorship's illicit oil profits. I know the people I represent appreciate the Administration's commitment to amplify the voices of Venezuelan Americans who demand democracy. ""The need for action was clear: The regime refused to register opposition candidate María Corina Machado or her substitute, Dr. Corina Yoris, and Maduro has demonstrated his cruel neglect for his obligation to provide for a free and fair election by continuing to terrorize, harass or imprison human rights defenders, charitable organizations, and journalists.  ""These unacceptable breaches of the Barbados Agreement, a good-faith effort by the President and Venezuela's democratic opposition, which was agreed to by Maduro and designed to make progress towards a return to democracy, have been met with a swift and forceful response.  ""As co-chair of the Congressional Venezuela Democracy Caucus, I am proud that President Biden is taking deliberate action to promote democracy and hold Maduro's brutal regime accountable. I look forward to continuing my legislative efforts to complement the President's policy, including the VOICE Act, which would sanction corrupt regime officials attempting to rig Venezuela's presidential election and disenfranchise millions of Venezuelans.""  #### Receive regular email updates from Debbie"

Clarke (NY-09) issued the following statement regarding her vote against H.Res.883. “As a representative of one of the nation’s most diverse districts, including a large Jewish community, I understand the fear sparked by Iran’s attack on Israel. History shows that such events tragically lead to increased antisemitic violence worldwide. We must treat all threats against our Jewish communities with utmost seriousness. That’s why I voted against H.Res.883. “This resolution is a cynical ploy by House Republicans to distract from the real issues facing our communities. It dangerously conflates a slogan with antisemitism, undermining genuine efforts to combat hatred. Even more concerning, this resolution accomplishes nothing to combat antisemitism. Instead, it’s a thinly-veiled attempt by House Republicans to deflect responsibility for their inaction on this urgent issue. “We cannot play politics with the safety of our communities, and the recent spike in antisemitism across the nation presents a grave threat that requires every single one of us to band together against all forms of hatred. We cannot play politics with the safety of our communities. We have a moral responsibility to protect them from hate and fear, and it’s shameful to trivialize the alarming rise in antisemitism. Throughout my career, I have tirelessly worked to fight against antisemitism and all forms of hate. H.Res.883 trivializes the alarming rise in antisemitism. It is nothing but a performative gesture when we need real solutions to the serious threat of the rise of antisemitism.” ###

April 19,Angus King,ID,Me.,"Free National Park Entry This Saturday as King, Daines Celebrate Resolution Commemorating National Park Week","            As concerns continue to mount over Verizon’s plans to install twenty 30-foot towers along the boardwalk in Belmar, Rep. Chris Smith (R-Manchester) today introduced legislation (HR 8082) that would empower local residents impacted by proposed 5G projects and would rein in the power of telecommunication giants to fast track their rollout of 5G wireless, steamrolling community opposition in the process.             Specifically, Smith’s bill would nullify two administrative regulations issued by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 2018 that unfairly advantage industry by imposing “shot clocks” and other tools that limit the input of town and county governments when it comes to the construction and proliferation of the significant infrastructure needed to advance 5G wireless.             “My legislation will repeal these harmful regulations that have been exploited by providers to limit county and municipal governments—and blatantly disregard reasonable concerns of local citizens,” said Smith. “HR 8082 will restore the critical role that residents should play when considering the health, safety and aesthetic of their community,” said Smith.              Smith’s legislation comes as the legal battle over Verizon’s aggressive push to install 20 5G towers in Belmar ramps up. Just last month, a group of Belmar residents joined Monmouth County in ongoing litigation regarding the 30-foot towers, citing concerns over the potential detrimental impact on the aesthetic quality of their neighborhood, the local environment and wildlife, and their property values.             “The implementation of 5G can help our economy and telecommunications networks, but it cannot and should not be done at the expense of valued local input or under unreasonable time restraints,” said Smith. “There can and should be a balance between the concerns and needs of the local community and the desires of providers of utility and telecommunication services.”             In a letter to Verizon last year, Smith urged the telecommunications giant to heed the extensive concerns of the local community and rescind its plan to install 20 5G towers in Belmar. Smith penned the letter as Verizon’s push to install the 5G towers in Belmar entered a new phase with the telecommunications corporation turning its sights to the County of Monmouth—the lawful owner of the boardwalk property—after wrongfully suing the Borough of Belmar for access to the land.              “American democracy is supposed to be about the consent of the governed,” said Smith.              “Clearly, there is no consent here and we again implore Verizon to work with the correct authority—i.e. the County—to reexamine the substantial objections raised by members of the local community and respond with transparency and consideration for Belmar residents, Belmar’s tourism, and those of the other shore municipalities along the coast of NJ.”   ### Chris has three offices dedicated to constituent services.

April 16,Dan Sullivan,R,Alaska,Sullivan Condemns Biden for “Sanctioning Alaska More than Terrorist Regimes” Like Iran,"April 18, 2024 For Immediate Release Contact: Taylor Haulsee   Speaker Johnson joined Newsmax to discuss the House’s national security supplemental   WASHINGTON — This evening, Speaker Johnson joined “The Record” with Greta Van Susteren to discuss the difference in the House national security supplemental legislation and the Senate foreign aid package, and crucial border security measures.    Click here to watch the full interview.   On the House national security supplemental:   What we did was we rejected the Senate supplemental bill because it was everything merged into one and it didn’t have some of these important features that we want in the bill. So, we redrafted it and we’re going to send them a House supplemental bill, it’s very different. For one thing, we broke it into four pieces. We have the Israel component, the Ukraine component, the Indo-Pacific component, and then we have a fourth bill that is in this package, that has a lot of our innovations included like the REPO Act, where we use the seized assets of corrupt Russian oligarchs to fund the opposition in Ukraine.   Everybody thinks that makes sense. President Trump is credited with really advancing this idea of the loan concept to your point and so what we’ve done is we say any of the funding that goes to Ukraine for this governmental assistance is in the form of a loan that’s in our package that are the House will be voting on early Saturday.   The rule has been finished up tonight to make that possible. We’ve also included a lot of other things like increasing sanctions against Iran and Russia. We’re going to change the strategy and have a lot more oversight and accountability over the funds because that’s what the American people deserve. But as I’ve said so many times in the last 24 hours, you know, I’d rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys, we don’t want to have boots on the ground, and we can prevent that by allowing them to hold Putin at bay.   On oversight of humanitarian aid:    We’ve required in the House’s version of this strict accountability. The White House has to give reports of the funds and we ban any of that funding from going to UNRWA to, you know, any of the UN agencies that are involved with any of the terrorist organizations. These are really, really important things. This is the precious treasure of the American people.   On border security:   The border is the number one priority of the House Republicans, we fight for it here every single day. I’ve been doing it since I became Speaker and way before. Since Joe Biden entered the Oval Office, he’s created an absolute catastrophe at the border. And you and I don’t need to recount all the statistics and the parade of horrible that has come out of that we must fix it.   The American people demand it and we fight every day. I’ve been trying to push the president to use his executive authority to close that border and he refuses to do it. We passed HR 2, our signature legislation, the Secure the Border Act. It would fix every one of these problems. It’s been sitting on Chuck Schumer’s desk for over a year. We have continued to work every single day we’ve passed resolution.     ###

April 16,Dan Sullivan,R,Alaska,"As Biden Moves to Shut Down NPR-Alaska, Sullivan & Colleagues Warn Biden Not To Renew Oil Sanctions Relief For Venezuela’s Dictatorship","For Immediate Release Contact: Taylor Haulsee   WASHINGTON — Read “Mike Johnson Makes His Case on Ukraine,” in this morning’s Wall Street Journal editorial page:   Mike Johnson Makes His Case on Ukraine The Speaker puts his job on the line, in a welcome show of leadership Wall Street Journal Editorial Board April 19, 2024   Speaker Mike Johnson is teeing up votes in the House on U.S. aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan to take place this weekend, even as Republican critics in the bleachers threaten his job. Mr. Johnson deserves credit for his show of conviction, which represents the best of the GOP in the tradition of Ronald Reagan.   “This is a critical time right now, a critical time on the world stage,” Mr. Johnson told reporters on Wednesday. “I think providing lethal aid to Ukraine right now is critically important. I really do. I really do believe the intel and the briefings that we’ve gotten. I believe Xi [Jinping] and Vladimir Putin and Iran really are an axis of evil. I think they’re in coordination on this. I think that Vladimir Putin would continue to march through Europe if he were allowed.”   And “to put it bluntly,” Mr. Johnson added, “I would rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys. My son is going to begin in the Naval Academy this fall. This is a live-fire exercise for me, as it is so many American families.”   He is correct about the global nature of the threat. American weakness in Europe increases the odds that U.S. troops will eventually be forced into a fight, either on that continent or elsewhere in the world.   One certainty is that you won’t hear Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene address these substantive points. The Republican malcontents are shouting about supposed betrayal and that Mr. Johnson should focus on the crisis at the southern border.   But they know he’d pass border measures in a heartbeat if he had the votes in the House. The options now are to consign Ukraine to defeat or try to hold the line against Mr. Putin, and the latter is still possible even after months of Washington dithering.   “I’m going to allow an opportunity for every single member of the House to vote their conscience and their will on this,” Mr. Johnson noted. “I think that’s the way this institution is supposed to work,” and the irony is that the House’s rump right flank would agree if he were moving a measure they favor.   “And I’m willing to take personal risk for that,” he said. That risk includes putting his Speakership on the line amid threats from Ms. Greene and Rep. Thomas Massie to try to topple him if he holds votes on these bills. If they do attempt this, we’ll see if Democrats are willing to put country before partisanship and vote down the coup.   Mr. Johnson’s behavior is called leadership, and the GOP would be more popular and better able to govern if more of its members showed such mettle themselves—or had more respect for those who demonstrate it.   Appeared in the April 19, 2024, print edition as ‘Mike Johnson Makes His Case on Ukraine’.   ###

April 18,Dan Sullivan,R,Alaska,Sullivan: “What a Dangerous World This President Has Created” as Biden Administration Continues Sanctions on American Energy,"CQ Roll Call April 15, 2024  California Democrat Nanette Barragán, chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and other Congressional Tri-Caucus leaders are calling for the restoration of the House Office of Diversity and Inclusion after its funding was slashed.  Republican appropriators zeroed out $3.5 million for the diversity office in the fiscal 2024 package enacted in March (PL 118-47). Barragán joined Congressional Black Caucus Chair Steven Horsford, D-Nev., and Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus Chair Judy Chu, D-Calif., in an April 8 letter to Democratic leaders calling for restoration of funding in the future.  “Republican lawmakers are so eager to score political points by eliminating all diversity and inclusion programs that they undercut a non-partisan office that dozens of their own Members have used to identify highly qualified candidates that they went on to hire,” the group wrote. House Republicans have been critical of the office, claiming it had become partisan. Getting to Congress: Barragán took her first steps into politics with a role in the White House’s Office of Public Liaison under the Clinton administration. She worked as a lawyer before winning a seat on the Hermosa Beach City Council. Barragán served on the city council for two years, including a short stint as mayor, before throwing her hat in the race to replace Democratic Rep. Janice Hahn, who left Congress in 2016. Barragán pulled off an upset victory against Democratic State Sen. Isadore Hall, the California Democratic Party’s preferred candidate.  Her District: The 44th District is an urban district encompassing parts of Los Angeles and Long Beach in Southern California. A major economic driver is the Port of Los Angeles. The port has ranked as the busiest container shipping port in the Western hemisphere since 2000 and is a key connection for trade with Asia, according to statistics released by port officials. Nearly $300 billion worth of cargo passed through the port in 2023. The predominantly Hispanic district is a Democratic stronghold, and Barragán won her last election with over 72 percent of the vote. What’s New: Barragán criticized Democrats in February for excluding members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus from negotiations over border provisions included in an initial version of a foreign aid package (HR 815). “Imagine a civil rights or criminal justice bill negotiated without the Congressional Black Caucus at the table,” Barragán said in a Feb. 5 statement. That proposal stalled in the Senate after a majority of Republicans swiftly came out against the border agreement, despite having insisted for months that they would only support additional aid for Ukraine if it was accompanied with tighter border security provisions. The following week, the Senate passed a $95.3 billion security supplemental without the border deal. Point of Interest: Since coming to Washington, Barragán has been a regular participant in the Congressional Women’s Softball Game, an annual charity match between lawmakers and members of the press. Barragán, who also plays in other congressional sporting events, made her high school baseball team, but ultimately joined the softball team instead after receiving flak from boys. “And the guys weren’t very good,” she said.

April 18,Dan Sullivan,R,Alaska,"Alaska Delegation Leads Effort to Delay Alaska Air National Guard Cuts, Protect Defense in the Arctic","It is widely known that Iran is the largest state sponsor of terror on earth. Through its proxies like Hamas and Hezbollah, it funds dozens of attacks on Israel and other U.S. allies every year. Over the weekend, Iran launched a direct attack on Israel by firing hundreds of missiles and drones with the goal of indiscriminately killing as many Israelis as possible. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which is essentially the Iranian government and a terrorist group itself, claims these acts where somehow an act of defense. If it weren’t so serious and dangerous, that claim would be laughable. The IRGC has been attacking Israel for decades and was the primary sponsor and supporter of Hamas’ terrorist attack on October 7th.  We’ve talked a lot about sanctions over the last weeks, months, and even years. As I’m writing this, the White House is promising new, hard-hitting sanctions on Iran. But sanctions aren’t new. We’ve actually been sanctioning Iran since the late 1970s. So, it begs the question: how is Iran funding all of these attacks, continuing to build its nuclear capabilities, and growing the wealth of the people at the very top of its government? Like Russia, Iran is quite skilled at getting around U.S. and European sanctions. They do this in many ways including utilizing shell companies to launder money and stealing humanitarian aid from their own people. While thinking about how Iran and Russia evade sanctions, it also raises the question: how did we get to a point where we’re talking about more sanctions in response to some of the worst people on the planet so cavalierly attacking humanity? That question is easier to answer. The Biden Administration’s refusal to lead has emboldened our adversaries. The 2021 withdraw from Afghanistan – often touted as an achievement by Biden and his Cabinet – not only killed 13 U.S. service members, but it also gave the green light to terrorist organizations in the Middle East to take over and wreak havoc. Because bad news spreads fast, other nefarious actors, like Putin, followed suit. In February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine in an attempt to rebuild the Soviet Union. On October 7th, 2023, Hamas claimed over 1,200 lives, 32 of which were American, in the brutal attack against Israel. Every day, the Chinese Communist Party persistently spies on American citizens and infiltrates our economy, all while edging closer to waging war against Taiwan.  These places, dates and events don’t even scratch the surface of the impact war, let alone terrorism has on a nation and its economy, people and longevity. We can’t stop every bad person from doing bad things. Maniacs like Putin and IRGC leader Hossein Salami will always be evil. But we can make it more difficult for Iran to achieve their goals. This week the House passed several bills to directly combat Iran’s ability to fund terrorism. One of them was my bill, the Iran Sanctions Accountability Act. For decades, our sanctions have allowed for humanitarian aid for ordinary civilians. Because of that, it is our duty to ensure aid is reaching the intended recipients. My bill forces the Administration to put certain mechanisms in place to ensure humanitarian aid cannot be stolen from the Iranian people and diverted to other parts of Iran's budget to be spent on bombs, missiles, and drone attacks. In passing The Iran Sanctions Accountability Act, Congress is ensuring any future humanitarian aid to Iran undergoes rigorous due diligence. I stand by my decision to support Israel and always have. As a nation, Israel has a fundamental right to defend themselves and deserves support from their allies whether it be via the Iron Dome –which numerous House Democrats tried to defund – or through backing them in their fight against terrorists invading their soil. The world has exploited the Administration’s weakness for over three years now. It’s time to draw a line in the sand and, if crossed, respond with the full force of the most powerful nation on earth.

April 19,Dan Sullivan,R,Alaska,"Delegation Slams Biden Decisions to Further Restrict, Deny Resource Development in Alaska","Last weekend, I hosted my annual Service Academy Day at the New River Community College in Dublin.   I enjoy these events as they provide great opportunities for high school students, parents and educators to learn about Service Academies, Army Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC), and other programs.   I take pride in allowing students in Southwest Virginia to have access to opportunities to admirably pursue a career in military service.   The Ninth District is home to many patriotic men and women, and we also have a rich tradition of service.   A major piece of our history involves the D-Day invasion of Normandy during World War II. When Company A stormed Omaha Beach on June 6, 1944, there were 35 soldiers from Bedford. By the end of the campaign, 23 would be dead, making Bedford, Virginia, the town with the highest per capita deaths.   Bedford commemorates this sacrifice by true Virginia heroes with its National D-Day Memorial.    Bedford is Virginia’s only WWII Heritage City.   I am honored that it is in the Ninth District.   Given our rich heritage, I host Service Academy Days to tap into the patriotic spirit of our youth. Families and children travel from across the Ninth District to attend and get more information. Some even attend from other states.   Invited guests typically include representatives from the U.S. Military Academy, U.S. Naval Academy, U.S. Air Force Academy, U.S. Coast Guard Academy, U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, Virginia Military Institute, Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets, Virginia Tech ROTC, and Emory & Henry ROTC.   The representatives from these programs consist of current and former cadets, admissions officers and ROTC directors and students who actively engage with interested individuals and discuss their options for a college military experience.   As a Congressman, I am permitted to fill five vacancies over a four-year period at each Academy, with the exception of U.S. Merchant Marine.   While U.S. Merchant Marine is not a popular selection for many in Southwest Virginia, I can fill ten vacancies each year there.   Once the U.S. Merchant Marine program is completed, the participant becomes eligible for commission into any branch of the U.S. military, provided that they are in good standing.    ROTC programs are another option. They are great at providing leadership and physical training exercises for students while they continue their academic studies at their university or college.   Some historians trace the roots of ROTC programs to the Morrill Act of 1862, also known as the Land Grant Act of 1862. This was signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln.   At the time, there was a stark decline in the numbers of trained engineers present in American colleges and universities.    The Land Grant Act laid the groundwork for a national system of state universities. The bill granted 30,000 acres of public land to each state for the establishment of institutions of scientific learning. The land grant institutions reciprocated by offering military tactics courses.    Virginia Tech maintains a strong record in this space. Their campus features a War Memorial Court, dedicated to the eight VT alumni who are medal of honor recipients. Close to the War Memorial Chapel is a marble cenotaph with their names etched into it.   VT sponsors a ROTC program, as well as VT Corps of Cadets.   The mission of the VT Corps of Cadets program is to nurture and create great leaders. The four-year program draws upon exercises that target teamwork, character and problem-solving skills. This is designed to develop leadership qualities among our brave servicemen and women and shape future leaders within our military.   The VT Corps of Cadets prides itself in giving back to the community. In the 2022-2023 academic school year, cadets collected over 2,000 hours of community service.     I was proud to hear that my alma mater, Emory & Henry College, relaunched their own Army ROTC program in 2018 after nearly a century.    As of 2018, Emory & Henry became one of only five private institutions in Virginia to offer an ROTC program.     Another Virginia private institution that comes to my event is VMI.   VMI has an extensive recruitment network. VMI excels in showcasing their opportunities and highlighting their illustrious history of producing exceptional military talents, the likes of whom include former U.S. Secretary of Defense, George C. Marshall, Jr.   If you or someone you know is interested in applying to attend one of our academies, please contact Josh Hess at josh.hess@mail.house.gov or (540) 381-5671.   If you have questions, concerns, or comments, feel free to contact my office.  You can call my Abingdon office at 276-525-1405 or my Christiansburg office at 540-381-5671.  To reach my office via email, please visit my website at https://morgangriffith.house.gov.  Also on my website is the latest material from my office, including information on votes recently taken on the floor of the House of Representatives.   ### Enter your email address to get the latest updates straight to your inbox.

April 12,Amy Klobuchar,D,Minn.,"Klobuchar, Smith Secure Funding for Projects in Hennepin County","April 18, 2024 For Immediate Release Contact: Taylor Haulsee Speaker Johnson joined Newsmax to discuss the House’s national security supplemental   WASHINGTON — This evening, Speaker Johnson joined “The Record” with Greta Van Susteren to discuss the difference in the House national security supplemental legislation and the Senate foreign aid package, and crucial border security measures.     Click here to watch the full interview.   On the House national security supplemental:   What we did was we rejected the Senate supplemental bill because it was everything merged into one and it didn’t have some of these important features that we want in the bill. So, we redrafted it and we’re going to send them a House supplemental bill, it’s very different. For one thing, we broke it into four pieces. We have the Israel component, the Ukraine component, the Indo-Pacific component, and then we have a fourth bill that is in this package, that has a lot of our innovations included like the REPO Act, where we use the seized assets of corrupt Russian oligarchs to fund the opposition in Ukraine.   Everybody thinks that makes sense. President Trump is credited with really advancing this idea of the loan concept to your point and so what we’ve done is we say any of the funding that goes to Ukraine for this governmental assistance is in the form of a loan that’s in our package that are the House will be voting on early Saturday.   The rule has been finished up tonight to make that possible. We’ve also included a lot of other things like increasing sanctions against Iran and Russia. We’re going to change the strategy and have a lot more oversight and accountability over the funds because that’s what the American people deserve. But as I’ve said so many times in the last 24 hours, you know, I’d rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys, we don’t want to have boots on the ground, and we can prevent that by allowing them to hold Putin at bay.   On oversight of humanitarian aid:    We’ve required in the House’s version of this strict accountability. The White House has to give reports of the funds and we ban any of that funding from going to UNRWA to, you know, any of the UN agencies that are involved with any of the terrorist organizations. These are really, really important things. This is the precious treasure of the American people.   On border security:   The border is the number one priority of the House Republicans, we fight for it here every single day. I’ve been doing it since I became Speaker and way before. Since Joe Biden entered the Oval Office, he’s created an absolute catastrophe at the border. And you and I don’t need to recount all the statistics and the parade of horrible that has come out of that we must fix it.   The American people demand it and we fight every day. I’ve been trying to push the president to use his executive authority to close that border and he refuses to do it. We passed HR 2, our signature legislation, the Secure the Border Act. It would fix every one of these problems. It’s been sitting on Chuck Schumer’s desk for over a year. We have continued to work every single day we’ve passed resolution.     ###

April 16,Amy Klobuchar,D,Minn.,"At Senate Judiciary Subcommittee Hearing, Klobuchar Urges Action to Address Deepfakes in Elections","For Immediate Release Contact: Taylor Haulsee   Speaker Johnson joined the Mark Levin Show to make the case for the House version of the national security supplemental legislation   WASHINGTON — Last night, Speaker Johnson joined the Mark Levin Show to make his case for the House version of the national security supplemental legislation.  Click here to listen to the full interview   On the House improvements to supplemental national security legislation:   Remember that the Senate sent to the House the supplemental foreign aid package, two months ago, right. What we’re doing right now, the House is not passing the Senate supplemental bill, we’re trying to fix that with some better policy and a better process.   We took that that bill that had lumped Israel aid, Ukraine and the Indo-Pacific together, and we broke it into separate pieces so that in the House, everyone can vote up or down on their merits, each one of those items, and then we added a fourth bill to it… which is kind of a supplemental, and it has some of our policies and some of our preferences in there, where we make it tougher on Iran and Russia and China with sanctions.   And we add the REPO Act, which is a seizure and transfer of about $5 billion in Russian sovereign assets in the US to help Ukraine efforts. Some of the other innovations are things that we all believe that the loan concept, you know, that’s something that President Trump has championed. We added that into this so that the Ukrainian funding that goes to support anything related to the government is a loan instead of a gift.   And we added an amendment process so that the members of the House can vote their will, add things, and subtract things. So that’s what’s happening. It’ll be on the floor on Saturday here in the House, and everybody will get to vote their preferences on that, and I hope at the end, we can take care of our responsibilities.   On the need for standalone bills:   The whole process – the way it’s supposed to work in the House, is single subject distinct issues that we argue and debate and address on their own merits. And that’s what we’ve done here. The Senate likes to lump everything together in these giant omnibus bills. And we don’t believe in that. So, we’re getting back to that regular order, that regular process, and there’ll be lots of thoughtful discussion about it. And you know, I’ve encouraged every one of my colleagues Mark, we’re going to vote on this, get the confidential classified briefings on these things, get the real information, fully armed and equipped when you make such a consequential decision.   On the need to fund Israel’s fight against Hamas:    We have funded Israel as you know, it was within 24 hours of my becoming Speaker back in October, we funded Israel we sent it over with a pay-for. We took the 14 billion out of the IRS, slush fund and then made Israel a priority. Instead, Chuck Schumer ignored it. About a month ago Mark I tried again, I sent them a plain, clean, we call it clean, Israel funding bill, put that on the floor to vote on no pay for it. Send it over. Let’s just take care of Israel and be off the table. 166 House Democrats voted against it. You know why? Because President Biden issued a veto threat a veto threat for a clean Israel funding bill… The Senate Democrats won’t give Israel the funding Mark. The only way that I can you and I and the American people can ensure that Israel gets the help it needs in this desperate hour is to attach it in this foreign supplemental package so that Joe Biden is forced, forced to send the support to Israel.   On House Republicans 1-seat majority:   With regards to a shutdown, they stop paying our troops who are in harm’s way, and they don’t pay TSA agents and everybody across the country starts getting their flights canceled and oh, don’t worry, they won’t be paying the border patrol agents either. So that blame would be shifted to us for not paying them you know, imagine that narrative. Well, guess what? To reopen the government, remembering the numbers, remember, I can only lose one Republican. I’ll have a big group of Republicans who won’t go along with it. It won’t be pure enough for them, whatever the thing is, they won’t reopen it. Which means you’ll have to have Democrats – imagine the deal that we’d have to cut. How much of a pound of flesh to give that we would have to give to get out of that mess. That’s an impossible situation.   On Speaker Johnson’s conservative record:   My entire life, I was in the trenches for the conservative movement. I was a constitutional law attorney like you, and I used to litigate cases to defend our fundamental freedoms in the courts. I did that for 20 years before going into politics. I came into Congress as a constitutional conservative, and I’ve defended those principles that led here and it’s the reason I wound up as Speaker of the House. I mean, I helped President Trump in his impeachment defenses twice. I mean, I’ve done the heavy lifting heavy load here now. We find ourselves in this unprecedented moment in history. It’s a fateful moment in history. And I come out with our core conservative principles and I’m here to advance those as far as I can up the day up the field every single day, inch by inch.   My colleagues here, some of them here, want me to throw a Hail Mary pass on every play Mark. That’s not possible. That’s not a game plan. It’s three yards and a cloud of dust as we used to say when we play football, you got to go inch by inch up the field and get the first down to stay in the game. If we do that, we’re going to win in November. Donald Trump is going to be elected president again. We are going to win a Republican majority in the Senate, and we’re going to keep and grow the majority in the House. And when we have control, totally different ballgame. We can start throwing Hail Mary passes again, we can do those big plays and transformational change and by golly, we’re going to do it. Weve got an aggressive 100 days agenda that we’ll run and fix all this mess.   I told Donald Trump himself a couple days ago: Mr. President, I’m going to state the obvious, in your next term, you could be the most consequential president of a modern era because everything is a disaster, and you can fix it. We run a policy agenda based on our core conservative principles. We will do the greatest service to this country that the history will record, but we got to get there. So, it’s fun to be taking arrows for the reality that we have with the numbers right now? No, but I’m going to do my job and I’m going to stay dug in and I’m not changing who I am or what I believe and I’m going to try to guide this institution.   ###

April 18,Yvette D. Clarke,D,N.Y.-9,CLARKE ISSUES STATEMENT ON VOTE AGAINST H.RES.883,"Washington, DC – Today, Congresswoman Julia Brownley (D-CA) joined Congressman Mike Ezell (R-MS) in introducing a resolution marking the 82nd anniversary of the establishment of the United States Naval Construction Force, more commonly known as the “Seabees.” The resolution recognizes the tremendous sacrifices and contributions of the Seabees, who have fought and served on behalf of our country. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Senator Roger Wicker (R-MS) introduced the companion legislation in the United States Senate.   “On the 82nd anniversary of the founding of the Navy Seabees, we acknowledge the thousands of service members – past and present – who have bravely defended our shores in every conflict since World War II. With a ‘Can Do’ motto, the Seabees carry out a mission to build bases, roadways, airstrips, and other essential infrastructure necessary for our military at home and around the world,” said Congresswoman Brownley. “As the proud representative of Naval Base Ventura County and home of the Pacific Seabees, I am honored to recognize and pay tribute to these remarkable sailors and their distinguished service to our country.” “For more than eight decades, the Seabees have served with honor, ingenuity, and a “Can Do” attitude,” said Congressman Ezell. “I am proud to have the Atlantic fleet Seabees call South Mississippi home, and I am incredibly grateful for their contributions to our nation and to our coastal communities.” “The remarkable history of the Seabees began right here in Rhode Island,” said Senator Whitehouse. “This resolution highlights the many contributions of the industrious Seabees in service to our country, and recognizes the role the Ocean State has played along the way.” “The Seabees are an integral part of Mississippi’s military history and Gulfport’s community. They have often put themselves into dire situations, whether assisting with natural disaster recovery or humanitarian missions across the globe. Our country and world are better off because of them,” said Senator Wicker. The resolution is also cosponsored by Representatives Seth Magaziner (D-RI), Gabe Amo (D-RI), Michael Guest (R-MS), Trent Kelly (R-MS), Nick Lalota (R-NY), Carlos A. Giménez (R-FL), Jill Tokuda (D-HI), Salud Carbajal (D-CA), Barbara Lee (D-CA), Mark Takano (D-CA), John Rutherford (R-FL), Adam Schiff (D-CA), and Bennie Thompson (D-MS), as well as Senators Jack Reed (D-RI) and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS).

April 19,Yvette D. Clarke,D,N.Y.-9,CLARKE VOTES TO CONDEMN IRANIAN ATTACK ON ISRAEL,"Subscribe to receive the latest news, insights, and updates directly to your inbox. WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Representative Kathy Castor (FL-14) and U.S. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (NV) introduced bicameral legislation to make it easier for new energy projects to connect to the U.S. electricity grid – in an effort to improve grid reliability and lower energy costs for families. “Across the United States, new energy projects are stalled, waiting in long lines to interconnect to the grid,” said Rep. Castor. “Our bill would make commonsense reforms to the outdated, sluggish interconnection process and enable new energy generation to come online, faster. More energy generation on the grid means lower prices for consumers and more reliability throughout the electricity system.”  “There are new energy projects being developed all over the country and we need to make sure they can get online as quickly as possible,” said Senator Cortez Masto. “By speeding up the slow and outdated process of connecting new projects to the grid, my bicameral legislation will lower energy costs for Nevada families and make our grids more reliable.” ""The ongoing transformation of our energy landscape, characterized by the rapid retirement of power plants, the emergence of new technologies, the electrification of various sectors, a resurgence in load growth unseen for decades, and increasingly frequent extreme weather events, underscores consumers' undeniable concerns regarding reliable and affordable electricity services,” said Karen Onaran, President and CEO of Electricity Consumers Resource Council. “It is essential that we rapidly connect replacement resources to an upgraded and modern electricity grid. The Expediting Generator Interconnection Procedures Act (EGIPA) proposes measures to further expedite and standardize the generator interconnection process, aiming for efficient and cost-effective solutions."" “Reducing barriers to all power plant development is a commonsense bipartisan imperative,” said Devin Hartman of R Street Institute. “These barriers threaten grid reliability in an era of resurgent growth in demand. Fortunately, the Expediting Generator Interconnection Procedures Act (EGIPA) would ensure FERC finishes the job. It would bolster grid reliability, lower energy costs, and improve environmental outcomes by reducing regulatory impediments and facilitating freer markets. EGIPA is simply sound public policy.” The process of connecting new power plants to the national power grid – called interconnection – is complicated, expensive, and can take years to complete. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, the “high volume of projects and inadequate existing procedures for interconnection has led to uncertainties, delays, inequities, and added costs for developers, consumers, utilities, and their regulators.” a recent study from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory finds that interconnection backlog is only getting worse. Rep. Castor’s Expediting Generator Interconnection Procedures Act (EGIPA) would require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to make low-hanging fruit reforms to the interconnection process, making it faster and easier to complete. For example, the bill would promote the use of automation and standardized study criteria to help expedite interconnection studies.  Ultimately, this legislation aims to improve grid reliability and lower prices for consumers by making more energy options available. It should be a key element of any permitting reform package that Congress moves forward with this year.  EGIPA is supported by a diverse group of 20 different organizations, including energy consumer advocacy groups like Electricity Consumers Resource Council (ELCON), Electricity Customer Alliance, and Industrial Energy Consumers of America (IECA)."
April 19,Robert E. Latta,R,Ohio-5,Latta's Op-Ed: Baseload Capacity is Key to American Energy Success,"WASHINGTON- Today, Congressman David Scott (GA-13), Ranking Member of the House Agriculture Committee, sent a letter urging Governor Brian Kemp to take executive action to curb the production and possession of un-serialized and untraceable weapons commonly known as “ghost guns.” “Our communities are facing a scourge of violence because of homemade weapons that can be purchased and manufactured using the internet,” said Congressman David Scott. “Georgia’s lack of state statutes against these guns has caused them to permeate the streets, wreaking havoc in our communities. That is why I am calling on Governor Kemp to uphold his responsibility as our state’s chief law enforcement officer and use his authority to regulate ‘ghost guns’ and save lives.”  Ghost guns are often purchased online through pre-made gun kits complete with instructions. Once assembled, these firearms do not contain serial numbers, making them untraceable and especially dangerous in the hands of criminal actors. Also of concern is 3-D printed gun parts which can increase the fire rate and lethality of previously unmodified weapons. The accessibility and untraceable nature of ghost guns is highly concerning, as they remove barriers for individuals who would otherwise be denied access to firearms. The letter has been endorsed by BlackPush, an Atlanta-based advocacy group dedicated to preventing gun violence and ending social injustice. ""With the rocketing rates of gun violence facing our nation, we must do more to limit access to guns by those seeking to do harm,” said BlackPush President and Founder Shaun Smith. “In Georgia, recent tragedies have underscored the negative impact that guns can have on our society and our communities while shattering the lives of those impacted. We echo Congressman Scott’s call to regulate ‘ghost guns’ and we further call on the State of Georgia to look at passing red flag laws, expanding background checks, and investing in mental health treatment.""

Smith,R,N.J.-4,"<span class=""kicker"">Concerns mount over Verizons planned 5G towers in Belmar </span>Smith introduces legislation to empower local residents concerned by the proliferation of 5G towers","April 18, 2024 Letter to Ways and Means Committee Emphasizes Support for HOPE/HELP Text of Letter (PDF) WASHINGTON – Haiti Caucus Co-Chairs Congresswomen Ayanna Pressley (MA-07), Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick (D-FL), and Yvette D. Clarke (D-NY) led a letter to House Ways and Means Committee leadership emphasizing support for the early renewal of the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement (HOPE) and the Haiti Economic Lift Program (HELP) Acts, commonly known as HOPE/HELP. The HOPE/HELP program allows duty-free access for certain apparel and textile products from Haiti to the U.S. market. “Now more than ever is the time to help stabilize Haiti and save lives – that includes supporting its economic growth and critical trade sectors,” said Congresswoman Pressley. “The Haitian people have suffered deeply and to allow HOPE/HELP to expire would be a drastic disservice to their livelihood. I am proud to join my fellow co-chairs in calling for the reauthorization of these vital programs and preserving our longstanding trade partnership with our Haitian neighbors.” “HOPE/HELP plays a critical role in driving economic expansion in Haiti’s garment industry and fostering employment in the country,” said Congresswoman Cherfilus-McCormick. “In these uncertain times for Haiti, it is imperative that we uphold and continue this vital program to ensure Haiti’s continued economic progress and stability.” “With the ongoing security crisis confronting Haiti, it is critical Haiti’s economy has the support needed to endure this challenging period in its history. Make no mistake – the swift renewal of HOPE/HELP is essential for Haiti’s post-crisis recovery and the future of its communities,” said Congresswoman Clarke. “Allowing Haiti’s apparel industry to lose necessary support in this moment of uncertainty would only serve to pull the rug out from under Haiti’s economy and instill further hardship on a nation that has already suffered dearly. Haiti and its people remain cherished allies of the United States, and that is why I am proud to stand with my fellow Co-Chairs of the Haiti Caucus to call for the continued funding of these vital programs.” HOPE/HELP is due to expire in September 2025, a little over a year from now.  As a result of these programs, apparel exports have grown to over $1 billion, representing over 80% of Haiti’s total exports. While the security crisis has justifiably received the most attention, the House Haiti Caucus recognizes the essential importance of maintaining Haiti’s formal economy.  Immediate reauthorization of HOPE/HELP ranks as one of the top policy priorities that the United States can do to help Haiti at this moment in time.  Additional signatories of the letter include Reps. Alma Adams (D-NC), Mario Diaz-Balart (R-FL), Gerald Connolly (D-VA), Adriano Espaillat (D-NY), Maxwell Alejandro Frost (D-FL), Dan Goldman (D-NY), Jonathan Jackson (D-IL), Sydney Kamlager-Dove (D-CA), Barbara Lee (D-CA), Michael Lawler (R-NY), Andre Carson (D-IN). A copy of the letter text can be found here. As Representative for the Massachusetts 7th Congressional District, Congresswoman Pressley serves as Co-Chair for the House Haiti Caucus and represents one of the largest Haitian diaspora communities in the country, with approximately 46,000 Haitians and Haitian-Americans living across the state and over half in the Boston metropolitan area. Additionally, Massachusetts is home to more than 4,700 Haitians with Temporary Protected Status. ### Washington DC Office 402 Cannon HOB

April 19,Kevin McCarthy,R,Calif.-20,Speaker Johnson on House National Security Supplemental: A Lot More Oversight and Accountability,"This month, I introduced new legislation to increase opportunities for minority entrepreneurs to own broadcast stations in our communities. The Broadcast Varied Ownership Incentives for Community Expanded Service, or Broadcast VOICES Act, restores a program once proven effective and is very much needed today. The legislation will increase diversity among owners in the broadcasting industry by restoring mechanisms that encourage investment in broadcast stations owned by minorities and women. And I’m pleased to have Senator Gary Peters from Michigan introduce a Senate version of the bill. Our media landscape must reflect the diversity of the communities they serve. The Broadcast VOICES Act will re-open doors that have been shut for too long, giving more women and people of color in Nevada and around the country the chance to lead. I’m proud of our work empowering underrepresented voices to tell their stories and shape our local and national discourse. The Nevada Broadcasters Association supports the Broadcast VOICES Act. Their President and CEO, Mitch Fox, stated, “We believe this bill will encourage broadcast ownership diversity.” The Broadcast VOICES Act would reinstate the Minority Tax Certificate Program, significantly increasing minority ownership in broadcast media from 1978 to 1995. The program enabled the issuance of 287 radio and 40 television station certificates, increasing minority and women-owned station ownership by over 550%. Despite its success, the program was repealed in 1995. As of 2021, less than 6% of commercial broadcast television stations were owned by women and less than 4% are minority-owned. Under this legislation, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) would once again issue these tax certificates to facilitate sales of broadcast stations to socially disadvantaged individuals. It would also mandate annual FCC reports to Congress to recommend further ways to enhance ownership diversity. Additionally, the act introduces a new tax credit for current broadcast owners who donate their stations to train individuals new to managing and operating broadcast stations. This credit aims to rectify past imbalances and ensure continued support and growth for the next generation of the media profession. I am proud to have the support of the National Urban League, the National Association of Broadcasters, the National Association of Black Owned Broadcasters, the Asian Americans Advancing Justice (AAJC), the Hispanic Federation, the League of United Latin American Citizens, and the Multicultural Media, Telecom & Internet Council behind the Broadcast VOICES Act."

Kathy Castor (FL-14) released the below statement on Governor Ron DeSantis violating the law and disenrolling 22,576 Florida children from KidCare: “Governor DeSantis is throwing Florida kids off of the children’s health care program (“CHIP” or “Kidcare” in Florida) and erecting barriers that keep kids from the doctor’s office in violation of federal law. On January 1, 2024, a new federal protection for children went into effect nationwide: continuous eligibility for Medicaid and CHIP coverage for children for 12 months. This means that once children are determined eligible for Medicaid or CHIP anywhere across the nation, they keep their health coverage for an entire year. It is a vital reform that is being celebrated across America – except by Florida’s governor. “Congress enacted the 12-month continuous eligibility reform to help families cut costs, ensure that children do not experience a harmful gap in health coverage, and to cut time-consuming bureaucratic red tape. As we have seen during the Medicaid “unwinding” in Florida, children often lose their health coverage for procedural reasons, not because they are no longer eligible. Through the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023, Congress acted to protect children’s access to care, which has long-term health and financial benefits for families and for states. “Yet, Governor DeSantis does not seem to care about violating the law or taking care of Florida’s kids. His Administration has disenrolled 22,576 children from KidCare since January 1, 2024, for failing to pay premiums despite explicit instructions to the contrary. Florida is the only state in the country that is brazenly disregarding the new federal protection for children. I have been contacted by parents whose sick children have been dropped from KidCare and can’t receive the timely health services they need. This should not be happening. “At the same time, the State of Florida is suing the Biden administration to overturn this 12-month protection for children nationwide, simply because they don’t want to follow the law. This has led to a delay in the expansion of KidCare to children up to 300% of the federal poverty threshold, which is estimated to provide coverage to an additional 165,000 Florida children in five years. “The Governor and his administration are trying to twist the narrative but don’t believe them: they are violating the law and harming children and families.”"
April 19,Nanette Barragán,D,Calif.-44,In the Spotlight: Nanette Barragan,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Representative Pramila Jayapal (WA-07) released the following statement on her “no” vote on H.Res 1143: “Iran’s attack on Israel was a dangerous escalation in what could quickly turn into a larger regional war. I condemned the attack by Iran, as well as the precipitating hostilities that led to the attack, and I called for immediate de-escalation to reduce the threat of these actions widening into a larger regional conflict. I also supported President Biden’s actions, along with allies, in thwarting the Iranian attack and defending Israel against those threats.  “I voted no on this resolution because I am concerned that it further escalates the situation at exactly the time that we need to do the opposite. It does not mention the precipitating strike on the Iranian embassy by Israel that led to this attack. It ‘fully supports’ further offensive action by Israel and calls for continued arms sales to Israel. It makes no distinction between aid to Israel for defensive purposes—such as the Iron Dome funding or against threats from Hezbollah and Iran—versus aid to Israel for offensive strikes against innocent civilians in Gaza. While I continue to support defensive aid to Israel, I have been clear that I cannot support offensive military aid to Israel with no strings attached while the Netanyahu government continues to kill innocent civilians in Gaza — both through military action and the blocking of humanitarian aid leading to famine. “This is a time to de-escalate the conflict, not promote retaliatory violence, and I appreciate President Biden’s leadership on this issue. It is also of the utmost importance to achieve an immediate ceasefire to end the killing of innocents, return the hostages, and create a path for peace and security in the region. That is where our focus must be in this moment.”

April 19,Blaine Luetkemeyer,R,Mo.-3,Blaines Bulletin A Refusal To Lead Has Emboldened Our Adversaries,"Washington, DC—April 18, 2024…In response to Iran’s unprovoked attack on Israel last weekend, House Republicans passed a slew of legislation to deter further aggression from Iran and support our ally, Israel. Congressman Steve Womack (AR-3) supported every bill and is a cosponsor of two of them: H.R. 5947, To provide for the rescission of certain waivers and licenses relating to Iran, which passed the House of Representatives yesterday, and H. Res. 1143, Condemning Iran’s unprecedented drone and missile attack on Israel, which passed today.   Congressman Womack said, “Iran, the leading state sponsor of terror and brazen human rights abuser, hasn’t changed their ultimate goal – destroying the State of Israel. House Republicans have stepped up where the Biden Administration has fallen short. Advancing legislation this week to deter further aggression from Iran is our strategic and moral obligation to our friend and ally. The United States must continue to stand in unwavering support of Israel in their fight to protect their people and rid the world of evil terrorists.”   Bill breakdowns:  "
April 19,Morgan Griffith,R,Va.-9,Congressman Griffiths Weekly E-Newsletter 4.19.24,"Congressman Blaine Luetkemeyer (MO-03) introduced the Regulatory Transparency for Small Businesses Act. The bill forces federal agencies, when proposing a regulation, to identify an approximate number of small entities that will be affected by the regulation, NAICS Codes for those industries, and a cost per small entity. The agency must also provide the data used to make that determination.  “On top of record inflation, workforce shortages and more, overregulation is costing our small business communities hundreds of thousands every year. As of 2021, the Biden Administration has issued 817 final rules costing $482.7 billion, resulting in 292.7 million hours of paperwork.” Said Congressman Luetkemeyer.” Part of the problem is that agencies are not being transparent about the potential impact the rules they are passing will have. This lack of transparency has led to many overburdensome rules that have negatively impacted small businesses across the nation. This bill will deter more harmful rules from passing by ensuring that agencies include critical information about how rules will impact small businesses before they can move forward with the rulemaking process.   Background: According to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), if an agency believes a rule will have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small businesses, they must construct regulatory flexibility analyses addressing cost of compliance and significant alternatives considered, along with other applicable metrics. In contrast, if an agency determines that a rule will not have such an impact, the head of the agency must “certify” that decision and is then free to continue with normal rulemaking procedures. Unfortunately, there is nothing in statue to define what criteria should be included when an agency certifies that a rule will not have a significant impact, leaving agencies free to unilaterally decide which rules are impactful to small businesses and which are not.  Because of this, many rules in violation of the RFA have been enacted without any changes. One of the more notorious cases includes the recent Supreme Court ruling of Waters of the United States (WOTUS). Because agency heads erroneously certified that WOTUS would not significantly impact small businesses, the rulemaking process was finalized with essentially no changes.   The Regulatory Transparency for Small Businesses Act ensures agencies are no longer overlooking these critical preliminary measures when they certify and forces agencies to be transparent about their calculations.

April 18,Kevin McCarthy,R,Calif.-20,Speaker Johnson on House National Security Supplemental: A Lot More Oversight and Accountability,"For Immediate Release Contact: Taylor Haulsee Speaker Johnson joined Fox Business and CNN to discuss the House’s supplemental national security legislation     WASHINGTON — This afternoon, after announcing the House’s national security supplemental plan, Speaker Johnson joined Larry Kudlow on Fox Business’ Kudlow and Jake Tapper on CNN’s The Lead to discuss the House plan, the need for urgent border security measures, and the motion to vacate.   “What we’ve done is taken the Senate supplemental bill, and we’ve improved the process and the policy, and that’s a really important thing,” Speaker Johnson said.   Click here to watch Kudlow, here for The Lead   On the supplemental national security package:   What we’ve done is we’ve taken the senate supplemental bill, and we’ve improved the process and the policy, and that’s a really important thing. What we’ve done for example, in the Ukraine piece of this, is we’ve added the loan instrument concept, we’ve added the REPO Act – which everybody knows is the seizure of corrupt Russian oligarchs’ assets – to be used to fund the effort in Ukraine. We introduced a lot of new accountabilities and oversight. The Congress has a responsibility to do and the strategy shift as well. We’re going to require within 45 days, the White House to deliver to Congress a meaningful plan. What is the endgame here? What’s the objective and how are we going to accomplish this and bring this conflict to an end?   By the way Larry, on Ukraine, 80% of what we’ll spend here goes to America’s industrial defense base, and that’s a replenishment of our stocks and weapons. And I think that’s a really important point. We’re also adding sanctions against Russia and Iran and all our adversaries including China, and that’s a really important thing as well.   So, the House will do its will and have a rigorous amendment process to the underlying legislation.   On the urgent need to support U.S. allies:   You got to be tough on your adversaries. The problem is you and I both know, Larry, this President is projecting weakness on the world stage and that’s why all our nation’s enemies are acting so provocatively. On the Israel example, I mean, President Biden and Chuck Schumer had been criticizing Israel and appeasing Iran, that strategy should be exactly the opposite. We should be helping Israel and they’ve been turning their backs on them.   And then of course, this encourages Xi and encourages China, when they see that we’re not going to stand strong and we’re not going to put the flag in the ground so to speak and hold the line. They’re going to act, they’re going to move, and we’re concerned about what China may do in Taiwan. We talk about it all the time. We’re certainly concerned about Iran’s open aggression now against Israel, our dear friend and ally. And Russia, of course, is still on the march in Ukraine. We must stand strong. A strong America is good for the entire world. We bring stability and peace – the perception that America is strong is important and has been since World War II and we cannot let down that responsibility.   On border security:   Some of my colleagues want the Speaker of the House to have a magic wand. If we could close the border ourselves, we would have done it a long time ago. We passed HR 2 over a year ago, it’s sitting on Chuck Schumer’s desk. That had all the components. It closes the border, changes asylum processes and problems, ends catch and release and in reinstates remain in Mexico. All the things that President Trump had done so effectively, Biden reflexively did the opposite. And that’s been the problem.   We pass resolutions, we pass the laws, they sit on Chuck Schumer’s desk in the Senate because again, the Democrats run the Senate, the Democrats run the White House, and they want an open border. That voter ID, the idea that you would have to prove that you’re a US citizen to vote in a US election, a federal election, is critically important. We’re going to move that in the days ahead as well. That’s what we were talking about at Mar a Lago at the press conference.   But the American people demand this, they deserve it. We know the border is a catastrophe. And the reason that we’re bringing to the floor this week, the End the Border Catastrophe Act, is because it’s aptly named. And it describes what is on the hearts and minds of every single American. It doesn’t matter where you live. I’ve been in 23 states in the last seven or eight weeks Larry traveling around the country. It doesn’t matter whether I’m out west, upstate New York, deep south, Midwest, it’s all the same. Everybody knows, this is what we must do. If you don’t have a secure border, you don’t have sovereignty; you don’t have security. You don’t even really have a nation. And that’s what Joe Biden has put at risk. And that’s why we had to impeach Mayorkas.   On President Biden’s weakness:   I think this sets up the next election, the next administration, the next president, and I believe [Trump is] going to win – in a better position. I think that President Trump is strong enough that he could enter the world stage and broker a peace deal in Ukraine, if Russia is still advancing at that time. I mean, I think he has the strong enough hand to be able to do that. And that’s why this election is so important. There’s a very stark contrast – you know we didn’t have all these global conflicts. We didn’t have hot wars around the globe when Donald Trump was the president. You know why? Because our adversaries feared him and respected. They don’t fear and respect Joseph Biden. And that’s a real problem for all of us.   On the motion to vacate:   I’m not asking the Democrats to get involved in that I believe the house will do as well. Look, I’m trying to govern and lead this institution at a very interesting, unprecedented time. We have challenges right now that no previous generation has faced. Newt Gingrich posted a few days ago on social media. The speaker’s job is effectively impossible. Now he said that I’m doing the hardest job that maybe it has ever been in the history of the U.S. House. Maybe, he said, arguably since the Civil War. Why because we live in a very divided time and very divisive politics in the age of social media. 24-hour news cycle, where everybody can express their opinions every moment of the day but things they’re disgruntled about. It makes a lot of challenges, but we’re going to get through this. Listen, we are the greatest nation in the history of the world. Okay, we are going to show that we’re going to keep the train on the tracks and not get derailed and get involved in all of this. It’s such a dangerous time on the world stage and that look, I don’t walk around thinking about the motion to vacate. It’s a procedural matter here that I think it’s been abused in recent times. Maybe at some point we change. Right now, I’ve got to do my job. And so do all my colleagues. And I’m confident at the end of the day, in spite of all the drama, and all the palace intrigue, I think we’re gonna get that done.   ###

April 19,Kevin McCarthy,R,Calif.-20,Speaker Johnson: “A Strong America is Good for the Entire World”,"Washington, DC—April 17, 2024…Today, Congressman Steve Womack (AR-3) joined a bipartisan, bicameral group of 22 Members of Congress in sending a letter to United States Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, decrying the United States Postal Service’s (USPS) recent nationwide consolidation and review announcements that could severely diminish mail service reliability for postal networks across the country, including in Arkansas.    “A common theme of these announcements is the so-called ‘modernization’ of Processing and Distribution Centers (P&DCs) into Local Processing Centers (LPCs),” the Members wrote. “Taken together, these proposals dismantle parts of the Postal Service’s robust network that helps distribute mail across the country and places outgoing sorting into more distant facilities.  The result of this change is that mail will need to travel farther from its origin to its sorting, creating inefficiencies in the system, especially for local mail.”   “These consolidation proposals never have had any discernible support from local communities.  On the contrary, we have heard strong opposition to these efforts from USPS customers, community leaders, local businesses, and postal employees,” the Members continued. “Rather than marching forward with these plans and offering short and vague statements dismissing concerns, the Postal Service should be communicating why the organization believes these changes are beneficial and what the specific impact of the changes will be to mail service.”   “The Postal Service provides an essential service upon which our constituents rely.  The robust nature of the Postal Service’s current network is its strength, not its weakness.  To ensure that our constituents continue to receive reliable service, we urge you to reconsider these consolidation announcements,” the Members concluded.   The announced network changes align with the Postal Service’s Delivering for America (DFA) plan. However, a recent review by the USPS Office of Inspector General for the implementation of the new Regional Processing and Distribution Center (RP&DC) in Richmond, Virginia, highlighted the problems with the USPS’s plan.  That facility was the first to be converted to an RP&DC as a result of the DFA plan.  The Inspector General’s review noted that challenges associated with changes to the facility “contributed to a decrease in service performance for the Richmond region that continued four months after launch.”      The letter can be read in full here.   Congressman Womack initially expressed his concern for the consolidations and operational changes when USPS announced in November the Mail Processing Facility Review being conducted by USPS with respect to the NW Arkansas P&DC in Fayetteville, Arkansas.

April 18,Julia Brownley,D,Calif.-26,"Brownley, Ezell, Whitehouse, and Wicker Lead Bipartisan, Bicameral Resolution Recognizing the United States Navy Seabees","Keynote Speech at National Consumer Law Center Spring Training Event Delivered Remotely
Friday, April 12 at 4 PM at Omni Hotel at Centennial Park  Hello everyone, thank you for having me here this afternoon.  It is my honor to have been invited to deliver the keynote address to this, the Spring Training Event of the National Association of Consumer Advocates, a group that I deeply respect and whose work I greatly admire.  I want to thank you for your tireless efforts protecting the rights and interests of everyday people, workers, and consumers. For decades the pendulum has been stuck on the side of the powerful, the wealthy, and the greedy. So the rich have gotten richer, the middle class has shrunk, the poor are getting poorer, and the courthouse doors have gotten heavier and heavier to open for those seeking to hold the corporate and business interests accountable for the harms they do to the so called ""little guys"" of our nation.  
 
And I want to thank particularly your Georgia members, who represent consumers when they get mistreated, cheated and/or ripped off by bad actors in the commercial sector. When your members are seeking relief for the consumers they represent, they are more and more met with the barrier posed by forced arbitration clauses imbedded in take it or leave it contracts, or terms of service agreements. 
 
Using consumer protection statutes as the shield to protect your clients, your members empower consumers to stand up for their legal rights despite the deck being stacked against them.  
 
Legislatively nullifying and banning pre-dispute forced arbitration clauses in consumer and employment agreements has been a cause that I took on shortly after being sworn in as a member of Congress, almost 18 years ago. I cant believe that it’s been 18 years! It’s been a long slog to make change, but we have seen the Forced Arbitration Injustice Repeal Act pass out of the House and on to the Senate the past two sessions of Congress. There is still much work to be done to get the FAIR Act passed in the House AND Senate, then signed into law by the President. The task is daunting, but we are making progress and as long as I am a member of Congress I will never give up on passing the FAIR Act into law.  I hung a shingle and practiced law for 27 years before being elected to Congress. During those 27 years, I also served for 12 years as a Magistrate Court Judge presiding over small claims court cases, among other responsibilities. During all those years, handling so many cases -- only once did I encounter the barrier of forced arbitration. It was about three months before I shut the doors to my law practice at the end of 2006. A friend brought in a case against her seeking the confirmation of an arbitration award in a debt collection case. One of my last acts as an attorney was to work out a payment plan after having determined that my client was bound to the arbitration award due to the consumer agreement that she had signed.  The next time I encountered forced arbitration was a year or two later, when my wife and I were thinking about downsizing and we were looking at building a townhome. In reviewing the documents, I came across a clause that required us to waive our rights to file a lawsuit in court in the event of the builder’s default under the terms of the contract. The contract mandated that any dispute with the builder/developer would have to be adjudicated via arbitration. I don't remember the fine details in the contract about the selection of the arbitrator, the venue of the proceeding, who pays the costs, etc., but I do recall walking away from the deal with a bad feeling about the developer and how unfair the deal was, after they refused to cross out the arbitration clause in the agreement.  Since then, I have witnessed the explosion in the use of forced arbitration clauses in just about every transaction in which a little guy engages, in the process of living a regular life during these rapidly changing times in which we live. 
 
Forced arbitration is a trick used by the powerful to prevent the less powerful from suing them in court in front of a jury of their peers. From terms-of-use agreements with cell phone service providers and social media companies to opening a bank account,  purchasing or leasing a car, to agreements needing to be signed to place our loved ones in a nursing home -- one can expect to be forced to sign or acknowledge that they are waiving their right to go to court in the event of a dispute, and agree to be bound by the arbitration process. Its a take-it-or-leave-it situation, and the consumer is forced to waive their rights if they want a cell phone, because you cant find a provider that offers service that doesn't require forced arbitration.  So how did we get to this point where if you want a job, or to purchase just about every good or service in America, you are required to sign away your 7th Amendment right to a trial by jury in a court of law? The floodgates for forced arbitration were opened wide by our very own Federalist Society stacked federal and state judiciaries, led by an activist Supreme Court of the United States. That's why I have filed legislation that unpacks the Supreme Court by adding four justices, legislation that would impose 18-year term limits on Supreme Court justices, legislation adding 77 new federal district court judgeships, and in the last Congress and in the next session of Congress, I will introduce legislation to increase the number of judgeships on the nation’s federal courts of appeals. In the 1995 case of Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v Dobson (513 U.S. 283), Justice (Sandra Day) O’Connor wrote: “over the past decade the Supreme Court has abandoned all pretense of ascertaining congressional intent with respect to the Federal Arbitration Act, building instead, case by case, and edifice of its own creation.” Justice O’Connor was spot on with her analysis. Starting in the 1980’s, the Supreme Court began transforming the Federal Arbitration Act into something never intended by Congress, which passed the Act in 1925 to provide an alternative by which businesses of equal standing and power could resolve disputes without protracted litigation in court.  Under current Supreme Court law, arbitration can be forced upon the much less powerful consumer by the wealthy and powerful corporation, by way of a take-it-or-leave it contract. And I don't have to tell you all of the disadvantage the consumer faces when forced into arbitration when a dispute arises. Nor must I convince you that the threat of a jury trial levels the playing field for the consumer against the wealthy and powerful business against whom the dispute arose.  Passage of the FAIR Act would render unenforceable forced arbitration clauses in in consumer agreements. The legislation currently has 100 cosponsors, and when Democrats controlled the House we passed the FAIR Act 225 to 186 in the 116th Congress, and 222 to 209 in the 117th Congress.  Momentum will continue to build towards passage, and I'm grateful to see the progress that has been made. But clearly, we still have a lot of work to do. The good news is that I ain't no ways tired!  With your support, we will continue the battle to protect consumers, and we will continue to fight until we win. You have my full support as you battle in the trenches for your client, and please know that you will always have an advocate in congress working with you to protect our clients! Thank you, and have a great training event!

April 18,Kathy Castor,D,Fla.-14,"Rep. Castor, Sen. Cortez Masto Introduce Legislation to Lower Energy Costs, Improve Electricity Grid Reliability","April 17, 2024 “We now find ourselves at a critical inflection point: we can either leverage diplomacy to de-escalate tensions and push for peace, or we can stand idly by as this spirals into a broader regional conflict that will result in more loss of life…” “Make no mistake: history will remember this moment as a genocide.” Video (YouTube) WASHINGTON – Today, in a floor speech on the House floor, Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) called for urgent de-escalation in the Middle East and renewed her calls for a ceasefire in Gaza to prevent a broader regional war. The Congresswoman’s remarks come at a time of rising tensions in the Middle East, following the Iranian military’s attack on Israel as well as the Israeli military’s attack on the Iranian consulate in Syria. Since the horrific October 7th attack, Congresswoman Pressley has consistently and stridently called for a ceasefire to save lives, return all hostages, and surge humanitarian aid to Gaza. To date, nearly 34,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli airstrikes and over 100 hostages are still held captive by Hamas in Gaza. A transcript of the Congresswoman’s remarks is available below and the full video is available here. Transcript: In Floor Speech, Pressley Urges De-Escalation in Middle East, Renews Call for CeasefireU.S. House of RepresentativesApril 17, 2024 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention to the massacre of the Palestinian people and the urgent need to de-escalate the Middle East. For months now, after the brutal attack on October 7th, the world has watched in horror as the crisis in Gaza has worsened daily. Today, less than two hundred days later, nearly 34,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces. Every day that goes by without a ceasefire is another day that Palestinians are subjected to violence, starvation, death, and destruction. And every day that we do not de-escalate the region, more lives are put at risk. Mr. Speaker, I condemn the Iranian military’s attack on Israel and I condemn the Israeli military’s attack on the Iranian consulate in Syria.  These escalations are dangerous. And we now find ourselves at a critical inflection point. We can either leverage diplomacy to de-escalate tensions and push for peace, or we can stand idly by as this spirals into a broader regional conflict that will result in more loss of life – Palestinian, Israeli, and American. We must de-escalate. And facilitating a lasting ceasefire in the region is the only path forward. Some of my colleagues seem all too willing to rush into an endless war with Iran and continue providing a blank check to the Israeli military. Right now, Palestinians in Gaza are being starved, bombed, tortured and executed. Generations of Palestinian families have been wiped out. Over 2 million are displaced from homes that have been razed to the ground. Make no mistake: history will remember this moment as a genocide.  We cannot bomb our way to peace, and the U.S. must stop using our tax dollars to arm the Israeli military with more bombs and bullets. The same bombs and bullets that have been used to kill over 14,000 children in Gaza. Shameful. It’s why we see momentum across the globe in support of a ceasefire.  Millions are marching peacefully in the streets.  A ceasefire is the mandate. A ceasefire to surge humanitarian aid. A ceasefire to bring all the hostages home. A ceasefire to save lives. We will never be silent in the face of injustice.  Ceasefire now. ­— Throughout this conflict, Rep. Pressley has been a vocal and consistent advocate of diplomacy, de-escalation, and saving lives. ### Washington DC Office 402 Cannon HOB

April 18,David Scott,D,Ga.-13,Congressman David Scott Presses Governor Kemp to Take Immediate Action on Ghost Guns,"Fox News logo FIRST ON FOX: A Republican congressman has personally delivered a letter to Japan’s prime minister urging him to take action in order to address the issue of hundreds of American children being abducted and held in Japan by parents who took the children from the other parent without their consent. ""As our two countries continue to take steps to strengthen our democratic, economic and security ties, I would like to draw your attention to an open wound that threatens to derail many ongoing efforts,"" GOP Rep. Chris Smith wrote in a letter that he hand-delivered to Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. ""To date, more than 500 American children have been abducted to Japan by one of their respective parents and remain separated from their American parent. These abductions often occur against pre-existing court orders and, in some cases, with the passport assistance of the Japanese government."" Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, left, and Rep. Chris Smith. ( ) ""For the sake of the children who are suffering, and for the sake of U.S. and Japanese relations, I seek your public commitment to reunite these families,"" Smith wrote in the letter. ""I respectfully request that you work with the United States to create a process by which families can be reunited and heal."" Smith points out in his letter that the House of Representatives passed H. Res. 1326 in 2010 calling on Japan to ""address the urgent problem of abduction to and retention of United States citizen children"" and in 2014, the Sean and David Goldman International Child Abduction Prevention and Return Act was signed into law to ""prevent the terrible crime of international parental child abduction and empower the U.S. executive branch with tools to address this problem bilaterally with countries of particular concern."" ""Regrettably, the abduction of American children to your country remains an ongoing human rights crisis that cannot be sidelined or overlooked,"" Smith wrote. ""When a country such as Japan has failed to resolve 30 percent of abduction cases that have been pending more than 12 months, U.S. law requires the Secretary of State to take action."" Smith wrote that the Goldman Act has helped return U.S. citizen children from other countries but ""Japan has not assisted in any notable returns."" Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida speaks during a news conference in the Rose Garden of the White House on April 10, 2024. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File) Smith wrote in his letter that the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children has found that abduction victims are often taught by their kidnapper that the left-behind parent ""doesn't want them"" or that the left-behind parent is ""dangerous,"" ""harmful,"" ""dead"" or ""unknown."" ""This trauma is not easily erased,"" Smith wrote. Unlike many other countries, Japan does not allow dual custody of children for their divorced parents. Only one parent can take the children, though the other parent can gain visitation rights. In some cases, the parent with custody blocks contact with the other one. There have been some high-profile cases of custody disputes brought up by foreign husbands divorced from Japanese women accusing them of child abduction. ""Your Excellency, it is my sincere hope that these Japanese American children will become a source of strength between our two countries rather than a reminder of an ongoing injustice and a barrier to a robust United States-Japan relationship,"" Smith concluded in his letter.  ""I respectfully request that you work with the United States to create a process by which families can be reunited and heal."" President Biden, left, and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida toast during an official State Dinner at the White House in Washington, D.C., April 10, 2024. (REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein) In a statement to Fox News Digital, Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, ""Since the Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (the so-called ""Hague Convention"") entered into force in Japan in 2014, Japan has been taking appropriate measures to deal with cases covered by the Hague Convention through cooperation with each contracting state based on the Convention."" ""Regarding cross-border child abduction cases between Japan and the U.S., the relevant authorities in both countries cooperate to appropriately respond to such cases."" The statement continued, ""The Government of Japan has explained the position of the Government of Japan, including the above points, to relevant U.S. officials, including Congressman Smith.""

It's a world-class destination for all who love to bike, rock climb, hunt, fish, hike, and more. Outdoor recreation is more than just a pastime here; it's part of our heritage. As an Arkansan, my profound love for our lands and outdoor recreation has been foundational in my role as Chairman of the Natural Resources Committee.  As Chairman, I am privileged to champion forward-thinking legislation, such as the Expanding Public Lands Outdoor Recreation Experiences Act, also known as the EXPLORE Act. This bill is a product of months of collaboration with folks on both sides of the aisle, united in our goal to make outdoor recreation more accessible nationwide.  The EXPLORE Act will modernize visitor experiences at parks, increase accessibility for veterans and service members outdoors, create new opportunities and trails for outdoorsmen and women to recreate, and support local communities that depend on access to our public lands. The bill also includes key priorities for Arkansans, like reopening overnight camping at Albert Pike Recreation Area, protecting battlefields, and creating more parking and restroom facilities at some of our favorite sites.  I believe that our lands should be enjoyed by all, and that's why I'm proud that the U.S. House of Representatives passed the EXPLORE Act this week with overwhelming bipartisan support. The passage of this landmark legislation is a testament to the future of outdoor recreation and conservation in our nation. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the upper chamber to pass EXPLORE in the Senate and swiftly send it to the President’s desk.  "

April 16,Sanford D. Bishop Jr.,D,Ga.-2,Congressman Bishop Announces 2024 Congressional Art Competition Winners,"Ventura, CA – On Wednesday, April 3, Congresswoman Julia Brownley (D-CA) presented $963,000 to the County of Ventura to upgrade the region’s 15-year-old analog simulcast radio communications system. The funds will go toward establishing a state-of-the-art digital radio communication system which will utilize 700MHz frequencies. The upgraded radio system will be used by all public safety entities throughout the county to improve communications interoperability for public safety and first responder individuals as they respond to incidents and disasters. “The importance of ensuring our law enforcement and public safety entities in Ventura County have access to high-quality, reliable communications equipment cannot be overstated,” said Congresswoman Julia Brownley. “Not only will this state-of-the-art communication system facilitate better communication and coordination between agencies, but all of our cities and residents will benefit from streamlined services that will lower costs and redundancies. This is truly a win-win for everyone across the region. In advocating for this project, my motivation was to ensure that our renowned and sophisticated law enforcement, public safety professionals, and first responders have the renowned and sophisticated equipment they need to support their mission and their work.” Residents throughout Ventura County will benefit from the upgraded system as it will allow agencies at both the city and county level to access the latest communications technology and transform the current analog radio system to digital. As well, the new radio system includes substantial cost reductions to local agencies by preventing expensive and redundant investments in singular radio communications systems, providing centralized and more comprehensive support for the first responders radio system. “As a first responder, I can tell you every moment counts,” stated Ventura County Sheriff Jim Fryhoff. “These upgrades will improve communications interoperability across our first responder agencies and ultimately lead to faster and more comprehensive response to incidents in our community.” The regional system will broadcast from 19 towers across the county and communications from those on scene and enroute can be repeated. In the current state, radio traffic from cities can often not reach beyond their municipal borders, making it harder for them to coordinate mutual aid from outside agencies until they are within range. Additional advantages of the upgraded system include data and media transmission through cellular integration with other smart devices and connection with FirstNet for nationwide interoperability. “Our county has experienced a number of incidents that have demonstrated the importance of clear and timely communication across our public safety entities,” stated Ventura County Supervisor Janice Parvin, Vice Chair of the Board of Supervisors. “We are grateful for Congresswoman Brownley’s recognition of the importance of this project.”

April 12,Bruce Westerman,R,Ark.-4,Time to EXPLORE,"Rep. Chris Smith chairs a congressional hearing on Turkey’s shocking human rights abuses and aggressive transnational repression on Tuesday, April 16, 2024. Nadine Maenza, Enes Kanter Freedom, and Abdulhamit Bilici testify at Smith’s hearing.             Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ), Co-Chair of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, today chaired a congressional hearing exposing the shocking human rights abuses and aggressive transnational repression of the Government of Turkey under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.             “Since 2016, the government of Turkey has, according to the US Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, ‘arrested or imprisoned more than 95,000 citizens, and closed more than 1,500 nongovernmental organizations…primarily for alleged ties to the movement of cleric Fethullah Gulen,’” said Smith.             “This Commission—and the US Congress—considers itself a friend of the Turkish people,” Smith continued. “And when the Government of Turkey commits grave human rights violations against its own people, this friendship means that we stand with the people,” said Smith.             “We call on the government of Turkey to change its course of human rights abuses,” said Smith, who cited a host of shocking abuses of human rights by the Turkish government, including arbitrary killings, suspicious deaths of persons in custody, forced disappearances, torture, arbitrary arrest and continued detention of tens of thousands of persons, and severe restrictions on freedom of expression and press freedom.             Among the experts testifying at Smith’s hearing was Enes Kanter Freedom, a human rights activist and former professional basketball star who was fired by the NBA for protesting the horrific human rights violations of the Chinese Communist Party.             In his testimony, Freedom shared personal encounters with Turkey’s transnational repression after he began speaking out against human rights abuses committed by President Erdogan.             “The Turkish government asked the US government to extradite me, canceled my passport, put my name on an Interpol list, imprisoned my father, and set a $500,000 bounty on my head,” said Freedom. “In 9 years, I received 12 arrest warrants and countless death threats.”             “They tried to attack me in front of a mosque in Boston, run social media campaigns against me, and pressured American universities, NGOs, and political groups to cancel their events with me,” said Freedom, who recounted two instances in 2017 in Indonesia and Romania where local officials tried to kidnap and arrest him to send him back to Turkey.             Other experts testifying at Smith’s hearing included Abdulhamit Bilici, the former Editor in Chief of Zaman who shared his own experience as a victim of Turkey’s transnational repression, and Nadine Maenza, the President of IRF Secretariat and former Chair of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF).             “I personally experienced both national and transnational repression as a journalist,” said Bilici. “I was the editor in chief of Zaman daily, the largest newspaper in Turkey. The Erdogan government brutally raided my newspaper in March 2016, five months before the coup attempt, and they shut down the paper after the coup attempt together with 200 critical media outlets.”             “When Erdogan regime took over the paper, the first thing they did was to fire me and to appoint a pro-government editor who converted the newspaper into a regime mouthpiece in 24 hours,” Bilici continued. “Facing serious threats, I had to leave the country for my safety.”             Maenza spoke to Turkey’s severe violations of religious freedom, including its persecution of Christians: “The government refuses to grant legal personality to many religious communities and continues to block the reopening of the Greek Orthodox Halki seminary. Many religious and ethnic minorities face harassment and discrimination, including Alevis, the largest religious minority in the country. Their houses of worship are not recognized by the government and are subjected to vandalism and attacks.”             “Turkey continues to criminalize blasphemy under article 216(3) of the Penal code,” Maenza added. “This is generally politically motivated against those accused of insulting or mocking Islam and to intimidate or retaliate against critics of President Erdogan.”             Smith, who meets regularly with people persecuted by foreign governments that target and pursue them inside the United States, urged his colleagues to support his Transnational Repression Policy Act (HR 3654) in response to the Biden Administration’s weak response to foreign governments’ attempts to harm, intimidate, silence, abduct, or spy on members of diaspora and exile communities within the US and other countries. ### Chris has three offices dedicated to constituent services.

April 15,Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan,D,Northern Marianas Islands,Marianas Wagner-Peyser passes House,"            Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ), Chair of the House Global Human Rights Subcommittee, introduced legislation (HR 7891) this week aimed at ensuring that cobalt—a key natural resource used to power electric vehicles, solar panels and other “green” products—that is extracted or processed with the use of child or forced labor in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) does not enter the United States market.             China processes 90 percent of the world’s cobalt, most of which comes from China-owned mines in the DRC.             “The Communist Chinese government—which has gained almost full dominance of every single step of the cobalt supply chain—profits from child and forced labor used to extract cobalt in the Democratic Republic of Congo and power our so-called ‘green economy,’” said Rep. Chris Smith, who also serves as Chair of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China and Co-Chair of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission.             “The United States must stop aiding and abetting Communist China’s egregious exploitation of children—some as young as 6 years old—and start becoming less dependent on Xi Jinping’s brutal dictatorship,” said Smith, who also authored the China Trade Relations Act (HR 638), which would require China to stop its horrific human rights violations if it wishes to enjoy normal trade relations with the United States.             Specifically, Smith’s bill—the Stop China’s Exploitation of Congolese Children and Adult Forced Labor through Cobalt Mining Act—would require the US Forced Labor Enforcement Task Force to lead a comprehensive investigation into the use of forced labor in the cobalt mining industry of the DRC and develop a strategy to ensure that cobalt mined by forced labor does not enter the US market.             The bill text was crafted with key input from the House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rep. Jason Smith (R-MO), whose committee has jurisdiction over the legislation and is scheduled to mark it up on Wednesday, fast tracking it for a vote on the House Floor.             “America has long fought to end child and adult forced labor, yet the cobalt vital to the batteries in our technology is unethically mined with the use of forced labor under Chinese control,” said Rep. Jason Smith. “This legislation is a critical step to blocking material tainted by these inhumane labor practices from entering this country. I am thankful to Rep. Chris Smith for introducing this legislation to stop these dangerous practices.”             The legislation is drawn in part from insightful testimony provided at the congressional hearing chaired by Rep. Chris Smith in November that exposed the Chinese Communist Party’s egregious exploitation of Congolese children and forced laborers, who toil in hazardous conditions to extract cobalt from unsafe mines including artisanal mines in the DRC.             The hearing built on one that Rep. Chris Smith chaired last Congress that included testimony from Fr. Rigobert Minani Bihuzo, a Catholic priest from the DRC who has helped lead efforts to expose China’s horrific human rights abuses across the country. Fr. Bihuzo stated: “The number of artisanal and small-scale mining sites from the Ituri region to Lake Tanganyika is estimated to be 1,000 and the number of artisanal miners to be 200,000 people, among them thousands of children and pregnant women.”             Rep. Chris Smith said the artisanal mines “are often no more than narrow shafts dug into the ground, which is why children are recruited—and in many cases forced—to descend into them, using only their hands or rudimentary tools without any protective equipment, to extract cobalt and other minerals.”             “The biggest beneficiaries of this cobalt continue to remain silent and refuse to face this uncomfortable truth: from dirt to battery, from cobalt to cars, the entire system is fueled by violence, cruelty, and corruption,” Rep. Chris Smith said. ### Chris has three offices dedicated to constituent services. Check out the location nearest to you: 2373 Rayburn House Office Building

April 15,Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan,D,Northern Marianas Islands,Talking disabilities,"For Immediate Release April 14, 2024 Contact: Taylor Haulsee     WASHINGTON — Today, Speaker Johnson joined Fox News’ Sunday Morning Futures to discuss Iran’s attack on Israel, supplemental national security legislation, securing the border, preventing non-citizens from voting, and FISA. Below are key excerpts from the interview.  Click here to watch the full interview   On support for Israel:   Well, we’ve understood the urgency of this from the very beginning. I mean, a few days after I became speaker way back in October, we passed our Israel support package. It’s been sitting on Chuck Schumer’s desk ever since because we included a pay for as you remember. What a concept, we took from the IRS expansion slush fund to pay for the Israel priority. We tried it again, just about a month and a half ago, a clean Israel, that many Democrats 166, as I remember in the House, voted against.Why? Because President Joe Biden said that he would veto that. So, the House Republicans and the Republican Party understand the necessity of standing with Israel. We’re going to try again this week, and the details of that package are being put together. Right now, we’re looking at the options and all these supplemental issues.   … I do think that we showed resolve last night thankfully, many of us were concerned about that to stand with our ally Israel. It’s critically important to do that. We took down most of those drones and missiles, as you noted, and our other allies stepped up as well. What’s important right now is that we stand with Israel. We should not be dictating to them what their policy is; we certainly shouldn’t be doing what Chuck Schumer did, trying to suggest they should have new elections at this critical time. They’re fighting for their very existence, and it’s never been more important for us to be there with them. And we’re resolved to do that. I hope that continues.   On supplemental legislation:   I had a great visit with [Trump] at Mar-a-Lago on Friday, and he and I are 100% united on these big agenda items. And when you talk about aid to Ukraine, he’s introduced the loan lease concept, which is a really important one, I think has a lot of consensus as well as these other ideas – the REPO Act, which we’ve discussed, which is seizing the the assets of corrupt Russian oligarchs to help pay for this resistance. I think these are ideas that I think can get consensus, and that’s what we’ve been working through. We’ll send our package, we’ll put something together and send it to the Senate and get these obligations completed.   On securing the border:   What Marjorie fails to notice is that we have been fighting on the border. We fight on it every day. We passed our comprehensive border security package HR 2, at the very beginning of this Congress. It has been sitting on Chuck Schumer’s desk. We pass these acts out of the House, and they get stopped in the Senate. See this the open-border Democrats control the Senate and the White House, obviously. So we’ve not been able to have a lawmaking exercise to meet that critical objective, but we’re fighting every day. That’s why we’ve been demanding that President Biden use his executive authority to seal that border. President Trump reiterated that demand at our press conference together on Friday. We need the White House to step up.   On preventing non-citizens from voting:   Well, listen, some [democrats] have admitted to us even on record in Judiciary Committee hearings that they want illegals to vote, they’ve allowed it in some municipal elections. What Congress has control over is federal elections. We have to do every single thing we can to secure their elections are free and fair. And one thing we need to do and this is what we’re about to the House Republicans are about to enter legislation in the record that will ensure that no illegal can vote in a federal election. You have to prove you’re a citizen, instead of as the law currently states, just checking a box to say it.   On FISA:   Yeah, President [Trump] and I agree on the necessity of the uses of FISA. Remember that’s how we killed terrorists. That’s how we stopped her as plots and on US soil. That’s why we haven’t had had another 911 since that terrible tragedy. President Trump used it and he reauthorized it in 2018 for six years. And that’s why it’s up again. What we did was we changed the bill to fit his requirements and ours and that is that it would expire now, two years from now in the middle of his next administration. So he’s the one that gets to determine what’s working well, it’s a critical tool to stop terrorism. That the whole point of the law is that we surveil foreign persons foreign terrorist, but the reason the warrant requirement is not helpful. And the reason that people that we love and respect like Mike Pompeo and John Ratcliffe and, and Robert O’Brien and Devin Nunez, who’ve been in the intelligence community and are our guys, are conservatives who came off Judiciary Committee, a couple of them. They said you can’t put the warrant on this. Here’s what happens quick scenarios. This is important for people to understand, Maria.   If we’re surveilling a terrorist in the Middle East, and the terrorist sends an email to a guy named John Smith in any town USA, and the email says the components will be delivered to your house this afternoon for further assembly and delivery to the high school stadium during the game. I think every American would want the analyst who saw that email from that foreign terrorist to do a query of the other communications between those two persons. That is not unlawful and that must continue. If that analysts had to get a warrant before that, it would add a huge time delay; the courts are not set up to be able to to handle all that volume. And Americans may die. We want to look at those emails and find out my goodness, which high school stadium? What time? And is this a bomb? And what are the components? We have to continue that to save American lives. That’s what’s at stake. This is not this is not searches on American citizens. If they were going to search John Smith, they would have to go get a warrant to do anything else. But this is lawfully collected data under Section 702. And it must continue.   ###

April 15,Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan,D,Northern Marianas Islands,Art Competition deadline: Next Friday,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Congressman Neal Dunn, M.D. (Florida-02) and Congresswoman Angie Craig (Minnesota-02) introduced the Improving CARE for Youth Act. The bill allows for same-day billing for mental health services for youth Medicaid beneficiaries who are being seen for a primary care service. “Our youth’s mental health is worse than it’s ever been, especially following the destructive COVID-19 lockdowns. Protecting the future of the youth in our country is too important to be hindered by a Medicaid billing restriction,” said Congressman Dunn. “Fixing same-day billing for Medicaid beneficiaries may seem like a small change, but it will have a big impact. We must ensure all children have access to the quality care they need.” “We should be doing everything we can to make it easier for children to access the high-quality mental health care they deserve. That’s why I introduced this bipartisan bill with my colleague Rep. Dunn to remove mental health care barriers for children on Medicaid. I’ll keep fighting to expand access to mental health services for Americans of all ages and backgrounds,” said Congresswoman Craig. Currently, a provider can only bill once per day for a Medicaid patient. This creates a barrier to mental health care when a child covered by Medicaid is seen for a primary care appointment and a mental health need is identified. If the primary care doctor wants to refer the patient to a mental health provider on staff, the practice cannot bill for the mental health service in the same day and get Medicaid reimbursement, creating an unnecessary barrier to care. “As a family physician, I know that improving access to mental health and primary care services for Medicaid beneficiaries is critical, particularly as we continue to see increased rates of youth mental health concerns. That’s why the American Academy of Family Physicians is pleased to endorse the Improving CARE for Youth Act, which will ensure Medicaid coverage of mental health and primary care services provided on the same day. The AAFP has long supported efforts to improve behavioral health integration in primary care and we are pleased this bipartisan legislation will help address coverage and financial barriers for patients.” – Steven P. Furr, MD, FAAFP, President, American Academy of Family Physicians.  “Pediatricians are witnessing the national emergency in youth mental health in our clinics, practices and hospitals across the country. Barriers to integrating mental health into pediatric primary such as insurance restrictions for same-day billing for a child’s medical and mental health care limit access to needed services. The Improving Coordination and Access to Resources Equitably for Youth Act would prohibit this practice in Medicaid thereby helping ensure that children can receive the care they need. The American Academy of Pediatrics endorses this legislation, urges its swift passage, and thanks Representatives Neal P. Dunn, MD (R-FL) and Angie Craig (D-Minn.) for their leadership on this legislation,” said American Academy of Pediatrics President Ben Hoffman, MD, FAAP.  “In the wake of a worsening youth mental health crisis, it’s essential that we make mental health services accessible to all children,” said Saul Levin, M.D., M.P.A., CEO and Medical Director of the American Psychiatric Association. “Removing Medicaid’s billing restrictions for those seeking mental health and primary care services on the same day will enhance integration and make care more accessible for those in need.” ### Permalink: https://dunn.house.gov/2024/4/congressman-dunn-introduces-bill-to-ensure-access-to-mental-health-services-for-children-on-medicaid"
April 3,Julia Brownley,D,Calif.-26,"Brownley Presents $963,000 to the County of Ventura for Regional Public Safety Radio Project","            In a hand delivered-letter to Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio following his address to the US Congress late last week, Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ) made a direct appeal to the Japanese leader to personally intervene and help return over 500 American children who have been abducted to Japan to their left-behind parents in the United States.             “As our two countries continue to take steps to strengthen our democratic, economic and security ties, I would like to draw your attention to an open wound that threatens to derail many ongoing efforts,” Smith wrote in his letter to Fumio.              “To date, more than 500 American children have been abducted to Japan by one of their respective parents and remain separated from their American parent. These abductions often occur against pre-existing court orders and, in some cases, with the passport assistance of the Japanese government,” Smith said in the letter.             In his letter, Smith cited just a few of the parents who have been denied access to their children in Japan, including Jeffery Morehouse—who has been fighting for the return of his young son Mochi since 2010 and has testified at several congressional hearings chaired by Smith. Despite having legal custody in Washington State which was recognized by Japanese courts, Morehouse still cannot gain access to his son in Japan.             Other parents who have testified before Smith’s committee and who were named in his letter include Retired Navy Capt. Paul Toland, Former Marine Corps Sgt. Michael Elias, and Randy Collins of California.             “For the sake of the children who are suffering, and for the sake of U.S. and Japanese relations, I seek your public commitment to reunite these families,” Smith continued in the letter. “I respectfully request that you work with the United States to create a process by which families can be reunited and heal.”             Smith, a renowned human rights defender who successfully fought for the return of a New Jersey child who had been abducted to Brazil in the mid-2000s and held there for five years, has chaired 16 comprehensive congressional hearings on the issue to date and authored the groundbreaking US law to combat international parental child abduction.             Signed into law in 2014, Smith’s Sean and David Goldman International Child Abduction Prevention and Return Act—named after the New Jersey father and son he helped reunite in 2009—empowers the US Executive Branch with tools to prevent the terrible crime of international parental child abduction and address the problem bilaterally with countries of particular concern. The law has helped with the return of other US citizen children, but Japan has not assisted in any notable returns.             “Mr. Prime Minister, there is no doubt that child abduction is a form of child abuse. Children who are kidnapped by one parent to live overseas and kept away from another are at grave risk of serious mental trauma, and may experience anxiety, eating disorder, nightmares, mood swings, sleep disturbances, aggressive behavior, resentment, guilt, and fearfulness,” Smith said in the letter.             “Regrettably, the abduction of American children to your country remains an ongoing human rights crisis that cannot be sidelined or overlooked. As I have said before, ‘when a country such as Japan has failed to resolve 30 percent of abduction cases that have been pending more than 12 months, U.S. law requires the Secretary of State to take action,’” the Smith letter continued.             “It is my sincere hope that these Japanese American children will become a source of strength between our two countries rather than a reminder of an ongoing injustice and a barrier to a robust United States-Japan relationship,” Smith said in the letter. ### Chris has three offices dedicated to constituent services.

April 16,Christopher H. Smith,R,N.J.-4,Smith chairs hearing on Turkeys shocking human rights abuses and aggressive transnational repression,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 9 April 2024 Contact: Kevin G. McGuire | 202-538-2386 Kevin.mcguire@mail.house.gov WASHINGTON, DC – Today, Congresswoman Nanette Barragán (CA-44) celebrated the passage of her bill, the Outdoors for All Act, in the House of Representatives as part of the bipartisan Expanding Public Lands Outdoor Recreation Experiences (EXPLORE) Act. The Outdoors for All Act, authored by Congresswoman Barragán, codifies the Outdoor Recreation Legacy Partnership (ORLP) program in federal law and modernizes the program to include smaller cities, tribes, and to fully account for the benefits parks provide. The ORLP supports urban parks in underserved communities.  “I am so excited to see my bill included in the EXPLORE Act to help millions of Americans more easily access green spaces,” said Rep. Barragán. “By passing the Outdoors for All Act, we make it crystal clear that funding for urban parks is here to stay.  Growing up in the Harbor Gateway, I had to take a bus to travel to a park for baseball practice. Far too many low-income communities like the one I grew up in lack access to a nearby green space.  By preserving the ORLP, we can provide much needed urban park funding for underserved communities throughout our country.”  The EXPLORE Act now heads to the Senate, which has also passed a bipartisan outdoor recreation bill, which includes Outdoors for All, through committee.  “Trust for Public Land commends the House of Representatives for passing the Outdoors for All Act as part of the bipartisan EXPLORE ACT,” said Luis Benitez, Chief Impact Officer forTrust for Public Land. “This legislation is of critical importance in addressing the severe park access gap affecting 100 million Americans, including 28 million children. Access to the outdoorsis a fundamental human need, and parks are not mere amenities but essential public infrastructure crucial for fostering healthier, more connected communities. Today’s vote was a significant step toward achieving equitable outdoor recreation opportunities for all communities across the country.  Trust for Public Land thanks Rep. Nanette Barragán for her leadership on Outdoors for All.  Rep. Barragán co-sponsored the original legislation and has shepherded it through the House – she is a true trailblazer for the creation of parks for the communities that can benefit the most.”  “The National Recreation and Park Association (NRPA) is thrilled to see the House of Representatives pass the EXPLORE Act package, including the bipartisan Outdoors for All Act, which will ensure that the Outdoor Recreation Legacy Partnership (ORLP) Program has steady funding for generations to come,” said Kristine Stratton, CEO of NRPA. “This marks a huge step toward securing a win for our more than 60,000 members and advocates, who work tirelessly to serve the public through park and recreation opportunities in urban and rural communities throughout the country, preserving and protecting the outdoors. We now urge the Senate to swiftly pass this bipartisan, critical piece of legislation.” “Whether it’s inaccessible trails, a lack of parks within walking distance, or the increasing costs and confusion of permits and fees, many families struggle to safely or affordably access our public lands,” said Robert Scott, Deputy Federal Policy Director of the Sierra Club. “It is wonderful to see the House acknowledge the importance of outdoor access by passing Outdoors For All, as part of the EXPLORE Act and improving access to the great outdoors.”  “The Outdoors for All Act will give Americans without adequate park access, particularly those living in low-income areas and indigenous communities, greater opportunities to experience green spaces and public lands,” said Lesley Kane Szynal, Chair of the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) Coalition.  “This strengthens and codifies the LWCF-funded Outdoor Recreation Legacy Partnership (ORLP) program making Tribes and more local communities directly eligible to receive program dollars.” “The Outdoors for All Act will leverage the power of nature to benefit millions of underserved communities who have gone without adequate funding to access quality green spaces,” said Daniel Rossman, California Deputy Director at The Wilderness Society. “By ensuring that more people – regardless of race, income or geography – can benefit from our nation’s public lands, this legislation will also advance better health outcomes, boost local economies and increase climate resilience for communities that need it most.” “KABOOM! applauds the passage of the Outdoors For All Act and Every Kid Outdoors program extension within the EXPLORE Act,” said Lysa Ratliff, CEO of KABOOM! “Nature and nature-based play are vital to a child’s healthy physical and mental development. Programs which reduce systemic barriers to these activities are critically important to ensure every child can experience the benefits that access to nature provides. We want to thank the long-time champions of these programs for prioritizing kids having access to the outdoors.”  “It is great to see Congress acknowledge the importance of inclusive legislation and on a bipartisan level by passing the EXPLORE Act,” said Julia Hurwit, Campaign Manager forOAK. “Members of the Outdoors Alliance for Kids (OAK) are united by a shared mission to help more children, youth and families access the outdoors. The EXPLORE Act is going to provide a solid foundation for our work for the next few years by increasing the opportunities for children to access public lands, expanding options for families that want to spend time in nature, and offering safe and improved outdoor recreation amenities to communities.” “At REI Co-op we believe everyone should have easy access to nature, yet 100 million Americans lack access to a quality green space close to home,” said Taldi Harrison, Director of Community & Government Affairs, REI Co-op. “The EXPLORE Act, a first-of-its-kind package of outdoor recreation bills, will both strengthen our public lands and increase opportunities forall people to enjoy time outside. The bill centers bipartisan solutions that increase equitable access to the outdoors by increasing resources for outdoor recreation, including long-distance trails and urban parks in historically overlooked communities.” “We are thrilled to see Congress taking action to ensure each American has the opportunity to enjoy outdoor spaces in their own community, bolster economic growth, and advance mental and physical health benefits for all,” said Kent Ebersole, president of Outdoor Industry Association. “The outdoor recreation economy continues to soar to new levels, accounting for over $1 trillion in consumer spending and demonstrating participant growth for the eighth consecutive year. This is an important inflection point. We must modernize, preserve, and increase access to the public lands and waterways – regardless of where someone lives or works – and support more than five million employees who help drive our industry forward.”  # # # Congressmember Nanette Barragán represents California’s 44th District.  She sits on the House Energy and Commerce Committee and works on environmental justice and healthcare issues.  She is also Chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC).

April 16,Christopher H. Smith,R,N.J.-4,"<span class=""kicker"">Communist China exploits African children to power Green Economy </span>Smith introduces bill aimed at preventing cobalt mined by child exploitation and forced labor in the Congo from entering US market","FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE | Contact: Olivia Porcaro 202-225-6165 Today, April 15th, is Tax Day – the day that individual income tax returns are due to be submitted to the federal government. As the American people and I file our tax returns today, I am reflecting on the American economy and the importance of pro-growth tax policy in our nation.   Long ago, the United States of America became known as the economic powerhouse of the globe – having the largest economy in the world. Since then, we have remained a global leader in business and innovation. However, our nation is now locked in an increasingly intense economic rivalry with China. In fact, put together, the United States and China make up about 40 percent of global output.   Now, as this rivalry continues to intensify, it is important to note that the U.S. economy does beat out China’s by dollar value. Yet, China dominates the supply chains for necessities like solar panels, electronics, cars, steel, plastic, batteries, and other everyday goods. So, in order to remain as the economic leader of the world, it is important to ensure that our domestic tax code fosters a favorable economic environment that encourages American innovation, which will, in turn, give us a stronger competitive edge against Communist China.  This is why, in 2017, I supported historic, pro-growth tax reform legislation that helped our economy boom and allowed Americans to keep more of their hard-earned money – the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. In fact, according to the Tax Foundation, in Oklahoma alone, this bill helped to create more than 3,870 jobs and raised the median household income by over $560.  In addition to promoting individual economic growth, I am a strong believer in maintaining a competitive corporate tax code in order to incentivize businesses to set up and maintain operations in America, rather than moving abroad. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act did just that by reducing the corporate tax rate, and, in turn, allowing American businesses to flourish within our borders, instead of within China’s.  Now, I also want to emphasize that a competitive corporate tax code does not just benefit large American corporations.   As an Oklahoman, I know the importance of small businesses back at home. In fact, small businesses employ more than half of Oklahomans and are very vital to our state’s economy. Rest assured - the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act’s reduction of the corporate tax rate benefits them too, as it allows them to keep more of their earnings, and, therefore, expand operations and employ more workers.  Lastly, I believe increasing the child tax credit is imperative. This, along with many other reasons, is why I was proud to support the bipartisan Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act earlier this year. This bill builds on the successful Tax Cuts and Jobs Act by providing $20 billion in enhancements for the child tax credit, as well as $200 billion in tax incentives for job creators and American workers.  At the end of the day, the U.S. tax code should be written to benefit the American economy, families, workers, and small businesses, not hurt them. However, in recent years, it has not felt this way, as Americans are being crushed by high interest rates, skyrocketing inflation, and lower real wages. This is unacceptable. As we come up on the expiration of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2025, it is imperative that Congress and the Administration work together to sign legislation, like the Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act, into law. We must give our economy a much-needed boost, expand growth and opportunity, increase America’s competitive edge, and do everything we can to remain the economic powerhouse of the world. E-mail Me"
April 16,Morgan Griffith,R,Va.-9,"Griffith Announces $1,266,794 HHS Grant to Rocky Mounts STEP, Inc","This Week With Gosar April 14, 2024     Gosar Votes Against Spy Bill, Overwhelming Majority Polled Oppose FISA This week, I voted against legislation reauthorizing Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) for two more years.   A few months ago, I wrote an Op-Ed expressing my concerns about reauthorizing FISA without significant reform.  If you missed it, here it is!  Backup: Section 702 of FISA was enacted by Congress in 2008 to ostensibly allow the United States intelligence community, including the FBI, to surveil foreigners located abroad. Purportedly, Congress wrote this law to protect our national security by allowing spying on non-U.S. threats without a court order. However, FISA was never intended to spy on U.S. citizens.    Unfortunately, Section 702 has been controversial since its inception, and it has been highly scrutinized by civil liberties advocates and privacy rights activists.   The government's ability to collect and analyze the communications of foreigners without a warrant has also led to the collection of communications of American citizens and raises serious concerns about the indiscriminate and broad nature of the surveillance program, further infringing on the rights of Americans.   For example, the FBI has abused Section 702 to conduct warrantless searches against American citizens more than 278,000 times.  Unless it is reauthorized by Congress, FISA is set to expire next Friday.  Now that you’re up to speed, several amendments were offered that would have reformed FISA including a commonsense amendment offered by my friend, Representative Biggs, that I voted for that would have prevented warrantless searches of Americans.  Sadly, 86 Republicans and 126 Democrats inexplicably voted to allow the deep state to continue spying on Americans without a warrant by voting down this amendment.   As a result, I could not support the warrantless surveillance of American reauthorized under section 702.  It is a clear overreach of authority and is a direct violation of the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures.  Earlier this week and before voting, I sent a flash poll to faithful Gosar Newsletter readers asking you to share your opinion on whether FISA should be reauthorized.  2,367 individuals voted and here are the results:  🔢 2216 (96%) urged that I vote against reauthorizing FISA; 🔢 95 (4%) asked that I vote to reauthorize FISA; 🔢 10 (less than 1%) were undecided.  Thank you to everyone who responded to my poll!   Click here to read my press release further explaining why I voted against reauthorizing FISA.     Democrats Oppose Adding Citizenship Question to Census This week, the House Oversight and Accountability Committee on which I serve passed H.R. 7109, the Equal Representation Act, legislation to add a new question to the decennial census.    ❓❓Congressman Gosar: what was the question, you might ask? ❓❓  Are you a citizen? YES or NO.   Not surprisingly, every Democrat on the committee voted against this commonsense legislation.   Currently, the decennial census counts illegal aliens for purposes of reapportionment and allocating congressional seats. Thus, states that harbor illegal aliens will have their population numbers increased. With a population increase, those states may well get additional congressional seats in the House of Representatives and other states will lose seats.  The surge of illegal aliens will generally benefit blue states and cause Congress to have an artificially high number of Democrat congressional districts.   Illegal immigration is a crime. Why are we awarding those who break our laws with Congressional representation?  Because Democrats would rather have a wide-open southern border than a safe America. This is being done intentionally. It’s all about power.  Now that it has been voted out of committee, H.R. 7109, the Equal Representation Act, now goes to the House floor for a vote by every Member of Congress.  I will be sure to keep you updated!    Congress Passes Bill Improving Access to Outdoor Recreation on Public Lands  Also this week, Congress passed H.R. 6492, the Expanding Public Lands Outdoor Recreation Experiences Act, or the EXPLORE Act.  The EXPLORE Act makes it easier for every American to enjoy our beautiful public lands and waters by promoting recreation opportunities for active service members and veterans, creating new long-distance bike trails, improving access for sportsmen and women, streamlining permitting for outfitters and guides, protecting rock climbing in iconic places, modernizing campgrounds, and much more.  Our nation is blessed with some of the most beautiful lands and waters in the world, it is only right that Congress makes them available for all Americans to enjoy.  🚴 🎣 🛶 🏃‍♀️ 🧗 🏂 ⛺🌲   Congress Passes Legislation Long Championed by Gosar to Build Veterans Center in Gila County This week the House passed H.R. 1829, legislation I cosponsored with Representative Crane requiring the Secretary of Agriculture to convey the Pleasant Valley Ranger District Administrative Site to Gila County, Arizona.  This bill would utilize 232 acres located in northern Arizona to build a veterans retreat and community center by transferring the Pleasant Valley Administrative Site and accompanying Forest Service land to Gila County.  The community center will provide a gathering space for veterans and their families to host retreats, meetings, and other events. The area would also serve as a location for a mobile veterans’ clinic for veterans who cannot easily access a VA Medical Center.   Completing this land transfer will open the door for new support services for veterans in northern Arizona.  For years, I have long-championed this bipartisan cause and I am very pleased that this effort is gaining momentum.     Gosar Hosts Successful Military Academy Day Thank you to all the High School Juniors, Seniors and parents who attended my Military Academy Day earlier this week to learn more about how to receive a congressional nomination to a United States military service academy.  I am very impressed with the qualifications of the students and wish them all the best as they pursue an appointment.     It’s Mail Time! I’ve received a ton of mail each week and I appreciate hearing from everyone, including those who disagree.  Here are samples of some of the letters sent in this week:  📨 Frank Z. from Prescott, AZ is a frequent critic who shared this incredibly intelligent comment this week 😂: MORON!!!!  👉 Frank, thanks for the very “thoughtful” remark.  I will share with you the same advice I used to give my children: act your age, not your shoe size!    📨 Robert M. from Goodyear, AZ writes✏: I am not in favor of the renewal of FISA and can’t believe Mike Johnson cast the deciding vote for it. We need to sharply curtail the power of the federal government to spy on US citizens since it’s clear that the government is incapable of keeping politics out of their decisions.  👉 Dear Robert, I won’t sugar-coat it: I too am in disbelief of the vote. As I noted above, there were several good amendments that would have reformed FISA, none more important than an amendment that, if passed, would have required a warrant to spy on Americans.  It failed, 212-212 was the final tally.  In Congress, a tie means the vote fails.  There are no tiebreakers.  One additional vote was all that was needed, yet the Speaker voted with the UNIPARTY causing the amendment to fail.   📨 Cynthia W. from Kingman, AZ shares, in part, this note: Anyone harmed by the COVID vaccine should be allowed to be compensated by the manufacturer of the product. We must hold these companies responsible. Right now, Americans cannot sue a manufacturer or health provider if they or a family member are injured or killed by a COVID product. There have been well over one million claims of injury and death from COVID products reported. The COVID shot – in just over three years – racked up as many VAERS reports as all other vaccines combined since 1988. COVID products wouldn’t exist if manufacturers could be sued for harm.  The CDC continues to recommend COVID shots for our children, even though many countries, including Britain, France, Japan, Australia, and India, decided not to recommend boosters, or any shot at all for healthy children. This issue is not going away, and Americans are being harmed by not having the constitutional protection of trial by jury.   👉 Cynthia, there is ample evidence of the existence of injuries caused by vaccines.  Unfortunately, the Big Pharma lobby has prevented the U.S. government from collecting quality statistics of vaccine injuries, instead relying on the inadequate Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting system, which is compiled from self-reporting.     The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 makes it almost impossible for those harmed by vaccines to sue Big Pharma in court.     I don’t believe that pharmaceutical companies should get a special carve-out.  Most producers of other market materials can be sued for defects caused by their products.  That is why I am considering action, including legislation, to level the playing field by making vaccine manufacturers responsible for the injuries and harms caused by their vaccines.   Tweet of the Week:   Photo of the Week:    📸 Bart Anderson from Bullhead City, AZ shares this great photo he snapped in Golden Valley on a recent drive.  Fantastic photo, Bart.  Thanks for sharing.   ❓Do you have photography skills?  Do you want the chance for your photograph to be featured as our ""Picture of the Week?""   If so, send your best shots of our great state along with a brief description to Anthony.foti@mail.house.gov.  Remember to include your name and where you live.    Gosar in the News and Other Must-Read Stories:  📰 Daily Mail: Republicans demand the Biden administration explain an 'outrageous' $37.7 million fine imposed on a Christian university and accuse the Education Department of 'inappropriately targeting' the country's largest Christian school  🗞 The Hill: Gosar votes to block the spy powers bill  📰 The Daily Signal: Biden Education Secretary Refuses to Answer Whether ‘Women Are Physically Different Than Men’  🗞 The Daily Signal: SECURITYNEWS HOUSE DIVIDED: Bipartisan Effort to Bar Warrantless Searches of US Citizens Falls Short  📰 The Gateway Pundit: TYRANNY: House PASSES Bill to Renew FISA Warrantless Spy Program by 273-147 Vote – Here’s the 126 Republicans Who Voted YES to Snoop on Americans Without Meaningful Limits  🗞 The National Pulse: REVEALED: The *REAL* Inflation Numbers, Which Biden Doesn’t Want You to See, Nor Share.  📰 The National Pulse: The Vatican Just Released a New Pronouncement on Gender Transitioning…  🗞 Wall Street Journal: The Inflation Thief Rises Again  📰 The Center Square: Tucson CBP agents seizing enough fentanyl, meth to kill billions of people  🗞 Fox News: DOJ will not turn over Biden's recorded interview with Special Counsel Hur, risking contempt of Congress  Warning!!  The Gosar Weekly Newsletter is meant for discerning readers with above average intelligence.  If you are a reporter, it probably means you are in over your head already.  We link to interesting stories.  We get stories a couple different ways: Google alerts, a third-party aggregator and sometimes readers send stuff.  We don’t vouch for every publication or every author.  If we link to a story, it is because of that story. The views expressed in any of the publications do not represent any promotion, endorsement or reflection of Congressman Gosar’s views.  While we try our best, we cannot guarantee every news organization spouting hatred, animosity or divisiveness will be filtered from appearing in the Gosar Weekly Newsletter.  We will endeavor to prevent that from happening by never linking to Fake News organizations including CNN, MSNBC, CNBC, Rolling Stone, the Arizona Republic, the Arizona Mirror, Media Matters or the New Republic.   "
April 16,Morgan Griffith,R,Va.-9,"Griffith Announces $1,044,168 HHS Grant to Scott County Public School Head Start Program","Press Release April 11, 2024 WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Representative David Schweikert (AZ-01) authored an op-ed for the Phoenix Business Journal yesterday to advocate for the proven pro-growth policies in the Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act, bipartisan legislation that will provide much-needed relief to struggling families and small businesses, spur innovation and job creation, and invest in the future of all Arizonans. Rep. Schweikert called on the U.S. Senate to swiftly pass the bipartisan tax package which passed the House with bipartisan support more than two months ago.  My View: Bipartisan tax package would help Arizona businesses growBy Congressman David SchweikertPhoenix Business JournalApril 10, 2024 Since first coming to Congress, my mission has been to help small businesses and families thrive in Arizona. As a staunch advocate for fiscal responsibility and economic prosperity, I’ve fought to foster a business environment where small businesses can succeed, innovation is incentivized, and workers and families are empowered. Small businesses form the backbone of our local economy, making up over 92% of the shops and restaurants in Scottsdale. While traveling across the district, I frequently hear from business owners and listen to their concerns. Through my position on the House Committee on Ways and Means, which serves as Congress’s chief tax-writing committee, I enthusiastically work to advance meaningful tax policy that promotes economic growth and ensures prosperity for future generations. Nearly seven years ago, I was proud to play an instrumental role in helping write the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), perhaps our nation’s most sweeping overhaul of the federal tax code in decades. In the first two years after TCJA, our country witnessed record-low unemployment, thousands of jobs created, and higher wages. This landmark legislation simultaneously lowered the tax burden for small businesses and American workers while encouraging innovation and competition to boost economic growth. Building off the success of TCJA, my colleagues and I worked to provide small businesses and households with targeted, immediate relief through the Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act. This bipartisan tax package, which passed the House by a vote of 357-70, would revive proven pro-growth policies like restoring full and immediate research and development expensing and 100% bonus depreciation. Modernization and productivity play critical roles in expanding the economy, and these two provisions promise to spur the next generation of economic disruptors and turbocharge investments in capital equipment and machinery. R&D expensing can boost productivity, growth Simply put, R&D expensing is an investment in our country’s economic future. Allowing businesses to deduct R&D expenditures ensures that money otherwise used for bearing the financial burdens of running a business can be reinvested into developing technology and innovative solutions that will enhance productivity, boost global competitiveness, and stimulate economic growth. This provision alone is estimated to generate over $70 billion in new R&D investment and support over 21 million American jobs while providing the government with more than an 8-to-1 return on its investment. Similarly, the Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act extends the allowance of a 100% bonus deduction for capital equipment and assets, giving businesses the green light to streamline their operations, upgrade manufacturing equipment and heavy machinery, and embrace state-of-the-art innovations that drive productivity. This provision is estimated to increase investment by $400 billion and create 73,000 new jobs. By providing small businesses with the resources and incentives they need to modernize and grow, we can unleash the full potential of the American economy and strengthen our nation’s economic resilience, competitiveness, and leadership on the global stage. The Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act underscores the moral imperative of economic growth. As our economy expands, so does our revenue, and without growth, the government lacks a critical tool in restoring the fiscal sanity of the U.S. government.  This bipartisan tax bill provides much-needed relief to struggling families and small businesses, spurs innovation and job creation, and paves the way for a brighter and more prosperous future for all Arizonans. Now, this tax package awaits its fate in the Senate, while every day that passes is a wasted opportunity to deliver for our communities in need. Bipartisan victories are few and far between in this Congress. We have the chance to enact meaningful and impactful tax reform for hardworking Americans. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to seize this moment and act in the best interest of our nation’s economic future. Office Locations

April 16,Andy Biggs,R,Ariz.-5,Continuing the Fight for Americans' Privacy,"Press Release April 12, 2024 WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Representative David Schweikert (AZ-01) delivered a speech on the House Floor last night to warn about the disinformation campaign being waged by foreign countries like China, Russia, and Iran through the weaponization of artificial intelligence. Rep. Schweikert also discussed the terrifying reality that the federal government recently crossed the threshold of borrowing $100,000 per second. Excerpts from Rep. Schweikert’s floor speech can be found below: Click here or on the image above to view Rep. Schweikert’s remarks.On foreign governments weaponizing AI to spread misinformation: [Beginning at 2:13]“We don’t actually understand it, but we have a war going on, and it’s a war for hearts and minds and there are bad actors around this world. The number of data points we have here showing particularly China, Russia, Iran, and it’s getting weaponized at a level I don’t think any of us are intellectually ready for because AI is here. The plain language is here, and they’re moving off of just your Facebook page or your social media accounts. It is moving into now fake text messages, all sorts of other ways where they’re going to try to pollute and take down the West. And we are not the only ones. We have map after map of what China just did to Taiwan. Now, Taiwan actually has built a policy on how to help combat it. They get attacked on social media with fake stuff. They have teams that turn around and say, ‘Okay, here’s what they said. Here’s the documents. Look it up yourself.’ I don’t think we are ready for this.“How do you and I and our brothers and sisters on the Left and anyone who actually cares about this country, how do you have honest debates, honest discussions about that? In my case, I am fearful of the crushing debt. We’re going to walk through that. But other policy things, when you actually lay out facts, you lay out the information of what’s going on, and 90 seconds later there is a bot that basically is putting out absolute crap. How do you hold a society together but you can’t even agree on the baseline facts to build the debate from when article after article — some of these are huge. I brought the executive summaries. I mean, some of the ones we have gone through are hundreds of pages of tracking entire troll farms. There’s one document here saying that China may be spending multiple billions of dollars in influence operations here in this country to basically distort reality. And the point I’m going at right now, this seems like a weird place to go for a guy who wants to talk about the numbers of what’s happening in our government. I’m incredibly frustrated because I do not know how we have an honest debate when we have a disinformation wave coming at us from functionally governments, let alone the private troll farms that do it just for clickbait to make money.” On inflation’s impacts on the Phoenix-Scottsdale area: [Beginning at 21:31]“Why is the public so cranky? Seriously. I tried to have this conversation with folks at home, and I am blessed. I represent the Phoenix-Scottsdale area. If you have to represent a district, I represent one of the most beautiful spots, particularly in the winter months. I represent a fairly prosperous district. I represent a really well-educated district, a really entrepreneurial district. And yet a lot of my folks who if you see on the surface, they’re doing fairly well in life, and they’re stressed out of their minds because in my district, we have had the highest inflation in the continental United States. If you do not make 23.6% more money today than you did the day President Biden took office, you are poorer. So no matter what economic data this Body of Congress wants to talk about over and over and over. This is what matters when you actually look at the data of those who are non-supervisory or supervisory. Today they are poorer even when you put back in wage growth. Our brothers and sisters in America are poorer today, and in my district it’s worse. And I have a prosperous district. You want to understand why people are struggling and angry and frustrated. Maybe an honest conversation that we made them poorer.” On debt growth outpacing economic growth: [Beginning at 28:08]“But if you have someone who says we’ll just grow ourselves out of borrowing $100,000 a second, they are not good at math. Here’s the basic, simple rule. GDP — the size of the economy in 2023 — grew $1.5 trillion. Yay. But you do understand for that growth, you only get 17-18%, maybe even 19% of that in tax receipts. So in the growth, that’s wonderful, but it is not dollar-for-dollar. And so I will get people and say, ‘Okay, you guys borrowed $2.5 trillion. But the economy grew $1.5 trillion.’ Yes, it did grow [by $1.5 trillion], but I only get 17-18-19% of that in tax receipts. Do you understand the scale of growth you’d have to have for the tax receipts to come close to the borrowing?” Office Locations

I will also continue to support ongoing efforts by the administration to de-escalate this conflict. However, statements on social media are not how we support our allies. For two months, Speaker Johnson has failed to bring the Senate National Security Supplemental or any aid package up for consideration in the House.  On March 12, 2024, I signed a discharge petition to force a vote on the bipartisan legislation. Yet the Speaker has taken no action. My commitment to safeguarding our national security interests and supporting our foreign allies in Israel, Ukraine, Taiwan and humanitarian aid is unwavering.  There cannot be any further delays. The House must vote on the national security supplemental when we return tomorrow.""

April 15,Marsha Blackburn,R,Tenn.,BREAKING: Senate Democrats Block Blackburn Effort To Immediately Aid Israel,"Washington, D.C. – Today, Representatives Scott Peters (CA-50), Juan Vargas (CA-52), Mike Levin (CA-49), and Sara Jacobs (CA-51) announced $39 million in Shelter and Services Program (SSP) funding for non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and partners in the greater San Diego region that support migrant communities seeking shelter, food, and other critical resources. San Diego County and the Catholic Charities each received $19,592,554 in SSP funding to assist with migrant arrivals. “People who seek asylum and refuge in the U.S. should be treated with respect and dignity,” said Rep. Scott Peters. “This funding will allow San Diego nonprofits to continue to provide desperately needed humanitarian aid to individuals and families as they await an immigration court hearing and transportation to another part of the country. I thank the Biden administration and urge Congress to pass the bipartisan border security agreement, which would provide an additional $1.4 billion in SSP funds, speed up the judicial process, and give resources to Customs and Border Protection to better manage the border.”  “The San Diego area has a long tradition of welcoming individuals seeking asylum and refuge with open arms. I’m proud to have worked alongside my San Diego delegation colleagues to secure this critical funding for communities and organizations aiding migrants,” said Rep. Vargas. “This funding will help make sure they have the resources they need to continue their important work to provide migrant communities with food, shelter, and other critical services.” “All migrants deserve to be treated humanely, and San Diego is striving to be the model for communities receiving migrants across the country. I’m proud that my colleagues and I in the San Diego delegation secured this critical funding, which will help ensure migrants are welcomed with dignity and respect,” said Rep. Levin.“This funding will help our local partners provide additional resources to meet migrants’ basic human needs and reduce the impact on the existing safety net, including on homeless shelters. While I welcome this announcement, I also know we have more work to do. Congress must pass the bipartisan border security agreement, which would in part provide additional SSP funds.” “The Shelter and Services Program (SSP) is one of our best tools to ensure that our country is living up to our values and treating migrants and asylum seekers with dignity and respect,” said Rep. Sara Jacobs “That’s why I’m so proud that our San Diego congressional delegation secured another $640 million in federal funds for this program, guaranteeing millions of dollars for San Diego. As always, we will keep pushing for comprehensive immigration reform to address the root causes of migration, relieve the strain on our asylum processing system, and expand the legal pathways for people to stay and work in the U.S., but this funding will go a long way to addressing our immediate concerns regarding the housing, safety, and needs of migrants and asylum seekers in San Diego.” In February, Members of San Diego’s Congressional delegation urged Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to release available funding for SSP under Fiscal Year 2024 (FY24) Continuing Resolutions (CR).

April 11,Jack Reed,D,R.I.,"To Combat Gun Violence, DOJ Implements Reed-Backed Law to Close ‘Gun Show Loophole’ & Require Background Checks for Online Firearm Sales as Well"," For Immediate Release Congressman Jamaal Bowman Ed.D. (NY-16) released the following statement: In this critical moment, we need to engage with peace, not weapons. I unequivocally condemn the Iranian military’s attack on Israel, just as I condemn the Israeli military attack on the Iranian consulate in Syria ordered by Prime Minister Netanyahu that sparked this dangerous escalation. While there were no fatalities, shrapnel from an Iranian missile did severely injure Amina al-Hassouni, the seven-year old Bedouin girl, and I am praying for her swift recovery. I am deeply concerned by those demanding military reprisal. That is why I stand in support of President Biden’s immediate call to de-escalate this situation, and his actions to prevent the further spread of violence in the region. It is clearer than ever that Benjamin Netanyahu’s warmongering is putting the lives of millions of civilians at risk, including the Israeli people. It is why even as I condemned Hamas’ horrific attacks on October 7, I also called for immediate de-escalation and a ceasefire. We cannot condemn violence on one hand and then condone it in the other. The collective punishment leveled against the Palestinian people as well as Israeli military actions in Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, and Iraq have created a dangerous powder keg that threatens to become a regional war. Netanyahu is willing to endanger the lives of millions just to draw the US deeper into a conflict whose flame he fans. The path to peace starts with ensuring safety for people in the region. A majority of Americans want a permanent ceasefire, and support for Netanyahu in both the US and Israel shrinks by the day. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are starving to death in Gaza right now, including tens of thousands of children. Millions across the region fear being drawn into a bloody conflict orchestrated by madmen. Antisemitism and Islamophobia are on the rise in our very own country. We need de-escalation, restraint, a lasting ceasefire, and diplomacy. It is the only way forward, not just for Palestinians and Israelis, but us all.

April 13,Jack Reed,D,R.I.,Reed Statement on Iranian Attack Against Israel,"WASHINGTON—House Committee on Oversight and Accountability Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.) today opened a hearing titled “Oversight of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration” to bring transparency to a pattern of issues within the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ensure the FDA is prioritizing safety and effectiveness and incentivizing innovation.  Below are Chairman Comer’s remarks as prepared for delivery. Welcome to the Committee on Oversight and Accountability. We thank Commissioner Califf for his participation in today’s oversight hearing of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. There might not be a federal agency that is more integral to Americans’ day-to-day lives than the FDA. FDA is charged with regulatory oversight of the food and drug industries. Industries that ensure Americans have food on the table by innovating safer and more stable crops. Industries that provide Americans new medications to treat debilitating diseases. Industries that create cutting-edge medical devices that can keep your heart pumping or help replace a knee. These industries are vital to keep Americans safe, healthy, and happy. These industries provide millions of jobs and nearly $3 trillion in economic value. Congress must ensure the FDA is prioritizing safety and effectiveness but also incentivizing innovation. Unfortunately, the FDA under President Biden is suffering from dysfunction and is failing to do the bare minimum to carry out its core mission—make certain our nation’s food and drug products are safe and effective. Further, the FDA appears consistently unprepared for crises.   That is why our Committee has conducted several investigations into areas of concern at the FDA. These investigations have identified a pattern of issues within the FDA. At the beginning of the Congress, Subcommittee Chairwoman McClain launched an investigation into the infant formula crisis. Her Subcommittee revealed how the FDA attempted to hide behind the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse for neglecting facility inspections and justifying poor performance. The FDA’s telework policies and lax approach to oversight left it unprepared to address the shortages when Abbott’s facility in Sturgis, Michigan was shut down. Additionally, the Biden White House and the FDA took three months to act to increase production of infant formula. The result of these failures? Barren shelves, leaving millions of young families unable to access the formula needed to feed their babies. We have also investigated the FDA’s failure to prepare for and adequately respond to drug shortages for essential medications used to treat infection, heart disease, and cancer, just to name a few examples. FDA and Democratic policies, such as the Inflation Reduction Act, have dramatically diminished the profitability of manufacturing generic medications. This has resulted in fewer manufacturers and a greater risk of shortage. The FDA must improve coordination with manufacturers and federal agencies, including DEA, DOJ, and DOD to increase production. The FDA has failed to incentivize domestic manufacturing of pharmaceuticals resulting in significant off-shoring of these facilities. We conducted oversight of the FDA’s failure to return to pre-pandemic levels of inspections of those manufacturing facilities for prescription drugs abroad. Inspections of foreign manufacturing facilities were 79 percent lower in 2022 than 2019. Last year alone, this failure resulted in two separate recalls of eye drops manufactured in India that caused an outbreak of dangerous drug-resistant bacteria killing four people. Through our investigation of tobacco products regulations, we learned the FDA is failing to consistently and effectively regulate tobacco products. According to the Reagan-Udall Foundation, the FDA has been “reactive and overwhelmed” in its tobacco products regulation. The FDA has delayed review of applications for products that can reduce harm for many Americans. Further, the FDA’s failure to regulate has allowed unsafe and illicit products to proliferate. In fact, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit slammed the FDA for “[sending] manufacturers of flavored e-cigarette products on a wild goose chase.” Meanwhile, the FDA is also failing to prevent illicit flavored tobacco products from China entering the country and harming Americans. The FDA is not implementing enforcement actions to address illicit flavored tobacco products in stores across the country. Additionally, the Committee examined the FDA’s refusal to regulate hemp-derived products such as CBD. Instead of using its existing authorities, the FDA is requesting new authorities and money that it does not need. This is the FDA putting its own bureaucratic priorities over the American people who can benefit from these products. The FDA’s refusal to regulate hemp products is creating significant confusion in the market and resulting in products with intoxicants that may be dangerous to Americans who use these products. It has also halted businesses trying—in good faith—to enter the market, while bad actors continue to thrive. Finally, we have found that the FDA ignored decades of research regarding the ineffectiveness of an over-the-counter decongestant causing Americans to waste their hard-earned money on a medication that is simply ineffective. These examples are just scratching the surface of the dysfunction and failures that are ongoing within the FDA. Today I’m hopeful we can take a deep dive to better understand how the FDA is responding and taking action to ensure a safe food and drug supply. I now yield to the Ranking Member.

""Joe Biden’s catastrophic weakness on the world stage and his failure to support Israel our most precious ally emboldened Iran to launch a direct attack on Israel. As soon as Joe Biden took office, he reversed President Trump’s Maximum Pressure Campaign on Iran and less than six months ago he allowed critical international sanctions on Iran’s missile and drone programs to expire, empowering Iran to launch this massive strike. The United States must stand with Israel and offer our unwavering support.""

April 15,Kevin Cramer,R,N.D.,Senator Cramer Joins Colleagues in Calling for Reforms of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Section 702,"Washington, D.C.- In case you missed it, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik published an op-ed in Real Clear Defense highlighting the need for the Department of Defense to better identify organizations that embrace innovation and enable them to transition technology to the warfighter highlighting Future Flag’s model of experimentation and active risk reduction. The Joint Future Flag Experiment led by Air Force Research Lab-Rome offers an opportunity for the Department of Defense to experiment, test, and evaluate emerging technologies in the town of Lewis in Essex County, New York. Read the full article below. Real Clear Defense: The Air Force’s Future Flag Experiment Is A Success By Rep. Elise Stefanik New York’s 21st Congressional District has a long and distinguished history of playing a critical role in U.S. national security. From the renowned Battles of Saratoga that turned the tide of the Revolutionary War to the work of Strategic Air Command’s missileers at Plattsburgh Air Force Base during the Cold War, to today’s continued service of the 10th Mountain Division at Fort Drum, the region’s history of service and innovation is ingrained in Upstate New York and North Country culture. In today’s global climate of competition and instability, the innovative ecosystem in NY-21 is more critical than ever.  Carrying on the region’s tradition of service and conducted annually in Lewis, New York, the Joint Future Flag Experiment led by Air Force Research Lab-Rome (AFRL-Rome) offers a unique opportunity for the Department of Defense (DoD) to experiment, test, and evaluate emerging technologies while they are in the hands of operators. Designed as a joint operational and laboratory effort, Future Flag brings together operational personnel, research and development teams, and government and industry, to enable rapid design, solution development, and prototyping. Future Flag cuts through the bureaucracy to effectively integrate technology for the warfighter at the speed of relevance in today’s ever-changing world without the typical constraints found in the DoD. The key to this effort is the objective experimentation’s focus on collaboration across multiple communities with direct and unfiltered exchange of ideas and concepts. Seldom do operators, developers, and engineers have a chance to work together in small unit level operational settings. Future Flag offers the opportunity to reduce risk, focus limited resources, and provide the warfighter with new and unique capabilities targeting their actual needs, not poorly conceived and out-of-date requirements. Future Flag’s results are sent forward into large scale exercises like Northern Edge, or into Combatant Commands (COCOMs) where they are directly impacting current operations. Future Flag creates a process where industry can iterate and develop technologies unconstrained by conventional doctrine. The goal of developing new technologies is to provide new capabilities, which in turn require new doctrine. Unlike traditional approaches to development that allow for only slow evolution of doctrine to exploit new and emerging capabilities, Future Flag starts by throwing out conventional doctrinal constraints, allowing the operators and engineers to push their limits and test the art of the possible to rapidly provide vital capabilities to the warfighter. The Future Flag series is already yielding critical results that are contributing to strategic deterrence in the Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM). The Air Force’s Air Combat Command worked with the Future Flag team to rapidly experiment with edge computing for the MQ-9 Reaper’s M2DO (Multi Domain) configuration in Lewis, NY. These experiments directly resulted in enhancing the MQ-9 platform with critical command and control and electro-optical/infra-red sensing capabilities, significantly increasing the Air Force’s ability to conduct unmanned-Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance missions in INDOPACOM. It is critical that we continue to provide our service members with resources to conduct these vital missions. Following my advocacy, the final FY 2024 defense appropriations bill included $25 million for Air Force Research Laboratory-Rome to expand the scope of Future Flag. In keeping with my commitment to provide our warfighters with the very best capabilities, Future Flag represents one of the earliest and most effective forays into the arena of contractor owned, contractor operated large scale operational laboratories in the nation. The DoD must better identify organizations and activities that embrace innovation, like Future Flag, and enable them to transition technology to the warfighter. To truly innovate and get capabilities to the warfighter at relevant speed and scale, DoD must scale Future Flag’s innovative model of aggressive experimentation and active risk reduction. The DoD’s repeated failure to appropriately manage risk in pursuit of innovation only shifts the risk to the operational community. Future Flag must be the standard in testing, evaluation, and experimentation, not the exception. The stakes are too high to fail at placing anything but the best capabilities in the hands of the warfighter.  Permalink: https://stefanik.house.gov/2024/4/icymi-stefanik-oped-in-real-clear-defense-the-air-force-s-future-flag-experiment-is-a-success 2211 Rayburn House Office Building Washington, DC 20515 Phone: (202) 225-4611 137 Margaret Street, Suite 100 Plattsburgh, NY 12901 Phone: (518) 561-2324 Fax: (518) 561-2408 330 Ford Street, Suite B8 Ogdensburg, NY 13669 Phone: (315) 541-2670 99 Troy Road, Suite 312 East Greenbush, NY 12061 Phone: (518) 242-4707 Phone: (315) 219-8005"

This is an alarming escalation. Now more than ever, it is critical for us to stand by our friend and ally. As President Biden has made clear: ""Our support for Israel’s security is ironclad. The United States will stand with the people of Israel and support their defense against these threats from Iran."" We are praying for the safety and security of Israel.” ###"
April 13,Michael R. Turner,R,Ohio-10,Turner Statement on the Passing of Don Donoher,"  Washington D.C. (Apr. 14, 2024) — Congresswoman Cori Bush (MO-01) released the following statement: “I am deeply concerned by the Iranian military’s attack on Israel, which comes in response to the Israeli military’s attack on the Iranian Embassy in Syria. I condemn these attacks, which threaten civilian lives and regional war. I also condemn the calls by Members of Congress and others to initiate war with Iran; to do so without Congressional authorization is blatantly unconstitutional. I’m encouraged by reporting that President Biden advised Prime Minister Netanyahu last night that the U.S. will oppose any Israeli counter-attacks against Iran, and I urge the President to continue to take immediate steps, including at the UN Security Council and G7, to de-escalate and facilitate an immediate, lasting ceasefire in the region.     “Since the horrific October 7 attack, I have repeatedly urged an end to the violence through de-escalation, ceasefire, and diplomacy and cautioned that war is never the answer. Instead, the U.S. government has shamefully and unconditionally armed the Israeli government as it has committed war crimes, killed over 33,000 Palestinians, inflicted famine in Gaza, violated domestic and international laws, and increased the chances of regional war. This failed approach must end.  “The people of our country do not want war. They want to live in a world that is safe, peaceful, and just. That is why our pro-peace, pro-humanity movement is stronger than ever, and it’s why, as recently as last week, dozens of my colleagues and I called for our government to stop arming Netanyahu’s maniacal, genocidal acts. We are pushing for the safety of all people, from Palestinians and Israelis abroad to Jewish, Arab, Muslim, and other communities who are being targeted here at home, to the release of all hostages and those arbitrarily detained, and ending the risk of a regional war that further entangles the United States and jeopardizes the safety of our people. We cannot let the warmongers win; our country and our world are calling for restraint, de-escalation, a lasting ceasefire, and diplomacy. Our government must listen. That is how we save lives.” On April 1, 2024, the Israeli government bombed an Iranian embassy complex in Damascus, Syria, killing 16 people. In retaliation, the Iranian military launched an attack on Israel using drones and missiles on April 13. Since October 7, 2023, over 33,000 Palestinians and 1,100 Israelis have been killed, 76,000 Palestinians have been injured, dozens of hostages have been killed, and over 100 Israelis and thousands of Palestinians remain unlawfully detained.  ###"
April 15,Michael R. Turner,R,Ohio-10,Turner Hosts Awards Ceremony for 2024 Congressional Art Competition,"Today, Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman (NJ-12) introduced the Gig Is Up Act, which would push companies to treat gig workers fairly.  The bill would require companies with at least $100 million in revenues, and that employ at least 10,000 independent contractors, to pay for both the employer’s and the worker’s payroll tax contributions to Social Security and Medicare. Under the current system, the gig worker must pay for both. This new requirement for large companies would create an incentive to accurately classify these workers as employees, instead of forcing workers to shoulder the entire burden. “These people work hard. They generate millions of dollars in value for large tech companies, but they’ve been denied the basic benefits afforded to traditional employees,” said Rep. Watson Coleman. “Wealthy corporations have abused the system and these workers, who often struggle to support their families. ‘Honest work for fair pay.’ That’s the deal. This legislation ensures corporations hold up their end of the bargain.” “It's shameful that companies continue to misclassify their workers to avoid providing them with essential benefits,” said Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib (MI-12) “We must close the legal loopholes that allow massive companies to continue these exploitative practices. That's why I'm so proud to join Congresswoman Watson Coleman in support of this critical legislation.” “For too long, large companies and multinational corporations have taken advantage of workers based on their classification as independent contractors,"" said Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky (IL-09). ""Today we say the gig is up! I am proud to join my friend and colleague Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman in introducing the Gig Is Up Act to ensure that companies prioritize people over profits by paying workers fair compensation and providing the benefits that they have earned."" ""Every employee in this country deserves a living wage and sufficient benefits for themselves and their families,” said Rep. Shri Thanedar (MI-13). “Currently, millions of gig workers like ride-share drivers, food delivery workers, and more are being taken advantage of by their corporate employers. By finally forcing billionaire CEOs to pay their fair share, every worker can get what they deserve!"" ""Big companies like Uber and Lyft keep profits to themselves by misclassifying their workers, shirking all responsibility for benefits and decent wages in favor of precarious gig work,” said AFT President Randi Weingarten. “This is a targeted and malicious practice that leaves workers shouldering what should be a large corporation’s obligation to contribute their share of payroll taxes to Social Security and Medicare. The Gig Is Up Act confronts this injustice by pushing these companies to treat their workers as employees, with all the rights and respect that affords them. American families can’t build a decent life by cobbling together gig work — it’s time for big employers to pay their fair share."" “NEA is proud to endorse the Gig Is Up Act which would rightfully place the responsibility for payroll taxes on the multimillion dollar corporations not their gig workers. It’s unconscionable that the gig workers who have made these companies successful are responsible for paying the corporation’s share of payroll taxes,” said Marc Egan, Director of Government Relations at the National Education Association. “It’s time for these corporations to step up and treat their workers who are essential to their existence with respect.” ""Social Security Works is proud to support the Gig Is Up Act. This legislation takes much-needed steps to hold corporations accountable for exploiting their workers by misclassifying them as independent contractors,” said Executive Director Alex Lawson. “By requiring these corporations to pay their fair share into Social Security and Medicare, the Gig Is Up Act ensures that workers will receive their earned benefits. Thank you Rep. Watson Coleman for fighting for working people!"" “Large tech corporations like Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash have been chasing profit by paying dangerously low wages, denying people a meaningful voice in their working conditions, and shirking their responsibility for paying into social insurance funds that contribute to the safety and well-being of the working people they depend upon— workers who are disproportionately immigrants and people of color,” said Laura Padin, Director of Work Structures at National Employment Law Project (NELP). “NELP applauds Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman for reintroducing the Gig Is Up Act and requiring large corporations to contribute to Social Security and Medicare for the working people who are essential to their businesses.” “Congress should pass the Gig Is Up Act to ensure Medicare and Social Security benefits are adequately funded by large employers who retain gig economy workers,” said Trudy Goldberg, chair of the National Jobs for All Network. “It’s shocking and unacceptable that large companies are currently allowed to misclassify workers and evade their ethical responsibility to provide the adequate retirement and medical benefits that all workers deserve.” The Gig Is up Act is cosponsored by Representatives Eleanor Holmes Norton (DC-At Large), Rashida Tlaib (MI-12), André Carson (IN-07), Jan Schakowsky (IL-09), Jamaal Bowman (NY-16), Shri Thanedar (MI-13), Jahana Hayes (CT-05), Barbara Lee (CA-12), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (NY-14), Summer Lee (PA-12), Delia Ramirez (IL-03), and Robert Menendez, Jr. (NJ-08). It is supported by: Social Security Works, Transport Workers Union of America, Communication Workers of America, American Federation of Teachers, National Education Association, People’s Action, National Employment Law Project, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, National Jobs for All Network, Progressive Change Campaign Committee.

April 12,Shelley Moore Capito,R,W.Va.,"Capito, Manchin Urge U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to Fully Implement Jessie’s LawRead More","Washington, D.C. – Today, Rep. Mike Levin (CA-49) released the following statement calling on House Speaker Mike Johnson to immediately bring H.R. 529, the Extending Limits of U.S. Customs Waters Act, to the House floor for a vote. Last year, Rep. Levin met with CBP’s Air and Marine Operations (AMO) to learn about agents’ work to secure our maritime borders and hear directly about how he can support that work. During the discussion, AMO agents highlighted the importance of extending U.S. customs waters and shared how it will help them carry out their mission. “Recent incidents of unidentified vessels landing onshore in our district have underscored the urgency of bringing H.R. 529 to the House floor for a vote. This bill would double the range in which Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents can operate to address migrants and other vessels arriving by water along our coast. It would extend U.S. customs waters from 12 to 24 nautical miles, providing CBP with additional support to accomplish its duties, including interdicting drugs and addressing issues with migration, effectively and efficiently. “Last month, I voted in favor of a government funding package that will increase resources to CBP and provide the agency with updated tools and enforcement mechanisms, but there’s still more we must do to address our broken immigration system and support law enforcement officials. “Last week, Speaker Johnson was unable to bring H.R. 529 to the House floor as originally planned because of chaos within the House Republican Conference. He needs to stop playing games and Republican politicians need to stop with the political theater. If Speaker Johnson and the Republican Party care about solving our immigration crisis, stopping the flow of illegal fentanyl, and securing our borders like they claim, then they must bring this bill to the floor immediately. We need bipartisan, pragmatic solutions. This is one of them. I look forward to voting in favor of this bill.” ###"

April 15,Sherrod Brown,D,Ohio,Brown Announces Restoration of Nearly 530 Pensions for the Teamsters Local 73 Pension Plan,"WASHINGTON, DC – Congresswoman Barbara Lee (CA-12) and Tri-Caucus Leaders Reps. Steven Horsford (NV-4), Judy Chu (CA-28), and Nanette Barragán (CA-44) led a letter Friday with over 40 House Democrats to the Small Business Administration urging Administrator Guzman to publish a complete version of federal contracting spending data broken down by race and ethnicity. The administration published this kind of data for the first time in December 2021, but the data released in January 2024 for FY2021 and FY2022 has thus far been limited to the top five agencies. The lawmakers, who lead the Congressional Black Caucus, Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, underscored the economic impact federal contracting dollars can have on minority-owned small businesses and communities of color.  “We urge the SBA to completely deliver on its 2021 commitment to publish data, disaggregated by race and ethnicity, on government contracts issued to Small Disadvantaged Businesses for every federal agency, not just the top five,” the lawmakers wrote. “We ask that you publish this data for Fiscal Years 2021, 2022 and 2023 before April 30, 2024.” They continued, “In fiscal year 2020, the federal government spent more than $665 billion on contracts. But minority-owned businesses often struggle to win federal contracts, depriving those companies and communities of billions of dollars in opportunities. According to one study, had minority-owned businesses received FY20 federal contracting dollars in proportion to their share of the US business sector, they would have received $64 billion more in federal contracts. Black-owned businesses specifically would have received an additional $4 billion in contract awards and Hispanic-owned businesses almost $24 billion more.” “In 2021, President Biden committed to addressing this inequity through increasing federal contracting with Small Disadvantaged Businesses to 15% in FY25. Under your leadership, SBA has affirmed that the SBA Scorecard will reflect those milestones. As members of Congress, we write to remind your administration of this commitment and reiterate that publishing this data for all federal agencies will help legislators to understand the needs of America’s 33.2 million small businesses while fostering greater economic opportunity for marginalized groups.” Disaggregated data on race and ethnicity would show how these federal contracting awards for small businesses are being divided across racial and ethnic categories — Black and African American, Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander, Hispanic and Latino, Native American, and other minority-owned small businesses – to monitor equity and progress at a time when transparency is key to understanding the disparities faced by minority-owned small businesses.

There is only one way to effectively support our allies, protect U.S. troops, and save innocent lives: put this supplemental up for an immediate vote.“We are out of time.

April 15,Tim Kaine,D,Va.,Warner & Kaine Announce Over $3 Million in Federal Funding to Strengthen Water Infrastructure During Emergencies in Leesburg,"WASHINGTON, DC - Today, Congressman David Rouzer (R-NC), Congressman David Valadao (R-CA), Congressman Jim Costa (D-CA), and Congresswoman Elissa Slotkin (D-MI) announced the launch of the bipartisan Congressional Specialty Crops Caucus.   The caucus aims to highlight the issues facing the specialty crop industry and advocate for policies to allow U.S. specialty growers, processors, and partners to succeed by providing American families with a safe, affordable, and nutritious food supply. “North Carolina produces more than ninety commodities, providing fresh produce and ornamentals to consumers around the world,"" said Congressman Rouzer.  ""The unique challenges faced by the specialty crop industry deserve to be heard when debating farm policy in Congress.  The Specialty Crops Caucus will help enhance this industry’s voice to better ensure these issues can be properly addressed."" “With inflation, competition, and the Farm Bill ahead of us, it is important to have the priorities of specialty crops recognized,” said Lee Kimball, partner and sales director at Somerfield Farms in Wilmington, North Carolina. “We appreciate the leadership of Rep. Rouzer and look forward to working with him and the Congressional Specialty Crops Caucus to ensure our priorities are protected and we can continue the important work of helping feed the country.”  Specialty crops include fruits and tree nuts, vegetables, horticulture, herbs, nursery crops, and other ornamentals such as Christmas trees and floriculture.  Specialty crops account for more than one-third of farm gate value, represent 2.2 million jobs across all 50 states, and contributed $120.6 billion in labor income to the American economy last year.  The caucus will collaborate on legislation to support specialty crop producers and address issues such as market access, research funding, and sustainability measures. “Specialty crop producers have faced many challenges over the last few years,” said Congressman Valadao. “From supply chain backlogs at our ports, rising input costs, labor shortages, and drought; our producers have continued to supply the world with fresh, nutritious food despite these obstacles. Specialty crops are a cornerstone of California agriculture, and we need to ensure these producers are supported at the federal level. I’m excited to be co-chairing the Specialty Crops Caucus to ensure our specialty crop producers have a seat at the table in Washington.”  “California is the leading producer of specialty crops, with over 400 different crops. Any Farm Bill must include strong, bipartisan support for specialty crops,” said Costa. This caucus will continue advocating for policies that allow Specialty Crop growers to continue providing American families with safe, healthy foods.” “Here in Michigan, specialty crops – from cherries, to asparagus, to beans – are our bread and butter, and the reason that we’re America’s most agriculturally diverse state with reliable access to water,” said Slotkin. “It’s critical that we protect and support the next generation of farmers – including small farmers. That is why I’m joining my colleagues to launch the bipartisan Congressional Specialty Crops Caucus. This is a group that will look out for the farmers that are often lost in the agriculture conversation in Washington, and make sure they’re represented on every page of the Farm Bill.”  Click here for more information on the Specialty Crops Caucus and to sign up for updates."

April 13,Deb Fischer,R,Neb.,Fischer Statement on the Death of Ceresco Police Officer Ross Bartlett,"On Sunday night, Congressman Salud Carbajal joined a bipartisan group of 91 Members of Congress imploring Speaker of the House Mike Johnson to allow a vote on the bipartisan national security funding package, which passed the Senate in February, in order to provide critical aid to Ukraine and Israel as well as deliver much-needed humanitarian aid to Palestinian civilians in Gaza. “The inaction of the House on this aid package is unacceptable, now more than ever. In the past week, we have seen Israel come under direct attack by Iran, using the defensive weapon systems that this aid package supports to prevent further loss of life. We have seen worsening conditions in Gaza increase the already desperate need for Congress to approve humanitarian aid. And our lack of additional support for Ukraine has given Vladimir Putin renewed cause to believe we have turned our back on the Ukrainian people,” said Rep. Carbajal. “I commend the President’s continued efforts to stand with our allies and partners and to prevent wider wars around the world, but President Biden’s diplomatic efforts alone cannot meet our national security challenges. The House must be allowed the chance to debate and vote on this critical aid package, which has languished for too long after enjoying widespread bipartisan support in the Senate.” In the wake of Iran’s direct attack on Israel this past weekend and increasingly perilous conditions in Gaza and Ukraine, Rep. Carbajal and his colleagues called for a vote as soon as Monday evening. “Time is of the essence,” the members wrote. “We urge you to put the Senate Supplemental Aid package on the floor for an immediate vote when we return on Monday. This aid package passed the Senate with 70 votes, Democrats and Republicans, and we can send it to the President’s desk for signature Monday night.” The full letter can be found here. As a Vice Chair of the New Democrat Coalition, Rep. Carbajal has been a leader in pushing for Congressional action on President Biden’s supplemental request for security and humanitarian aid in support of Israel, Ukraine, and Taiwan, as well as humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians in Gaza and funding to help address immigration backlogs and security challenges at the U.S. southern border. Rep. Carbajal has been pushing for consideration of this bill since February, emphasizing its potential to save lives in the short and long term. He has also been pushing the Biden Administration to help scale up efforts to deliver life-saving aid to Palestinian civilians in Gaza, seek the renewal of a humanitarian ceasefire, secure the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas, and emphasize to Israel the need for a strategy that protects civilian life. In addition, Rep. Carbajal has voiced concerns to President Biden over Israel’s military operational strategies, and signed a resolution calling for a renewal of a humanitarian ceasefire that had previously helped facilitate safe delivery of humanitarian aid and the release of hostages being held by Hamas.

April 15,Deb Fischer,R,Neb.,Fischer Leads Colleagues in Urging Continued Support for Essential Air Service Program,"Congressman Salud Carbajal (CA-24) thanked President Biden for approving California Governor Gavin Newsom’s request for a major disaster declaration, which will unlock additional federal storm aid for Central Coast communities impacted by recent winters storms, flooding, and other extreme weather. “I am grateful to President Biden and his administration for recognizing the severity of the storms that the Central Coast faced this winter and approving our request for additional federal support,” said Rep. Carbajal. “My team and I will work with our federal, state, and local partners to ensure these additional resources can be used to perform the repairs needed to fully repair our region.” On Saturday, President Biden approved the federal disaster declaration for San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Ventura, and six other California counties to unlock Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funding for repairing damages from storms, flooding, landslides, mudslides, and tornadoes that occurred between January 31 and February 9, 2024 in Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Ventura and other select California counties. Rep. Carbajal had personally urged President Biden to approve the request for additional federal support in a letter sent three weeks ago. In his letter, Rep. Carbajal detailed the damage seen across the Central Coast: “In the City of San Luis Obispo, the storm caused severe damage to eight steel firehouse rollup bay doors. In Santa Barbara County, the County experienced severe cold temperatures, snow in higher elevations, flooding, among other extreme weather. At the San Marcos Pass, Santa Barbara County rainfall gauges measured nine inches of rain and four inches of rain in the City of Santa Barbara within a 24-hour period. This prompted Santa Barbara County to issue a flash flood warning. Additionally, Mission Canyon and Mission Creek experienced severe erosion, causing retaining walls to collapse. In Ventura County, residents also experienced extensive flooding. This led to serious damage to our roadways, bridges, and other water infrastructure. Mudslides blocked State Route 33 in the Los Padres National Forest.” The major disaster declaration unlocks Public Assistance from FEMA for state, local, and tribal governments to support debris removal, emergency protective measures, and other emergency infrastructure and work measures on the Central Coast and elsewhere in California.  Rep. Carbajal helped petition the Biden Administration to unlock federal aid for communities impacted by repeated atmospheric rivers and extreme weather last winter.

WASHINGTON – Today, Representatives David G. Valadao (R-CA), Jim Costa (D-CA), David Rouzer (R-NC), and Elissa Slotkin (D-MI) announced the reestablishment of the bipartisan Congressional Specialty Crops Caucus. The caucus is dedicated to highlighting the issues facing the specialty crop industry and building support for policies that allow U.S. specialty growers, processors, and partners to prosper by providing American families with safe, affordable, and nutritious foods. “Specialty crop producers have faced many challenges over the last few years,” said Congressman Valadao. “From supply chain backlogs at our ports, rising input costs, labor shortages, and drought; our producers have continued to supply the world with fresh, nutritious food despite these obstacles. Specialty crops are a cornerstone of California agriculture, and we need to ensure these producers are supported at the federal level. I’m excited to be co-chairing the Specialty Crops Caucus to ensure our specialty crop producers have a seat at the table in Washington.”  “California is the leading producer of specialty crops, with over 400 different crops. Any Farm Bill must include strong, bipartisan support for specialty crops,” said Congressman Costa. “This caucus will continue advocating for policies that allow Specialty Crop growers to continue providing American families with safe, healthy foods.” Specialty crops include fruits and vegetables, tree nuts, dried fruits, horticulture, and nursery crops. Critical to our nation’s food security, diverse agricultural landscape, and economy, specialty crops account for more than one-third of farm gate value, represent 2.2 million jobs across all 50 states, and contributed $120.6 billion in labor income to the American economy last year. The caucus will work to introduce and support legislation that benefits specialty crop producers and address issues such as market access, research funding, and sustainability measures. “North Carolina produces more than ninety commodities, providing fresh produce and ornamentals to consumers around the world.  The unique challenges faced by the specialty crop industry deserve to be heard when debating farm policy in Congress.  The Specialty Crops Caucus will help enhance this industry’s voice to better ensure these issues can be properly addressed,” said Congressman Rouzer.  “Here in Michigan, specialty crops – from cherries, to asparagus, to beans – are our bread and butter, and the reason that we’re America’s most agriculturally diverse state with reliable access to water,” said Congresswoman Slotkin. “It’s critical that we protect and support the next generation of farmers – including small farmers. That is why I’m joining my colleagues to launch the bipartisan Congressional Specialty Crops Caucus. This is a group that will look out for the farmers that are often lost in the agriculture conversation in Washington, and make sure they’re represented on every page of the Farm Bill.”  In recent years, Congress has worked on a bipartisan basis to combat unreasonable specialty crop trade barriers, increase access to automation technology, and help producers break into niche American markets. The Specialty Crop Caucus is dedicated to building on this foundation and supporting the interests of specialty crop production. Specialty crop producers in California are applauding the co-chairs for their leadership in Congress to raise awareness about the significant contributions and unique needs of the industry.  “The establishment of the Congressional Specialty Crop Caucus means we will have allies in Washington who understand our issues and the needs for a strong agriculture economy,” said Jeff Huckaby, the president and CEO of Grimmway in Bakersfield, California. “We are thrilled that Rep. Valadao has stepped up on behalf of specialty crops, and we look forward to working with him to ensure progress for our industry and the agriculture industry.”  "
April 15,Bob Casey,D,Pa.,"Amidst Caregiving Crisis, Casey, Kaine, Baldwin Introduce Bill to Revitalize Nation’s Long-Term Care Workforce","Washington, D.C. – Today, Chairman Jodey Arrington (TX-19) introduced the Estate Tax Rate Reduction Act, which would cut the estate tax in half and provide tax relief to family-owned businesses. Currently, the estate tax – commonly known as the “Death Tax” – is the highest tax rate in the U.S. Tax Code at 40 percent.  “The Death Tax is an unfair double tax that could force the next generation to sell their family business - on which they’ve paid a lifetime of taxes - to pay another tax simply because of a family member’s passing. Penalizing Americans who work their entire lives, build successful businesses, and seek to pass down a better life to their children and grandchildren is the antithesis of the American Dream,” said Arrington. “I am proud to introduce legislation to cut this punishing and unnecessary financial burden.” The Estate Tax Rate Reduction Act would reduce the U.S. estate tax from 40 percent to 20 percent, reducing the tax burden on family-owned businesses and allowing business owners to invest more of their hard-earned money in expanding their operations and creating jobs. ### Subscribe to receive the latest news, insights, and updates directly to your inbox."
April 15,Tammy Baldwin,D,Wis.,"Baldwin, Manchin, Brown Lead Effort to Close Tax Loophole and Make Private Equity Pay Their Fair Share","WASHINGTON, D.C. – On Monday, U.S. Congressmen Mike Waltz (FL-06) and Darren Soto (FL-09) introduced the bipartisan, bicameral Jackie Robinson Ballpark Commemorative Site Act to honor the location where Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier and played his first professional game. Under this legislation, the Jackie Robinson Ballpark and home the Daytona Tortugas, would be designated as a National Commemorative Site and direct the Secretary of Interior to conduct a feasibility study to give the site the designation of National Historic Landmark. U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (FL-R) will introduce companion legislation in the Senate. The bill is co-sponsored by the entire Florida House delegation and has the support from both Major and Minor League Baseball. “Jackie Robinson changed the course of history forever on March 17, 1946 in Daytona Beach when he set foot in the then-named Daytona City Island Ballpark,” said Waltz. “Since that day, Daytona Beach’s ballpark has been a historic landmark and reminder of Jackie Robinson, the Civil Rights Movement, and the integration of modern professional baseball. We must preserve and honor Jackie Robinson’s legacy and the impact he had in Daytona Beach and across America. That is why I am proud to introduce this bill in Congress on Jackie Robinson Day with fellow Floridian Senator Rubio to protect and commemorate the Jackie Robinson Ballpark in Daytona Beach so it may live on for generations to come.” “I am thrilled to introduce this bill, honoring Jackie Robinson's legacy by designating the Daytona Beach ballpark as a National Commemorative Site. It's a vital step towards preserving his historic contributions,” said Soto. “Jackie Robinson's legacy is a beacon of courage, resilience, and equality. His groundbreaking journey through adversity not only transformed the game of baseball but ignited a movement for social change that continues to inspire generations worldwide.""
 “Jackie Robinson wasn’t just a phenomenal baseball player; he was a trailblazer who broke barriers both on and off the field,"" said Senator Rubio. ""In 1946, he played at the Daytona City Island Ballpark, where his courage transformed not only the sport, but also our nation. I’m introducing the Jackie Robinson Ballpark Commemorative Site Act to honor and protect the site where Jackie played his first game and to remind us of the strength and impact one person can have on the world.” “Jackie Robinson’s journey in professional baseball, where he became an American icon, started in Daytona in the ballpark which now bears his name, and it is appropriate that this location be recognized in this manner,” said Greg Rosenbaum, Chairman of Minor League Baseball’s Government Relations Committee. “Minor League Baseball is proud to have one of our most historic ballparks designated as a National Commemorative Site, and we appreciate the bipartisan support that made this piece of legislation possible.”  “We are extremely honored to be entrusted with further stewarding the legacy of Jackie Robinson in Daytona Beach,” said Bob Fregolle, Co-owner & Operating Partner of the Daytona Tortugas. “This designation is greatly appreciated by the community here and will only strengthen his legacy for generations to come.” 244 Cannon House Office Building

April 15,Charles E. Grassley,R,Iowa,"Capitol Hill Report, 04-15-24","Finalized rule includes abortion in its definition of “pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions,” after Congressman Nadler led 82 House Democrats in a letter to the EEOC urging its inclusion   Rule also expands leave for prenatal appointments and recovery from childbirth as accommodations for millions who lack any right to time off under the FMLA 
Today, Congressman Jerrold Nadler (NY-12) issued the following statement in response to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's (EEOC) finalized rule implementing the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA):   ""I fought for years to get the PWFA across the finish line, and now, employers across our country have clarity on their responsibility to accommodate pregnant workers to ensure the PWFA fulfills its purpose of forming a workforce that supports pregnancy, childbirth, and other related conditions,"" said Congressman Nadler. ""I'm particularly grateful the EEOC's interpretation of the law explicitly includes abortion in its definition of “pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions,” consistent with longstanding interpretation of the same phrase in Title VII. Finally, women will no longer be forced to choose between their health and their paycheck.""   “The Democratic Women’s Caucus fought hard to pass the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act because no one should have to choose between her job and her pregnancy,” said DWC Chair Lois Frankel. “We are glad the Biden Administration and the EEOC issued these guidelines so workers know exactly what their rights are under this new law. No matter what, pregnant workers should be able to access the accommodations they need—including time off to manage miscarriages and get abortion care.”   ""This is a major step forward for the reproductive freedom and fair treatment of pregnant workers across the country, whatever the outcome of their pregnancy,"" said Congressional Pro-Choice Caucus Co-Chairs Diana DeGette (CO-01) and Barbara Lee (CA-12). ""No workplace has the right to discriminate against their employee for obtaining an abortion. Across the country, many pregnant workers are already grappling with the chaos and confusion of accessing abortion care in post-Dobbs America, without having to worry about threats to their employment or hostility in their work environment. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) was right to include abortion explicitly in its final regulation as they move to implement critical protections for pregnant workers, and the Pro-Choice Caucus is proud to fight alongside the EEOC and the entire Biden Administration to protect the rights and safety of every abortion patient.""   “Today’s Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) announcement is a major win for pregnant workers and families across the country,” said Rep. Judy Chu. “Since its enactment in June last year, the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act has become a critical lifeline for thousands of pregnant workers, and today’s final regulations provide essential clarity about their right to access to reasonable, life-saving accommodations at work. This law is a critical solution in addressing our nation’s maternal health crisis, and I’m especially thrilled that these final regulations protect access to unpaid leave in cases of miscarriage, stillbirth, and getting an abortion. With today’s announcement, pregnant workers will finally have the peace of mind that they can stay on the job, provide for their families, and get the accommodations they need to maintain their health and the health of their pregnancy.” A Better Balance Co-President Dina Bakst said, “We applaud the EEOC for issuing robust final regulations that appropriately recognize the broad scope of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act and ensure millions of workers, especially women in low-wage and physically-demanding jobs, can access the vital accommodations they need during pregnancy and after childbirth, to protect their health and keep their jobs. We are especially pleased to see leave for prenatal appointments and recovery from childbirth appropriately recognized as reasonable accommodations, benefiting millions of workers who currently lack any right to job-protected time off under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Today with these final rules, we have achieved a huge step forward for women’s economic security, maternal health, and the economy as a whole. The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is a life-changing protection for pregnant and postpartum workers nationwide, ensuring they aren’t forced off the job or denied the accommodations they need for their health. A Better Balance spent a decade making the legal case for the PWFA, grounded in the lived experience of thousands of workers nationwide, and are so pleased to see the EEOC has heeded our call for strong regulations to best protect them. Robust enforcement of this groundbreaking civil rights law will ensure workers with limitations stemming from pregnancy, childbirth, or other related conditions can fully rely on the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act’s protections, and have vital clarity as to how the law operates in practice, delivering long overdue dignity, fairness, and equality under the law.  We look forward to continuing to empower workers around the country to use their rights under the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, and to work with the EEOC to ensure strong enforcement.”  Vania Leveille, Senior Legislative Counsel, Liberty Division, American Civil Liberties Union, said, “We applaud the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for providing important guidance to workers, employers, and the courts so that the full force of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act can be given effect. We thank Representative Jerry Nadler for his leadership in getting this law across the finish line and for reiterating his support before the EEOC. The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, and the EEOC's regulations implementing it, are a critical step to protect the health and well-being of pregnant workers, particularly those from marginalized communities who are often overlooked."" Jocelyn C. Frye, President of the National Partnership for Women & Families, said, ""This is an important moment for pregnant workers, those with pregnancy difficulties or complications, and those who are considering having a baby. These workers can now rest assured that the EEOC will uphold their rights in the workplace, whether they need a break for water or to use the bathroom while on the clock, to adjust their working hours or some other accommodation. These rules further strengthen these protections for millions of workers, in spite of recent extreme partisan attempts to overturn this bipartisan law. Emily Martin, Chief Program Officer at the National Women’s Law Center (NWLC) said, “We applaud the EEOC for issuing strong regulations to implement the groundbreaking Pregnant Workers Fairness Act These regulations will help ensure that pregnant workers have meaningful access to accommodations and employers can no longer use pregnancy as an excuse to push workers out of their jobs. These regulations will help ensure that no one has to choose between their jobs and their health or the health of their pregnancies. We are also gratified that despite attempts by anti-abortion extremists to play politics with our lives, the EEOC remained true to the law and followed long-standing precedent that prohibits discrimination against workers who decide to have an abortion. This comprehensive rule will help pregnant workers maintain their health and economic security at a time when they face escalating attacks on their rights.”    Read the finalized rule here.

April 15,David Rouzer,R,N.C.-7,"Rouzer, Valadao, Costa, Slotkin Launch Bipartisan Specialty Crops Caucus","U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Congresswoman Chellie Pingree (D-Maine) today sent a letter to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs Denis McDonough requesting information about the implementation of “produce prescription” initiatives at the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). In 2022, President Biden called on VHA to begin the implementation of “produce prescriptions,” which allow patients who have diet-related chronic health conditions to be “prescribed” vouchers to purchase free or discounted fruits and vegetables. While the program is being piloted at VHA facilities in Houston and Salt Lake City, Congress needs more information about the program in order to understand how to best support the health and well-being of veterans across the United States, and potentially expand the program to more patients.  In their letter, the lawmakers requested an update on the produce prescription programming, noting that veterans have higher rates of illness as compared to other Americans. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 19 percent of veterans have diabetes and 12 percent of veterans have heart disease compared to 16 percent and 12 percent of all Americans, respectively. “We are writing to request an update on the Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) efforts to implement ‘produce prescription’ initiatives within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA),” the lawmakers wrote.  “Veterans often suffer from higher rates of illness compared to the general population, in part because of the stress and trauma that veterans too often have experienced,” the lawmakers wrote. “VA research has found that there is a need for dietary interventions for the health management of veterans with chronic conditions. At the same time, veterans are at a higher risk for food insecurity than the general population, but are less likely to be enrolled in SNAP benefits. As such, it is essential to ensure that veterans have the support needed to address their chronic health conditions, including strategies to address access to healthy, affordable food.” The lawmakers noted that Congress approved $2 million in federal funding for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to implement prescription produce initiatives within VHA.   In closing their letter, the lawmakers asked for additional information about how VHA has utilized the $2 million that Congress appropriated and about how it plans to scale the current produce prescription initiatives using the funds that Congress appropriated to serve more veterans across the nation.  “There are now two ‘produce prescription’ initiatives at VHA facilities in Houston, Texas, and Salt Lake City, Utah. Does VA plan to expand ‘produce prescriptions’ initiatives to other VHA facilities across the United States?” the lawmakers asked in their letter.  “Please explain in detail the resources, funding, or legislative authorities that the VA would require to expand ‘produce prescription’ initiatives to other VHA facilities across the United States, including any barriers to doing so,” the lawmakers requested as they concluded the letter.  Low fruit and vegetable consumption contributes to the fact that more than 50 percent of Americans have a diet-related chronic condition, such as heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. Veterans experience disproportionately higher rates of chronic disease compared to non-veterans, and 24 percent of veterans report being food insecure, which harms the ability to control their chronic diseases.   Initiatives that support veterans in obtaining fresh produce can improve health outcomes. According to the American Heart Association (AHA), adults who participate in produce prescription programs consume 30 percent more fruits and vegetables a day. In this research, AHA found that all participants in produce prescription programs experienced a measurable decrease in blood pressure and blood sugar.  A copy of the letter is available here and below. Pingree is a longtime organic farmer and serves on both the House Agriculture Committee, House Appropriations Subcommittees on Agriculture; Military Construction and Veterans Affairs; and Interior and Environment. She cofounded the bipartisan Food is Medicine Working Group.  +++ Dear Secretary McDonough,  We are writing to request an update on the Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) efforts to implement “produce prescription” initiatives within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).   Nearly 60 percent of Americans have a diet-related chronic health condition, such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes.  These conditions claim the lives of more than half a million Americans on an annual basis.  In addition, these conditions take a significant economic toll.  Diabetes alone accounts for $327 billion in annual health care expenditures in the United States.  Veterans often suffer from higher rates of illness compared to the general population, in part because of the stress and trauma that veterans too often have experienced. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 70 percent of veterans are obese compared to 60 percent of all Americans, 19 percent of veterans have diabetes compared to 16 percent of all Americans, and 12 percent of veterans have heart disease compared to seven percent of all Americans.  VA research has found that there is a need for dietary interventions for the health management of veterans with chronic conditions.  At the same time, veterans are at a higher risk for food insecurity than the general population, but are less likely to be enrolled in SNAP benefits.  As such, it is essential to ensure that veterans have the support needed to address their chronic health conditions, including strategies to address access to healthy, affordable food. As part of the White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health, President Biden called for “prescription produce” initiatives to be implemented within the VHA.  Congress provided $2 million for the VA to do through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 (P.L. 117-328).  We appreciate that the VHA has worked with the Rockefeller Foundation to establish two “produce prescription” initiatives within VHA facilities in Houston, Texas, and Salt Lake City, Utah.  However, we want to understand how the VHA plans to scale such “produce prescription” initiatives across the United States to reach the millions of other veterans who could benefit from these initiatives.  We support the VA’s work to improve the health and well-being of veterans and believe that “produce prescription” initiatives may have the potential to support veterans while reducing health care expenditures through the VHA.  To help us better understand how Congress can support these efforts, we request that you respond to the following questions by May 13, 2024. As part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023(P.L. 117-328), Congress provided $2 million for VA “to provide guidance and resources for VA facilities to develop local [produce prescription] program and pursue strategies for patient education and outreach.”  On April 25, 2023, VA announced that it would partner with the Rockefeller Foundation to expand access to “produce prescription” initiatives within the VHA.  How has the VA used the $2 million appropriated by Congress in FY23?

If the VA has not used the $2 million for this MOU with the Rockefeller Foundation, how has the VA used these funds?

If the VA has not used the $2 million for this MOU with the Rockefeller Foundation, with what funds, if any, did the VA use for this initiative?

There are now two “produce prescription” initiatives at VHA facilities in Houston, Texas, and Salt Lake City, Utah.  Does VA plan to expand “produce prescriptions” initiatives to other VHA facilities across the United States using the funds that Congress appropriated?  

If so, when?

If not, why?

Please explain in detail the resources, funding, or legislative authorities that the VA would require to expand “produce prescription” initiatives to other VHA facilities across the United States using the funds that Congress appropriated, including any barriers to doing so.

We understand that the VA’s financial policies state that the VHA can purchase food or refreshments when part of “the provision of medical treatment to VA beneficiaries under 38 U.S.C. § 7301(b), e.g.,in-patient meals.”  Please explain in detail the VA’s interpretation of this rule as it relates to “produce prescriptions,” including whether or not it must be amended in order to expand “produce prescriptions” to reach other veterans across the United States.

Sincerely,

April 13,Lori Trahan,D,Mass.-3,Trahan Statement on Iran Drone Attack on Israel,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Representative Pramila Jayapal (WA-07) released the following statement marking one year since the start of war in Sudan: “The people of Sudan have been suffering for far too long. For decades, brutal military dictatorships have denied the Sudanese people their basic human rights. And since the onset of the current conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) more than 12,000 people have been killed, 6 million have been internally displaced, 1.5 million have fled the country as refugees, and human rights groups have documented extremely high rates of sexual violence against women and girls in the region. Estimates also forecast that as many as 250,000 children and pregnant women could die of malnutrition in the coming months and only 30 percent of hospitals in Sudan are functioning. “In 2019, the Sudanese people inspired the entire world when they rose up and demanded an end to the dictatorship of President Omar al Bashir and a transition to democracy. In 2020, I had the opportunity to visit Sudan as part of a Congressional Delegation to meet with the new President in a celebratory moment. I met many of the leaders of the peaceful nonviolent movement, and seeing their courage and resilience continued to give me hope. It breaks my heart to see the country plunged back into chaos and widespread suffering. Too many of the Sudanese people have been displaced from their homes, and face not only the violence and cruelty of war, but also critical shortages of food, water, medicine, and electricity. “I have been in close touch with the U.S. Special Envoy for Sudan, Tom Perriello, and I appreciate his hard work towards a resolution to this horrific conflict. I urge the White House to utilize every tool in its toolbox — including sanctions for those involved in furthering this violence — to push for successful peace talks that implement the Sudanese people’s vision of civilian democracy and towards funding immediate humanitarian assistance from all our global partners. I am also working hard to ensure that all Americans understand the human consequences of what is happening in Sudan and become engaged in protecting innocent Sudanese civilians. We cannot turn a blind eye to the loss of life and suffering of the Sudanese people and their clear desire for a constitutional transition.” More than 1,800 people with Sudanese roots live in Washington State, greatly affecting many in Jayapal’s district. Below are some of their personal notes on the violence occurring in Sudan: “The war in Sudan has endured for one year too long, inflicting immense suffering upon the country and its people.  The impact of the war is very personal to me. My family has been displaced and they had to seek safety and refuge in other countries. It is devastating for my parents to leave their family, their home and everything they worked for all their life. More than 25 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance. This is by far the world’s largest displacement crisis and no one is paying attention,” said Mubarak Elamin, Washington State Sudanese Community Leader. “The war in Sudan is something that I never fathomed would occur, at least not to the extent that it has become. Like many others,  my family has been displaced, many of them who are elders, and are required to start over again. All that I have now are my childhood memories of summer vacations in Khartoum, in Burri and I’m still in shock that going back isn’t an option,” said Duha Mohamed, Washington State Sudanese Community Leader. “The war has inflicted trauma upon millions of people across Sudan. Many have depleted through the little savings that they had and are unable to find work due to the war. Those in the diaspora are now emotionally and financially stressed from having to care of their relatives in Sudan while worrying about their safety,” said Ahmed Salih, Graduate Student, University of Washington. “Beyond the headlines are very real stories that for those who are removed from the situation may forget, especially in a time where it seems like death and calamities have become all too regular. However, for people like me, they aren’t just headlines but have very real impacts on our very being. The recent massacres in various towns in El Gezira by the RSF have left many in my own family dead. While I am geographically far from the situation, my heart is still painfully affected by the senseless violence inflicted upon relatives and family friends,” Mo Ibrahim, MBA Student, Seattle University.

April 14,Ann McLane Kuster,D,N.H.-2,New Democrat Coalition Leadership Implores Speaker Johnson to Put Essential National Security Package on the House Floor this Week,"Reports indicate that the United States Senate is poised to abandon – or quickly table – its Constitutional duty of holding a trial for the now impeached Secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas.  This is a flagrant abuse of constitutional order and precedents of its own body.  And it comes against the backdrop of the House’s grueling work to adhere to our rules and hold the Biden Administration accountable for its refusal to comply with immigration laws passed by Congress.  I was one of the few House Republicans to vote to keep the impeachment procedures within the committee process and in keeping with regular order – a process that House Republicans doubled down on earlier this Congress.  It’s now time for the Senate to do its job and hold a full trial of Secretary Mayorkas – anything less would be a dereliction of duty ironically in line with the violations of Mayorkas himself.  When I voted to keep the impeachment process of Mayorkas with the committee of jurisdiction, I stated then that shortcuts couldn’t be an option if there was any hope of the Senate following our lead and holding Mayorkas accountable via impeachment. I also stated that we shouldn’t be taking a page out of the Democrat playbook by holding a “snap” impeachment akin to what the Democrats did to President Trump in 2021.  I certainly took potshots from elements of my party for doing so at the time, but I vote methodically and according to the rule of law and what is right morally.   While process and that vote gave rise to misguided political animus that was levied at me and other Republicans who voted to allow the House Homeland Security Committee to finish its investigation, it produced a stronger set of impeachment articles with even sharper teeth – which I was both proud to cosponsor and vote in favor of. We did our job by the book, refused to cut corners, and set novel precedent while doing so. In the end, I’m proud that my fellow House Republicans came to my position and committed to doing the hard work of a full impeachment inquiry, investigation, the committee process, and the successful impeachment of Secretary Mayorkas.  The Senate must respect the nearly year-long, five-phased investigation by the House Homeland Security Committee and the duly passed articles of impeachment.  The charges were of utmost consequence and were brought to avert a Constitutional crisis.  Mayorkas refused to comply with the laws passed by Congress and breaching the public trust by lying to Congress about the security of the border and the actions he took.  Actions like specifically directing through written memoranda that DHS employees violate immigration laws.   Think about the chaos that has engulfed not only the southern border, but also the entire nation under Secretary Mayorkas’ watch. According to data from Customs and Border Protection (CBP), more than 7.2 million illegal aliens have been encountered at the southwest border since President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas took office. There have been north of 1.8 million known “gotaways” that have evaded CBP and escaped into the United States. Since Fiscal Year 2021, more than 300 individuals on the terrorist watchlist have attempted to cross the nation’s southern border illegally. Sadly, the list goes on and on.  If the Executive Branch won’t enforce the laws we pass, Congress has few options of recourse. We could refuse to fund Mayorkas and his department, but in what way would this further border security?  Truly, impeachment is the only option left standing.  The Senate must face these facts.  It mustn’t run from our oral arguments, the review of evidence, and debate.  It must hold a full trial and do its duty as opposed to putting its head in the sand. The fabric of our Constitution – the separation of powers – might very well be at stake. I call on the Senate to fulfill its constitutional duty by holding a full trial for these impeachment articles and hold the Biden Administration accountable for its abuse of the rule of law. The American people are watching.

April 15,David Valadao,R,Calif.-22,"Valadao, Costa, Rouzer, and Slotkin Launch Bipartisan Specialty Crops Caucus","WASHINGTON – U.S. Representative Pramila Jayapal (WA-07), Ranking Member of the Immigration Integrity, Security, and Enforcement Subcommittee, is leading 47 Members of Congress in calling on Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to provide answers on the troubling treatment of individuals held in immigration detention facilities. Recent reports have detailed serious problems related to the performance of unnecessary medical procedures and the misuse of solitary confinement. “We have a responsibility to treat all human beings with dignity and fairness,” wrote the Members. “All facilities operated by or in connection with the United States government, funded by taxpayers should reflect that. These recent reports indicate that we are falling far short of our obligations. We urge the administration to take these reports and their recommendations seriously.” The United Nations has determined that solitary confinement lasting over 15 days constitutes torture. However, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and its subcontractors regularly detain individuals in solitary confinement for longer periods. Reporting shows that between 2018-2023, more than 14,000 individuals were held in solitary confinement for an average of 27 days, 682 for at least three months, and 42 for over a year.  In addition to extensive stints of solitary confinement, which has been proven to result in long-lasting physical and mental harm, the DHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) has also published reports indicating serious concerns with medical procedures at immigration detention facilities. According to DHS OIG, between 2019 and 2021, at least 25 percent of surgeries performed at facilities run by ICE and its subcontractors were not properly approved, therefore ICE cannot confirm whether they were even medically necessary. Specifically, the Members are calling on DHS to provide answers to how they will ensure ongoing compliance with stated policies in all immigration detention facilities, to share the status of implementation for recommendations to phase out the use of solitary confinement, and to share whether ICE plans to advise the President of recommendations for reform. Jayapal has been an active leader on the issue of increasing accountability at immigration detention centers and phasing out the use of solitary confinement. She recently led 50 Members in calling for increased transparency over detention centers that had been recommended for closure, has called for accountability in the death of a detained person at the Northwest Detention Center who died after 1,418 total days of solitary confinement, and was a leader in ensuring accountability for more than a dozen immigrant women who underwent forced, unnecessary medical procedures at the now-closed Irwin Country Detention Center. She also leads the Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act, which would work to reduce our overreliance on detention, end the use of detention for profit, end inhumane conditions at detention centers, and protect the civil and human rights of immigrants.

Republicans attacked the program that Democrats included in Public Law 113-235. The goal in that law was to help the Marianas and other insular areas transition to cheaper, clean energy and expand our use of renewables like wind and solar. These sources of energy are abundant in our islands in comparison to the expensive, foreign-sourced fossil fuel Republicans prefer we use, which is why many constituents ask me for earmarks that fund alternative energy projects. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle do not seem to understand the severe energy challenges we face in island communities: we are not connect to larger electrical grids, we have increased susceptibility to natural disasters and climate change impacts, and our fossil fuel generators are outdated and inefficient—all of which makes electricity around two and a half times more expensive than in the states. During questioning, I stressed to the Republican witnesses their error in attacking a program geared to drive down the price of electricity in the Marianas where everyone Welcome to the on-line office for Congressman Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan.

April 15,Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan,D,Northern Marianas Islands,Legal Services stops by,"502 Cannon HOB, Washington, DC 20515Email Me(202) 225-6435 The Tidal Basin in Washington, DC, home of the Thomas Jefferson, the Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorials, is encircled by scenic cherry trees. Each spring the trees bloom in a picturesque display, drawing visitors from around the world. This popular tourist attraction is the result of a gift of more than 3,000 trees presented to the United States by the government of Japan. Likewise, in Western Nebraska we share a special connection with the Japanese people as we await the grand opening of the Japanese Hall and History Center at the Legacy of the Plains Museum. This week, the United States welcomed Japan’s Prime Minister, Fumio Kishida, to Washington, DC. Our relationship with Japan is absolutely vital, especially considering the country’s regional proximity to foreign powers who pose an open threat to our democratic allies and are increasingly working together. Just this week as North Korea’s dictator Kim Jong Un intensified his typically combative rhetoric, China sent a senior diplomatic delegation to Pyongyang to demonstrate the close ties between their communist regimes. Additionally, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, published disturbing new evidence of ongoing exchanges of weapons and oil between Russia and North Korea. In his formal address to Congress, Prime Minister Kishida raised concerns about the aggressive postures of these nations, the risk of a Ukraine-like confrontation occurring in East Asia, and even the possibility of nuclear conflict. It is important to keep in mind, as our most powerful adversaries seek to undermine freedom and opportunity in any country they can, Japan’s location places it front and center in this struggle. Because of this, Japan has wisely increased their own defense spending. The Prime Minister thanked the United States for our unique historical impact and ongoing responsibility to stand for freedom. He was realistic about the fact our common values, such as a commitment to democracy and openness are not shared by rogue states. He called upon the U.S. to continue to demonstrate leadership among those who oppose authoritarianism on the international stage. These values are the keys to a prosperous future, yet we cannot achieve this kind of security without robust engagement on rules-based trade relations. Japan is an important market for U.S. agriculture products, especially high-quality Nebraska beef. However, President Biden’s abdication on trade matters has put both the U.S. and our allies at a competitive disadvantage. This is inexcusable, and it’s the reason I worked with my Ways and Means Committee colleague from West Virginia, Rep. Carol Miller, and others to introduce a bill this week calling for greater U.S. engagement with Indo-Pacific trade partners such as Japan. The saga of United States-Japan relations is storied and gripping. The development of a historic partnership between our countries in the decades following our opposition in the Second World War is a monumental triumph of restored goodwill and continues to stand as one of the most important alliances we have in the world today. At the opening of his address, Prime Minister Kishida announced Japan will gift an additional 250 cherry trees to Washington’s planned Tidal Basin renovation project in preparation for the coming celebration of 250 years of American independence. With endless opportunity on the horizon, there is great promise for the United States and Japan to strengthen our cooperation and friendship. ###"
April 15,Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan,D,Northern Marianas Islands,Talking disabilities," Washington, D.C. -- Congressman Paul A. Gosar, D.D.S. (AZ-09), issued the following statement after voting against H.R. 7888, the Reforming Intelligence and Securing America Act, legislation to reauthorize Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, for two years. “Congress purportedly wrote Section 702 of FISA to protect our national security by allowing the intelligence community, including the FBI, to spy on non-American threats without a court order.  However, FISA was never intended to spy on U.S. citizens.    Unfortunately, since its inception, the FBI and the federal intelligence community have abused FISA by collecting the communications of American citizens without a warrant, raising serious concerns about the indiscriminate and broad nature of the surveillance program and further infringing on the rights of Americans.   For example, the FBI has abused Section 702 to conduct warrantless searches against American citizens more than 278,000 times.  Several good amendments were offered to improve and reform FISA, including a commonsense amendment offered by my friend, Representative Biggs, that would have prevented warrantless searches of Americans.  Sadly, 86 Republicans and 126 Democrats inexcusably voted to allow the deep state to continue spying on Americans without a warrant by voting down this amendment.   As a result, I could not support the warrantless surveillance of Americans allowed under section 702 of FISA and voted against its reauthorization. It is a clear overreach of authority and is a direct violation of the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures.  While everything must be done to prevent future terrorist activities, it should not come at the cost of the privacy and civil rights abuses of innocent American citizens,” concluded Congressman Gosar.   ###"

Watch the full hearing here. “This budget is not only full of gimmicks that mask the true cost of protecting the Homeland, but it also fails to address the policy-driven crisis that continues at the border. For over three years we have seen skyrocketing illegal immigration at our borders. And every corner of the country can see and feel its impact,” said Congressman Joyce in his opening remarks. “This Administration’s approach to the border is just to manage the chaos – a position all fair-minded Americans reject. Decreasing detention capacity has not worked. Abusing the parole system has not worked. Catch and release has not worked. Executive orders that impede immigration enforcement have not worked.

David Trone Delivers Remarks at Press Conference Following Delegation Meeting on the Francis Scott Key Bridge Congressman David Trone (D-MD), a member of the House Appropriations Committee, delivered the following remarks at the press conference after a meeting with Maryland’s federal delegation, Department of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Governor Wes Moore, and more officials on the Francis Scott Key Bridge. On Friday, he affirmed (via statement) President Biden’s promise for the federal government to pay for 100% of the project and called on his Congressional colleagues to support. Congressman David Trone delivers remarks on April 9, 2024. Video here. “First of all, what’s most important to think about, again, as was mentioned, the six souls that lost their lives… [from] Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador… these are immigrants that are so often vilified throughout our country now.  “Yet, they’re often the greatest Americans, Americans who work the toughest jobs and the toughest hours of the day, with very little respect and compensation. So, we need to continue to honor them and realize their importance to our society. I want to also thank Governor Moore: his leadership on the ground, being there every day. He has been the quarterback. He’s been the go-to guy to get this partnership with the federal government executed. So he has just been a rock star in this effort.  “But at the same time, as I mentioned, as an appropriator, a bipartisan appropriator working with Congressman Harris, future appropriations chair Tom Cole. We’ve got to bring these dollars home in a positive way. But at the same time, the devil is in the details. And we’ve got to make sure we execute on President Biden’s promises. His promise to make sure that union labor builds this bridge. We need these projects to have Project Labor Agreements, so our union brothers and sisters can build the bridge the right way and on time. And we got to keep thinking about those that have lost wages: our longshoremen, our small businessmen, in the Port of Baltimore, 2.2 million dollars a day in lost wages. Guess what? Four hundred and thirty dollars a week unemployment ain’t going to cover it.  “The special fund by the state, [makes it] maybe six hundred hundred dollars a week. That’s not going to cover it. They still got mortgages to meet, food to put on the table, so we need an all of government effort not to just let that slip through the cracks and say, ‘oh, the Port’s open now again. It’s June 1, too bad.’ The government, the President made a commitment to all those there to make up on those lost wages, and we’ve got to come through on that, and that’s what this team will do. So thank you.”  Are you, or someone you know, struggling with a mental health or substance use disorder? You are not alone. Over the course of a year, we recently lost 100,000 sons, daughters, moms, and dads to drug overdoses. Millions are suffering from mental illness, exacerbated by the pandemic.

April 11,Kevin Cramer,R,N.D.,"National Park Service Awards $110,950 to North Dakota Communities","Today, U.S. Representative Matt Cartwright (PA-08) introduced a pair of bills to help ensure accountability and save taxpayers millions by addressing and preventing “zombie mines,” idled modern-era mines that have not been cleaned up by irresponsible coal companies. The Coal Cleanup Taxpayer Protection Act, co-led by Congresswoman Debbie Dingell (MI-06), will help ensure coal companies restore mine lands across the country to their original state after mining operations cease.   The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA) was supposed to ensure that mines would not be abandoned without sufficient funding available to clean up and reclaim them. Typically, these funds would be made available in the form of bonds provided by the mine operator as part of the initial permitting process. If the mine operator failed and did not restore a mine to usable land, the bond would be forfeited, providing the state with enough money to cover the cost of cleanup.  However, loopholes within SMCRA have allowed too many mine operators to fail to put down bonds equal to cleanup costs. This means coal mine operators have been able to avoid responsibility and costs required for cleaning up their mines once those mines are closed.  Cartwright’s Coal Cleanup Taxpayer Protection Act eliminates reckless self-bonding practices and requires operators to put down the full cost required for cleanup of their mines. Currently, self-bonding allows coal companies to promise to cover these cleanup costs without putting up sureties or collateral, leaving regulators with little to no recourse if a coal company goes bankrupt and forcing the American people to fund unfinished cleanup efforts. The bill also tightens rules on other types of bonding that have been shown to leave taxpayers paying for cleanup costs. “We’ve seen way too many coal companies file for bankruptcy and break their promise to clean up mine sites after they’ve made their profits, leaving the American people on the hook to foot the bill,” said Congressman Cartwright, a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee. “These idled and abandoned mines also prevent economic development and pose environmental dangers.” “If you build it, it should be your responsibility to take it down and clean it up,” said Congresswoman Dingell. “Non-operating, defunct mines continue to negatively impact our water, air and lakes, and it shouldn’t be on the taxpayer to foot the bill to clean up these sites. I’m glad to join Congressman Cartwright to introduce the Coal Cleanup Taxpayer Protection Act to put an end to this harmful practice.” This legislation is endorsed by the Alliance for Appalachia, Appalachian Citizens’ Law Center, Appalachian Voices, Citizens Coal Council, Earthjustice, Eastern Pennsylvania Coalition for Abandoned Mine Reclamation (EPCAMR), Friends of the Cheat, National Wildlife Federation, Powder River Basin Resource Council, Sierra Club, The Lands Council, Western Colorado Alliance for Community Action, Western Organization of Resource Councils (WORC), and the West Virginia Rivers Coalition. “The whole idea of self-bonding, as it stands today, is a loophole and a farce,” said Bob LeResche, board member of the Powder River Basin Resource Council and the Western Organization of Resource Councils. “We appreciate Congressman Cartwright’s efforts to   prepare for coal company bankruptcies and the permanent closure of coal mines by tightening the rules for self-bonding. Coal companies should not be allowed to offload mine cleanup costs onto taxpayers and states.” Full text of the bill can be found here.  Cartwright’s Bond Improvement and Reclamation Assurance Act, also introduced today, goes one step further in tackling bonding issues by requiring regulators to consider important financial and environmental factors when calculating and recalculating bond amounts, specifically:    ·  anticipated length of mine operations;    ·  inflation rates;    ·  long-term water pollution treatment needs;    ·  anticipated coal market conditions;    ·  the cost of reclamation if performed by the regulatory authority. This legislation is endorsed by the Alliance for Appalachia, Appalachian Citizens' Law Center (ACLC), Appalachian Voices, Powder River Basin, Sierra Club and Western Organization of Resource Councils (WORC). ""In the last few years in Kentucky, we've seen several mine permits abandoned by the coal operator with inadequate bond amounts,” said Rebecca Sheldon, director of Policy for the ACLC. “We’re so grateful for Congressman Cartwright's leadership in ensuring that mines have reclamation bonds that are sufficient to cover the costs of cleanup. Our regions deserve clean water and reclaimed land so that we can live safely and transition these sites into new opportunities."" ""We applaud Congressman Cartwright's dedication and leadership to ensure that coal mines are cleaned up, and to ensure that taxpayers aren't paying for coal mining reclamation,” said Chelsea Barnes, director of Government Affairs and Strategy for Appalachian Voices.  “Everyone deserves to have clean water and to be safe in their homes; the Congressman's bills are crucial measures to ensure coal companies aren't leaving mining communities to deal with their messes.""

April 11,Kevin Cramer,R,N.D.,"Sen. Cramer Discusses Passage of His Legislation to Overturn FHWA’s Illegal Emissions Rule, Green Energy Subsidies on Kudlow"," TUCSON, Ariz. – Today, the Biden administration issued the first-ever national, legally enforceable drinking water standard to protect communities from exposure to harmful per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), also known as ‘forever chemicals.  PFAS chemicals are estimated to potentially contaminate the drinking water of more than 200 million Americans, and the severe health impacts, including reproductive and developmental effects, are still not fully understood. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also announced nearly $1 billion in newly available funding through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, supported by Rep. Grijalva, to help states and territories implement PFAS testing and treatment at public water systems. Representative Raúl M. Grijalva (AZ-07) issued the following statement: “As a lifelong resident of the Tucson southside, my community is all too familiar with the toxic chemicals that polluted our drinking water and the adverse health impacts that followed. I’ve long called for enforceable standards to protect the public’s health and supply of drinking water, and today, President Biden delivered. This historic action will protect communities and provide enforcement to make certain that drinking water is safe around the country.” “While I appreciate the Biden administration’s commitment to investing in drinking water infrastructure upgrades, environmental justice, and our collective public health, it’s critical that public water systems across our nation work urgently to exceed the established timelines. We must continue to prioritize protecting Americans from these chemicals and it will require a sustained federal response. That’s why I am calling on Congress to make funding across appropriations bills to address PFAS a priority because everyone deserves access to clean air, water, and a healthy environment.” In 2021, Rep. Grijalva urged the EPA to implement more robust and rapid regulation of ​all PFAS chemicals in water sources across the country. He continues to support legislation, like the PFAS Action Act, to provide permanent protection​ for communities from toxic chemicals and immediate remediation for the thousands of contaminated sites found throughout our nation."
April 12,Kevin Cramer,R,N.D.,Bipartisan Legislation Seeks to Close Child Exploitation Loophole in Existing Federal Law,"TUCSON, Ariz. – Today, Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva (AZ-07) issued the following statement on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives’ final rule expanding required background checks before firearm sales. “The Biden administration’s finalized rule marks significant progress to help save lives and prevent guns from falling into the hands of dangerous individuals,” said Rep. Grijalva. “By closing this decades-old loophole, our communities will be safer from the scourge of gun violence. We must continue to push for common sense gun reforms like universal background checks and a national ban on assault weapons Now is time to build on our progress and have the political courage to protect the children of this nation – full stop.” Previously, only sellers “engaged in the business” of firearm dealing were required to register as a Federal firearm licensee (FFL) and therefore conduct background checks for firearm sales. Today’s rule expands the definition of “engaged in the business” of dealing firearms to anyone who sells firearms to earn a profit, greatly expanding the number of firearms dealers legally required to register as FFLs. Firearms sellers previously operating without running background checks will be obligated to perform them before selling a firearm to a buyer. This rule was made possible by the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the most consequential gun violence prevention legislation signed into law in decades which Rep. Grijalva was proud to help pass. More information on the Biden administration’s new rule is available here.  "
April 12,Kevin Cramer,R,N.D.,"Senator Cramer Condemns Overbearing, Costly Rule on American Oil and Gas","WASHINGTON – Today, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), announced $300 million in direct funding through the Shelter and Services Program (SSP), which was authorized by Congress to support communities that are providing services to asylum seekers. Arizona will receive $54.5 million in SSP funding in DHS’ first tranche of allocations. Rep. Grijalva and Stanton sent a letter on March 22, 2024 urging for the immediate allocation of funding and requested that border communities on the front lines of the crisis are prioritized. “I appreciate the Biden administration’s swiftness to allocate this federal funding to Arizona. I will continue to work with federal, state, local, and non-governmental organizations to ensure this funding is distributed expeditiously. As Southern Arizona communities continue to deal with the humanitarian crisis, it’s critical we provide them with the resources and funding they need,” said Rep. Grijalva. “It’s clear that the only path forward to address these issues long-term is real immigration reform to fix our broken system beginning with humane solutions, increased legal pathways, dealing with root causes, and providing more resources and personnel at the border instead of Republicans’ detrimental funding cuts and failed enforcement-only policies.” “This funding couldn’t come soon enough. I’ve visited local aid groups along the border, and they’re near a breaking point—over-stretching their budgets to help care for migrant families and prevent street releases,” said Rep. Stanton. “I’ll keep working to make sure Arizona communities get their fair share of federal resources to manage this crisis.” The full funding amounts for Arizona can be found here. Additionally, the Department is announcing $340.9 million through the Shelter and Services Program-Competitive grant program to be allocated before the end of this Fiscal Year as well as $25 million to accommodate evolving operational needs.  The recent government funding package passed in March 2024, provided $650 million for the SSP to reimburse local governments and non-profits for the care for migrants after their release into the U.S. – a decrease from $800 million last fiscal year. Previous GOP proposals would have eliminated the SSP funding entirely."
April 12,Kevin Cramer,R,N.D.,Letter Requests EPA Provide Nationwide Waiver for E15 Fuel Sales During 2024 Driving Season,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Rep. Rick Larsen (WA-02) applauded House passage of the Migratory Birds of the Americas Conservation Enhancements Act, a bipartisan bill introduced by Reps. Larsen, Maria Elvira Salazar (FL-27), David Joyce (OH-14) and Mary Peltola (AK-At Large) to reauthorize and improve the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act (NMBCA), the only federal grant initiative to promote the conservation of migratory birds. The bill passed the House of Representatives by voice vote. Senators Ben Cardin (D-MD) and John Boozman (R-AR) have introduced similar legislation, which the Senate is expected to consider soon. For video of Larsen’s remarks on the House floor in support of the bill, click here. What Larsen and Stakeholders Are Saying “I am glad to see our migratory bird bill soar through the House! Pesticide pollution, deforestation and invasive species threaten the more than 350 migratory bird species that rely on the Pacific Northwest as their flyaway,"" said Larsen, the lead Democrat on the Transportation & Infrastructure Committee. ""This bipartisan bill will help protect these diverse bird populations and their habitats in the Pacific Northwest and across the Western Hemisphere and provide a significant boost to the outdoor economy.” “We have lost three billion birds since 1970—a staggering number—and this legislation is critically important to help communities and partners meet the challenges of the moment so we can conserve migratory birds for years to come,” said Marshall Johnson, chief conservation officer at the National Audubon Society. “96 million Americans engage in birdwatching, contributing $100 billion to the U.S. economy each year. Investing in migratory bird conservation across the hemisphere is essential to reversing these troubling bird declines. We thank the House and the co-sponsors of this bill for their leadership, and urge swift passage of the companion bill in the Senate.” ""North Cascades Audubon Society wholeheartedly thanks Rep. Rick Larsen for his leadership and efforts to reauthorize and enhance the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act,” said Robert Kaye, conservation chair at the North Cascades Audubon Society. “This crucial legislation will help protect the neotropical migratory birds that perform such an essential role in the health and well-being of the ecological systems as they journey throughout our hemisphere. Additionally, so much of our forests, lakes, streams, wetlands and marine habitats that are essential to the health of our local ecosystems, and to the survival of these transient birds, will greatly benefit from the protections incorporated into this essential reauthorization legislation."" “As members of the Skagit Valley community, we understand the vital role that migratory birds play in our ecosystem and our economy,” said John Day, president of the Skagit Audubon Society. “Our valley is home to myriad migratory bird species that rely on the region's wetlands, forests, and farmland as critical stopover and nesting sites during their long journeys. Skagit Audubon Society greatly appreciates the leadership of Rep. Rick Larsen for passing this legislation to increase investments in protecting birds across the hemisphere, helping to ensure that birds have the habitat they need to thrive, no matter where they are on their migratory journey.” What the Migratory Bird Bill Does Since 2002, the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act has awarded more than $89 million in grants to over 700 migratory bird conservation projects in the United States, Canada, Central and South America, and the Caribbean. Partner organizations have contributed an additional $346 million to these projects, which have protected more than 5 million acres of habitat in the Western Hemisphere.

April 10,Susan Collins,R,Me.,"Senator Collins, Bipartisan Group Introduce Legislation to Improve Women’s Health Care in Rural Areas","The Congresswoman Worked Directly with Prince William County Officials to Help Construct a New Interchange to Alleviate Traffic Congestion & Improve Safety at Minnieville Road-Prince William Parkway Intersection **CLICK HERE for Photos of Spanberger & County Officials at Event** PRINCE WILLIAM COUNTY, Va. — U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger yesterday joined Prince William County officials and community leaders to celebrate the federal funding successfully secured for local projects as part of a U.S. House and U.S. Senate-passed fiscal year (FY)2024 appropriations bill. The major investment in this community-requested project totals $2.5 million that was signed into law and is now headed to the county. Spanberger worked directly with Prince William County leaders to solicit this request, move this project forward, and ensure it was included in the final package. This investment will help the county construct an interchange and additional improvements at the intersection of Minnieville Road and Prince William Parkway. “The Minnieville Road-Prince William Parkway Interchange Project will relieve some of the congestion that Northern Virginians are all too familiar with and help keep Virginians safe on the road. This $2.5 million federal investment in Prince William County will strengthen the county, invest in our local economy, and support local jobs,” said Spanberger. “With this funding, we are helping to meet the growing demands of this community and putting the pieces together to support this region’s continued growth and economic development — and I have been proud to work directly with county officials and community leaders to secure these federal dollars to help move this project across the finish line.” U.S. Senators Tim Kaine (D-VA) and Mark Warner (D-VA) also worked during the FY2024 appropriations process to make sure this funding for Prince William County was secured in the U.S. Senate-passed package and sent to the President’s desk to be signed into law. “I’m proud to have worked with local leaders in Prince William County and my colleagues in Congress to secure this $2.5 million to invest in roadway improvements, sidewalks, and updated trails,” said Kaine. “Supporting new, improved infrastructure is vital to keeping the people of Virginia safe and connecting our communities to work, school, and essential services.” “I was proud to vote to pass the FY24 government funding legislation and am thrilled to see $2.5 million in dedicated funding go towards making the intersection of Minnieville Road and Prince William Parkway safer and more accessible. I look forward to continuing to champion local projects that ensure folks can get where they need to go quickly and efficiently,” said Warner. Spanberger, Kaine, and Warner secured $2,500,000 for Prince William County to help construct a Single Point Urban Interchange (SPUI) at the intersection of Minnieville Road and Prince William Parkway. The project will help relieve congestion, improve safety, enhance access and connectivity, and support economic development plans in the region. This funding will also provide for the construction of sidewalk and trail segments to improve safety and increase access for pedestrians and bicyclists. BACKGROUND For FY2024, the U.S. House of Representatives allowed for specific Community Project Funding requests — as it did in FY2023. Spanberger worked directly with community leaders in localities across Virginia’s Seventh District to gather community-focused requests for her submissions. Click here for the full list of her submissions. The Community Project Funding process was created to ensure that Members of Congress — in concert with the communities they represent — may submit direct applications for federal funding to support locally planned projects as part of the yearly appropriations process. To be eligible, projects must be sponsored by local or state government entities or non-profit organizations and must be projects that would otherwise meet the qualifications to apply for federal grant funding. The purpose of Community Project Funding is to ensure direct, local engagement as part of the federal appropriations process. In line with this goal, funding applications needed to demonstrate significant local support for the projects. ### Congresswoman: “We Have Too Much Work to Do to Waste Time on Petty Political Games” WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger today released the following statement after voting against U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene’s (R-GA-14) effort to throw the U.S. House of Representatives into chaos. “Since January 2023, this dysfunctional House Republican majority has […] The Common Ground Scorecard Ranked the Congresswoman as Tied for Fourth Place for Most Bipartisan Elected Official in the Country WASHINGTON, D.C. — The nonpartisan Common Ground Committee (CGC) once again ranked U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger as the most bipartisan Member of Congress from Virginia — and gave her the fourth-highest score of any lawmakers in […] Since the Start of 2019, the Congresswoman’s Office Has Returned More Than $38 Million in Backlogged IRS Refunds, Social Security Checks, VA Benefits, & More WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger announced today that her office has now returned more than $38 million in federal casework funds to residents of Virginia’s Seventh District.

This funding is made possible through the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) and Federal Highway Administration’s Promoting Resilient Operations for Transformative, Efficient, and Cost-Saving Transportation (PROTECT) Grant Program — created by the bipartisan infrastructure law, which Spanberger helped negotiate and voted to pass. This award will allow Stafford County to realign a 0.45-mile portion of Brooke Road from Loblolly Lane to Maplewood Drive to relocate the road out of the floodplain. The project will address frequent flooding on portions of the road that become impassable for extended periods of time during heavy rainstorms, isolating more than 600 residents and restricting access to food, water, shelter, places of work, and emergency services. The roadway runs parallel to Accokeek Creek, a major tributary to the Potomac River. “Virginians deserve safe roads to drive on in their communities. The project to be funded by this more than $10 million federal grant will finally help relieve persistent flooding that keeps residents of Stafford County and those traveling through from getting where they need to go, getting what they need, and getting the emergency services they might depend on,” said Spanberger. “The bipartisan infrastructure law is continuing to deliver for Virginia’s communities — and I was proud to have a hand in crafting the bipartisan framework that led to this historic investment in our nation’s physical infrastructure needs.” “Stafford County is grateful to the Federal Highway Administration and Department of Transportation for the opportunity to be awarded the $10.2 million PROTECT Grant,” said Meg Bohmke, Chairwoman, Stafford County Board of Supervisors. “Once obtained, it will play a crucial role in addressing the persistent flooding issues at the ‘S’ curve on Brooke Road. It will also enable the County to implement a sustainable solution, ensuring the safety and accessibility of the residents living beyond that point.” BACKGROUND According to USDOT, the Promoting Resilient Operations for Transformative, Efficient, and Cost-Saving Transportation (PROTECT) Discretionary Grant Program was created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act — also known as the bipartisan infrastructure law— to provide funding to ensure surface transportation resilience to natural hazards including climate change, sea level rise, flooding, extreme weather events, and other natural disasters through support of planning activities, resilience improvements, community resilience and evacuation routes, and at-risk coastal infrastructure.

April 11,Richard Blumenthal,D,Conn.,"Blumenthal, Kiggans & Kim Lead Bipartisan, Bicameral Legislation to Expand Healthcare Options for Reservists & National Guardsmen","On Friday, April 5,Rep. Pete Aguilar and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra visited SAC Health – San Bernardino to highlight the investments made by Congress and the Biden-Harris Administration to make health care more affordable and equitable in the Inland Empire. Rep. Aguilar hosted a fireside chat with Secretary Becerra and CEO of SAC Health, Jason Lohr, to discuss the importance of federal funding in supporting better health outcomes for Latino residents in the region, followed by a press event celebrating the success of the Inflation Reduction Act in bringing down prescription drug costs. “It was a pleasure having Secretary Becerra in the Inland Empire to highlight the shared commitment of the Biden Administration and House Democrats to make health care more affordable for folks in our region,” said Rep. Pete Aguilar. “While we celebrate these victories, we must also acknowledge the challenges that lie ahead. Far too many hardworking residents pay too much for prescription drugs and access to basic medical care. I am committed to continue pushing to lower costs and improve health care access in the Inland Empire.” “Here in San Bernadino, and across the country, accessible, high-quality health care is being recognized as a right for all, and not just a privilege for the wealthy. Finally, more families than ever in California have the peace of mind that comes from knowing they have coverage,” said Xavier Becerra, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. “We are grateful for Congressman Aguilar’s ongoing commitment to support SAC Health and our ability to provide care to the community,” said Jason Lohr, CEO of SAC Health. “For over a decade, he has been a champion in helping secure over 85 million dollars of HHS grant funds that have supported SAC Health programs such as our medical mobile clinic, residency training through our Teaching Health Center funding, HIV care, and Medication Assisted Treatment clinic grants. As we actively expand our locations, access, and services, we look forward to his continued support that will allow us to provide quality healthcare to those who need it the most.” In 2022, Rep. Aguilar helped pass the Inflation Reduction Act, which capped the cost of insulin at $35/month for Medicare enrollees and lowered insurance premiums for those enrolled through the Affordable Care Act. Last year, Rep. Aguilar also helped deliver over $3 million in federal funding from HHS to SAC Health to support their operations and increase access to affordable care in the region. Additionally, in 2022, Rep. Aguilar secured $375,000 to help expand SAC Health’s Mobile Health Clinic program, which officially opened last year.

April 10,Lance Gooden,R,Tex.-5,RELEASE: Congressman Lance Gooden Demands Immediate Halt to $53 Million NYC Program Subsidizing Illegal Aliens,"WASHINGTON, DC—Congressman Paul D. Tonko (NY-20) today introduced his Cultural Resources Challenge Act, new legislation that would support and protect the nation’s cultural resources by empowering the National Park Service (NPS) to expand historic preservation efforts. Tonko’s legislation comes days after the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) released their Cultural Resources Challenge for the National Parks Service report, which called upon Congress to better support and fund NPS to restore and protect the nation’s resources. “Our national parks are powerful, awe-inspiring records of our rich heritage and history,” Congressman Tonko said. “Despite their vital historic and economic benefits, our cultural resources are continuously underfunded and facing dire threats through natural disasters and climate change. My Cultural Resources Challenge Act seeks to address these threats. By addressing staff shortages with the National Park Service, confronting the role of climate change, and improving resiliency and accessibility of cultural resources, my bill will help ensure our cultural resources can continue to connect individuals and communities with the stories of our shared past and inspire future generations.” “History is at the heart of our national parks, which protect pivotal stories of the Revolutionary War, the Civil Rights Movement, and countless other chapters of the ever-unfolding American narrative. National Park Service rangers work tirelessly to teach park visitors about our country’s diverse, complex cultural resources.” said Alan Spears, Senior Director of Cultural Resources for the National Parks Conservation Association. “But chronic underfunding means fewer talented National Park Service historians and other expert staff are left to tell those stories at parks every year. Funding shortfalls have left our history vulnerable to climate change-related disaster, with flood and fire threatening historic buildings, battlefields, and more. The National Parks Conservation Association proudly supports Congressman Tonko’s Cultural Resources Challenge Act, which would breathe new life into cultural resources management and preservation in our national parks. New funding would help the Park Service recruit more of the best and brightest cultural resources staff, as well as safeguard American history from climate change. This bill would help equip the Park Service to continue to serve as some of America’s greatest storytellers, and protect our American legacy for generations to come.” “This legislation recognizes the vital importance of safeguarding our shared cultural heritage in U.S. National Parks from the growing threat of accelerating climate change impacts, including coastal flooding, extreme heat and worsening wildfires. The Act would also strengthen the National Park Service’s ability to implement effective science-based strategies to ensure the parks’ irreplaceable cultural resources are more resilient to climate harms by involving local communities and integrating Indigenous Knowledge, expertise and oral history,” said Adam Markham, Deputy Director for Climate, Union of Concerned Scientists. Tonko has long been a champion in protecting and preserving America’s historic cultural sites and the stories they hold. He authored the National Heritage Areas Act, which became law in 2022 and established clear, transparent standards that make it easier for communities and local partnerships to develop and maintain their Heritage Areas.

April 11,Austin Scott,R,Ga.-8,Rep. Austin Scott Appointed to House Rules Committee,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Congressman Brad Finstad (MN-01) introduced the EPA Accountability to Farm Country Act, legislation that would require the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and farmer stakeholders to review rules and regulations proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that may impact the agricultural sector and provide recommendations on how to limit the impact. If EPA does not mitigate the effect of their proposed rule, it would be unable to be finalized. “American farmers are the best environmentalists in the world, and the EPA’s repeated failure to consider the impact of their regulatory agenda on agriculture has made clear that they are out-of-touch with farm country,” said Rep. Finstad. “Those who are directly impacted by EPA regulations – American farm families who work tirelessly to feed and fuel the world – deserve a seat at the table.” The EPA Accountability to Farm Country Act is endorsed by the American Farm Bureau Federation, National Corn Growers Association, National Pork Producers Council, Meat Institute, Agricultural Retailers Association, U.S. Beet Sugar Association, American Sugarbeet Growers Association, North American Blueberry Council, Minnesota Corn Growers Association, Minnesota Soybean Growers Association, and Minnesota Farm Bureau. “All too often, growers are left out of federal rulemaking efforts, even though those rules have major implications for farm families, agriculture, and rural communities. It is critical that farmers have a say in crafting rules and regulations that affect them, and Minnesota Corn Growers Association appreciates Congressman Finstad’s work to ensure that farmers are given that opportunity. Bills like the EPA Accountability to Farm Country Act sponsored by Congressman Finstad assure that farmers have a seat at the table so regulatory agencies fully understand the impact of their rules. Congressman Finstad has a long history of supporting farmers, and we are proud to endorse the EPA Accountability to Farm Country Act.” – Dana Allen-Tully, President, Minnesota Corn Growers Association “Farmers rely on a variety of products to maintain sustainable farming enterprises, and many of those products are approved and reviewed by the EPA. Agriculture needs a voice during these important conversations, and the Minnesota Farm Bureau applauds Congressman Finstad's leadership on this issue.”  – Dan Glessing, President of Minnesota Farm Bureau  Specifically, the EPA Accountability to Farm Country Act: Original cosponsors of the EPA Accountability to Farm Country Act include Representatives Dusty Johnson (R-SD-AL), Don Bacon (R-NE-02), Ashley Hinson (R-IA-02), Scott Franklin (R-FL-18), Derrick Van Orden (R-WI-03), Dan Newhouse (R-WA-04), Michelle Fischbach (R-MN-07), Austin Scott (R-GA-08), Roger Williams (R-TX-25), Mike Flood (R-NE-01), and Barry Moore (R-AL-02).

April 10,Abigail Spanberger,D,Va.-7,"Following Spanberger Push, Stafford County Awarded More Than $10 Million for Brooke Road Flood Mitigation & Resiliency Project","For Immediate Release WASHINGTON, DC – Today, Congressman Jamaal Bowman, Ed.D. (NY-16), along with 16 of his colleagues, introduced the  ACCESS In Mental Health Act.  To address the systemic issues in our nation’s mental health system, Congressman Bowman (NY-16) introduced the Advancing Culturally Competent and Equitable Supportive Services (ACCESS) in Mental Health Act. This bill would: Provide grants to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) including Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) to create, expand, or improve graduate programs in mental health fields. These fields include psychology, counseling, social work, psychiatry, school-based mental health professions, substance use disorder prevention and treatment, and more.  Provide grants of $10,000 per year to students pursuing graduate degrees in mental health fields at HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs to help cover the cost of attendance. “As an educator for 20 years, I saw firsthand how the lack of mental health professionals and culturally responsive care impacted my students and their families,” said Congressman Jamaal Bowman, Ed.D. (NY-16). “Not only do we need more mental health professionals in our communities and schools, but we need more Black and Brown mental health professionals who are equipped to provide culturally responsive and trauma-informed care. My ACCESS in Mental Health Act would work to rectify the lack of diversity in the mental health workforce by providing grants to HBCUs, TCUs, HSIs, MSIs, and their students, to create and expand programs and to support tuition costs. We’ve been facing a national mental health crisis over the last few years and Congress must begin to take action by strengthening our mental health workforce and investing in opportunities for young people from all communities to enter mental health fields.”   “As our country faces a mental health crisis, we must do everything in our power to address this issue head on,” said Congressman Tony Cárdenas. “The ACCESS in Mental Health Act does just that by investing in the buildup and diversification of our mental health workforce in order to provide more Americans with the access to culturally responsive health professionals and care.”  To read the bill summary click here.

Velázquez (NY-07), and Bonnie Watson Coleman (NJ-12) The ACCESS in Mental Health Act is endorsed by: American Psychological Association, American Federation of Teachers, Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, National Association of Social Workers, American Mental Health Counselors Association, National Association of School Psychologists, American Association of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, National Alliance on Mental Illness, Anxiety and Depression Association of America, American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, American Counseling Association, American Association for Psychoanalysis in Clinical Social Work, International OCD Foundation, Maternal Mental Health Leadership Alliance, and Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, and Young Invincibles. “The American Psychological Association strongly supports the ACCESS in Mental Health Act and applauds Representative Bowman for his leadership,” said Arthur C. Evans, Jr., PhD, CEO of the American Psychological Association. “The need for a diverse, representative, culturally and linguistically competent mental health workforce is necessary now, more than ever. The ACCESS in Mental Health Act will help make this a reality by building, strengthening, and supporting pathways to degrees in mental health fields within institutions of higher education that have historically educated predominantly students of color.”  “Too many of our students are struggling with their mental wellness, making it harder for them to do well in school, pursue their passions, and develop the skills they need in adulthood,” said Randi Weingarten, President of the American Federation of Teachers. “Whether it's cyberbullying and too much exposure to harmful accounts on social media, the isolation and loneliness from the pandemic, or the trauma from witnessing gun violence, the need for more robust mental health services in schools has gone dramatically unmet, particularly in under-resourced schools and communities. Schools should be able to provide more than just academic support, especially because often, schools are one of the only consistent places of safety for kids. Congressman Bowman's bill tackles this need head-on by increasing the number of mental health professionals available to work with students. It establishes and expands graduate programs so more folks can enter this profession, and it makes them more affordable too. Every day, AFT educators and healthcare professionals see the impact these challenges have on our next generation, so we know first-hand: it’s more important than ever to pass the ACCESS in Mental Health Act as soon as possible.” Permalink: https://bowman.house.gov/2024/4/rep-jamaal-bowman-introduces-the-access-in-mental-health-act-to-strengthen-mental-health-workforce

This legislation would establish guidelines for solar panel projects on prime and unique farmland funded by the United States Department of Agriculture. This will ensure that rural communities have a say in the approval process for solar panel projects, while still giving farmers the flexibility to utilize renewable energy on their operations. The SOLAR Act will also require that funding recipients have soil remediation plans in place and the funding secured to remove the solar panels upon project completion. “We are losing precious and productive farmland that is being used up, acre after acre,” said Bost. ""That has a big impact on America's agricultural supply chain, our food security, and our local economies. The worst part is, many local communities aren't allowed to have a say in what land is designated for solar projects. My legislation puts the power back into the hands of our local communities by allowing them to determine what's best for the area, not bureaucrats in Springfield.""   This legislation comes after Illinois became one of the first Midwest states to strip zoning authority from local governments in determining if solar panel projects were right for their communities in January 2023.  ### Permalink: https://bost.house.gov/2024/4/bost-introduces-bill-protecting-farm-land"
April 10,Jacky Rosen,D,Nev.,"Rosen, Lankford, Manning, Smith Introduce Comprehensive Bipartisan Bill to Take Historic Action to Counter Antisemitism in the U.S.","Washington, D.C. – In case you missed it, on Tuesday, Defense One reported that Congresswoman Elise Stefanik introduced a new bill Wednesday to accelerate the Defense Department’s use of quantum information science, from sensing and navigation to more ambitious goals of quantum computing for advanced artificial intelligence applications.  Read the full article below:  Defense One: New bill would greatly expand Defense Department quantum efforts By Patrick Tucker  Republican lawmakers will introduce a new bill Wednesday to accelerate the Defense Department’s use of quantum information science, from sensing and navigation to more ambitious goals of quantum computing for advanced artificial intelligence applications.  Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., and Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., will introduce the Defense Quantum Acceleration Act. The legislation would direct the Defense Department to establish a new quantum advisor role and stand up a center of excellence to “explore and identify  [quantum information science] technologies that have demonstrated value in advancing the priorities and missions of the Department,” according to the text of the bill, viewed exclusively by Defense One.  Quantum information science, which takes advantage of the unique properties of quantum mechanics, has many potential defense applications. Information that’s encrypted on the quantum level can’t be secretly intercepted because attempting to measure a quantum property changes it. Quantum sensors can relay information about location, making them a more secure means of navigation than GPS, which can be spoofed. Quantum computers, today in their infancy, could eventually process information exponentially more effectively than conventional computers. The National Academies of Sciences has said “quantum computers are the only known model for computing that could offer exponential speedup over today’s computers.” But China has outpaced the Defense Department in terms of investment in quantum technology, dedicating $15 billion over the next five years—or $3 billion a year—as opposed to the $700 million yearly Defense Department investment.  The new bill doesn’t push the Defense Department to match China’s numbers, as private companies like IBM, Google, and Lockheed Martin are also heavily spending research and development dollars on next-generation quantum computing. But it does raise the profile of quantum technology within the Defense Department and, theoretically, would allow the Pentagon to start buying more quantum technologies faster, enabling quicker innovation from private companies.  “Quantum’s impact on our national security will be considerable, and we must take immediate steps to ensure the United States is the first nation to reach quantum advantage. This bill will ensure the Department of Defense, led by the incredible work at [The U.S. Air Force Rome Laboratory in New York] is able to outpace our adversaries and rapidly develop and transition quantum technologies to our service members,” Stefanik said in a statement.  The Defense Department already has a director of quantum science in the office of the undersecretary for research and engineering. Under the bill, the newly-established quantum advisor would have a much-expanded role, coordinating with combatant commands on where they might need or use quantum science, coordinating with allies like Australia to share knowledge and best practices, and specifically looking at the challenges the Defense Department faces to determine if quantum information science might help.  The bill would also direct the stand-up of a center to coordinate with businesses and academia and develop prototypes of more near-term quantum technologies for sensing and navigation, in addition to accelerating quantum computing research. Chris Padilla, vice president of government and regulatory affairs at IBM, applauded the introduction of the act, which he said, “helps ensure the Department of Defense embraces this revolutionary technology. For national defense and economic security reasons, the United States must maintain a leadership position in quantum computing, and this legislation supports that effort. IBM encourages Congress to pass it and the administration to begin deploying quantum-centric supercomputing.” Permalink: https://stefanik.house.gov/2024/4/icymi-defense-one-new-bill-would-greatly-expand-defense-department-quantum-efforts 2211 Rayburn House Office Building Washington, DC 20515 Phone: (202) 225-4611 137 Margaret Street, Suite 100 Plattsburgh, NY 12901 Phone: (518) 561-2324 Fax: (518) 561-2408 330 Ford Street, Suite B8 Ogdensburg, NY 13669 Phone: (315) 541-2670 99 Troy Road, Suite 312 East Greenbush, NY 12061 Phone: (518) 242-4707 Phone: (315) 219-8005"
April 10,Jacky Rosen,D,Nev.,Rosen Helps Pass Bipartisan Bills Through Committee to Improve Border Inspections for Fentanyl Contraband,"Washington, D.C. - Today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik and Senator Marsha Blackburn introduced the Defense Quantum Acceleration Act, legislation that would supercharge the Department of Defense’s (DoD) approach to quantum technology and advance U.S. national security, building on the excellent work done by Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) - Rome, in Rome, New York. Currently, there are a number of tremendous individual efforts in quantum across the DoD, such as the quantum computing work being done by AFRL-Rome, but these efforts lack a unified effort and focus on transitioning quantum-enhanced capabilities to the warfighter on a relevant timeline.  This bill would establish a framework for the DoD to optimize its approach to the development and transitioning of quantum technology by empowering a Principal Quantum Advisor to the Secretary of Defense to develop a strategic quantum roadmap and provide an independent budget assessment of current DoD quantum budgets to Congress. The bill would also authorize a defense quantum technology testbed to enable the Defense Innovation Unit to successfully execute the transition of near-term quantum capabilities using the $55 million of funding it received for this purpose in Fiscal Year 2024. “I am proud to lead this critical legislation to ensure the United States maintains a quantum technological advantage over our adversaries, including Communist China,” said Representative Stefanik. “Quantum’s impact on our national security will be considerable and we must take immediate steps to ensure the United States is the first nation to reach quantum advantage. This bill will ensure the Department of Defense, led by the incredible work at Rome Labs, is able to outpace our adversaries and rapidly develop and transition quantum technologies to our service members.” “U.S. advancement of quantum technology is critical for our nation to compete on the global stage, as Communist China has made clear their goal to lead the world in this industry by 2049,” said Senator Blackburn. “This legislation helps ensure the Department of Defense maximizes its developmental resources and capitalizes on the incredible work happening at the local level, including in Chattanooga and Oak Ridge.” ""Congresswoman Stefanik's legislation is critical to our national and economic security, and I applaud her foresight in making applied quantum information sciences a priority for the Department of Defense. Much of the military's pathbreaking work in QIS is led by Rome Labs, whose open innovation? initiatives are performed in our world-leading laboratories at Innovare Advancement Center in Rome, NY, where we embed the national quantum workforce strategy into all of our research programs to develop the next generation of quantum scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs. Today, QIS technology is in the laboratory but tomorrow it will likely be in the battlespace. To prepare for this, the U.S. military must have a robust applied QIS R&D infrastructure and talent pipeline to ensure that we are transitioning advances rapidly from the laboratory to the warfighter. That's precisely what this bill is all about, and I thank Congresswoman Stefanik for introducing it,” said Heather Hage, President and CEO of the Griffiss Institute. “The Defense Quantum Acceleration Act signifies a critical commitment to leveraging quantum technology to its fullest potential, ensuring that the United States remains at the forefront of technological advancement and strategic defense capabilities. Congresswoman Stefanik is providing key leadership in bolstering America’s national defense industry and securing our nation as the global leader in quantum technology,” said Marc P. Christensen, P.E., Ph.D., President of Clarkson University. “Clarkson University is among our nation’s technological institutions advancing quantum capabilities with the Department of Defense through partnerships like the one we have with Rome Labs, as well as defense contractors on all facets of applied research and educating graduates ready to lead industry in advancing these technologies.” “IBM applauds Representative Stefanik and Senator Blackburn for introducing their Defense Quantum Acceleration Act, which helps ensure the Department of Defense embraces this revolutionary technology. For national defense and economic security reasons, the United States must maintain a leadership position in quantum computing, and this legislation supports that effort. IBM encourages Congress to pass it and the Administration to begin deploying quantum-centric supercomputing,” said Chris Padilla, Vice President of Government and Regulatory Affairs at IBM. “Quantum technologies, including computing, sensors, and networking, have the potential to revolutionize national security. The nation that leads in these areas will have a significant military advantage. The Quantum Industry Coalition applauds Rep. Stefanik and Sen. Blackburn for recognizing this, and for introducing the Defense Quantum Acceleration Act to help ensure that the United States will be the world quantum leader for years to come,” said Paul Stimers, Executive Director of the Quantum Industry Coalition. “The Defense Quantum Acceleration Act is landmark legislation. For the first time it makes sure the most important advances in quantum information science, from quantum computing and quantum sensing to the latest developments in quantum communication and hybrid technologies, become part of our national defense arsenal. At a time when our race for quantum supremacy against China is crucial to the security of America, the DQAA will empower the Department of Defense to find the applications of quantum technology that best serve its needs and requirements, today and far into the future,” said Arthur Herman Senior Fellow, Hudson Institute & Director, Quantum Alliance Initiative. “The field of quantum information science and its applications is a critical area of strategic competition for the United States, and one which the nation cannot afford to lose. Securing a quantum advantage for the warfighter will require a deliberate approach to cultivating these technologies,” said Heather Penney, Senior Fellow at the Air and Space Forces Association's Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies. “PsiQuantum’s mission is to build the world’s first useful quantum computer, and we are grateful for Rep. Stefanik and Sen. Blackburn’s continued leadership on quantum technologies,” said Jeremy O’Brien, CEO and Co-Founder of PsiQuantum. “Utility-scale, fault tolerant quantum computing will be a reality much sooner than conventionally predicted, and both Rep. Stefanik and Sen. Blackburn have understood this reality for years. The Defense Quantum Acceleration Act will ensure that the Department of Defense is prepared to capitalize on the unique ways in which fault tolerant quantum computing can help advance national security imperatives, in both the near- and long-term.” “Quantum information science – and quantum computing in particular – is absolutely crucial to our national and economic security. This bill showcases the U.S.’s strategic vision and leadership that is needed to drive quantum adoption for our nation’s defense and intelligence community,” said Peter Chapman, CEO and President of IonQ. “We believe the Defense Quantum Acceleration Act of 2024 and continued investments by the US Department of Defense in quantum will further accelerate the deployment of transformative computing solutions. We continue to take pride in IonQ’s role as a partner to the U.S. Department of Defense and are excited to support Congresswoman Stefanik and Senator Marsha Blackburn's strategic vision.”  ""We applaud Rep. Stefanik for introducing the Defense Quantum Acceleration Act, a policy that will provide a framework for the Department of Defense and its service branches to identify problems that could be addressed by quantum technologies,” said Dr. Alan Baratz, CEO of D-Wave. “Developing and accelerating adoption of quantum and quantum-hybrid applications is critical to achieving mission objectives such as challenges facing the modern battlefield and supply chain logistics. Quantum technologies are advancing at different rates and utilizing the most advanced systems will help achieve an edge in national security.”  ""Atom Computing commends Congresswoman Stefanik and Senator Blackburn for spearheading the ""Defense Quantum Acceleration Act"", empowering the Department of Defense to more effectively organize disparate initiatives and operationalize critical quantum technologies that could enable asymmetric competitive advantage for the warfighter. This legislation will give the Department a strategic role in accelerating utility-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing for our national security,"" said Rob Hays, CEO of Atom Computing. “As the world’s largest integrated quantum computing company, Quantinuum strongly supports the Defense Quantum Acceleration Act introduced by Representative Stefanik and Senator Blackburn. Quantum computing is rapidly advancing from the lab to the commercial marketplace and US leadership for this emerging technology will be crucial for economic and national security alike. We believe that the Defense Quantum Acceleration Act will supercharge the Department of Defense’s approach to quantum and drive crucial near-term use cases and workforce development across government and industry,” said Ryan McKenney, Director of Government Relations at Quantinuum.

April 11,Jacky Rosen,D,Nev.,"Rosen, Cortez Masto, Amodei Meet with USPS on Proposed Relocation of Processing Operations from Reno to Sacramento","Washington, D.C. - In case you missed it, National Review reported that Congresswoman Elise Stefanik sent a letter to the Harvard Corporation demanding Harvard University hold perpetrators of antisemitism accountable. Read the full article below:  National Review: Stefanik Blasts Harvard for Failure to Discipline Students Who Allegedly Assaulted Israeli Classmate By Zach Kessel Representative Elise Stefanik (R., N.Y.) sent a letter to Harvard University leadership on Thursday asking why the administration has yet to discipline anti-Israel campus protesters who allegedly accosted and assaulted an Israeli student. During an October 18 “die-in” demonstration intended to signal opposition to Israel’s retaliatory strikes against Hamas after the October 7 terrorist attack, multiple keffiyeh-clad protesters surrounded an Israeli first-year business student, grabbing, pushing, and yelling at him. Harvard has since engaged a law firm to conduct an independent investigation of the incident, and as Stefanik wrote in her letter, local prosecutors are currently in the process of scheduling court hearings for two of the assailants. On March 25, though, the victim’s legal representation “learned that the ‘Clerk’s Hearing’ in the criminal case has been postponed to May 7.” “One of the assailants in the incident, a Harvard Divinity School graduate student, is scheduled to graduate in May 2024. Due to this postponement, the assailant will gain the lifelong distinction of being an alumnus of Harvard despite having committed a well-documented antisemitic hate crime against a fellow student,” Stefanik wrote. The firm representing the victim, Holtzman Vogel, wrote a letter in March to the attorney Harvard retained to conduct its internal investigation asking why the probe had not progressed since it began. Noting that the university and its legal team had not notified them of any developments in the investigation and had not issued proper disciplinary action, the team of attorneys wrote that “the protracted delay all but ensures that at least one of the offending individuals will have the privilege of graduating from Harvard without facing any serious academic or professional consequences for his actions.” The lack of punishment, the attorneys wrote, sends a message that “Harvard students can harass and assault a Jewish individual on camera with impunity, advertise the attack on social media, and still receive a Harvard degree, scot-free.” Stefanik, reminding interim Harvard president Alan Garber and Harvard Corporation senior fellow Penny Pritzker of former president Claudine Gay’s performance at a December congressional hearing, wrote that this latest instance of the university’s refusal to discipline students, faculty, and staff for antisemitic behavior demonstrates a striking lack of accountability on the part of Harvard. “In front of Congress, when disgraced former Harvard President Claudine Gay failed to denounce antisemitism and calls for genocide, she also claimed ‘disciplinary processes are underway’ against perpetrators of antisemitism,” Stefanik wrote. “This has proven to be false, with Harvard producing no evidence of punishment against those who have committed crimes and violated Harvard’s code of conduct.” The New York congresswoman, referencing the sharp decrease in early applicants to Harvard since its post-October 7 wave of antisemitism began, wrote that “at a time when support and applications for Harvard have fallen, university leadership has continuously chosen to side with those who hate Jewish students and faculty and failed to keep them safe.” This particular instance is not the first time Harvard has seemingly stonewalled an investigation. House Education and Workforce Committee chairwoman Virginia Foxx (R., N.C.) announced in March that the university has not complied with a congressional subpoena ordering the administration to provide documents related to the committee’s investigation into Harvard’s handling of antisemitism on its campus. “Harvard’s continued failure to satisfy the Committee’s requests is unacceptable,” Foxx wrote at the time. “I will not tolerate delay and defiance of our investigation while Harvard’s Jewish students continue to endure the firestorm of antisemitism that has engulfed its campus.” Harvard assistant vice president for communications Jonathan Swain told National Review in a statement that the university is intent on fighting antisemitism on its campus. “Antisemitism has no place in the Harvard community,” Swain wrote. “We remain steadfast in our commitment to combating antisemitism, in whatever form it manifests itself and our ongoing efforts to ensure that Jewish students feel safe, valued, and embraced at Harvard.” Swain also wrote in his email to NR that the divinity student referenced in Stefanik’s letter “is not scheduled to graduate in May 2024.” Though Swain would not elaborate on that assertion, NR reviewed previous reporting identifying the student as Elon Tettey Tamaklo — based on an FBI report — and Tamaklo’s LinkedIn page, which indicates that he will in fact receive his degree in May 2024.

I will continue working to strengthen our country’s security partnership with Japan and support our brave service members, including many from Upstate New York and the North Country, as they proudly serve our country in the Pacific region.” In September 2023, Congresswoman Stefanik, a senior Member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) and House Armed Services Committee (HASC), led a bipartisan congressional delegation (CODEL) to the Indo-Pacific, including Japan, Singapore, and Thailand to meet with various government, military, and cultural leaders in the region to show the United States’ support amidst mounting aggression from Communist China. During the CODEL, Stefanik met with constituents from Clinton, Warren, Washington, and Montgomery counties who are bravely serving in our nation’s military.

During this event, an Israeli Harvard Business School student recorded the act and was quickly surrounded by a mob of antisemitic perpetrators who physically assaulted and harassed him. These assailants blocked his path, repeatedly grabbed him, and shouted “Shame! Shame! Shame!""  According to documents obtained by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, following this incident Harvard engaged the law firm of Jenner & Block to conduct an independent investigation of the incident. Jenner & Block met with the victims’ attorneys at the law firm Holtzman Vogel in early January 2024 and received relevant video evidence of the incident.   Further information shows that local prosecutors are currently in the process of negotiating court dates with two of the Harvard students who assaulted the victim. On March 25, Holtzman Vogel learned that the “Clerk’s Hearing” in the criminal case has been postponed to May 7. One of the assailants in the incident, an antisemitic Harvard Divinity School graduate student, is scheduled to graduate in May 2024. Due to this postponement, the assailant will gain the lifelong distinction of being an alumnus of Harvard despite having committed a well-documented antisemitic hate crime against a fellow student.  In the letter, Congresswoman Stefanik states, “Justice for this incident should have been served quickly, and the delay of justice that specifically allows an antisemitic student to graduate is an affront to accountability and demonstrates the cultural rot of Harvard University’s leadership that has allowed antisemitism to continue.” Read the full letter here.

I am proud to co-lead Chairman Luttrell’s legislation to ensure our veterans’ claims are processed and results are delivered with the urgency they deserve,” said Congresswoman Elise Stefanik. “Over the course of several hearings, I’ve heard time and again about the Veterans Affairs Board of Appeals failing to ensure quality decision making on veterans’ claims,” said Congressman Morgan Luttrell. “The legislation I introduced this week would ensure that the Veteran Affairs Board of Appeals provides veterans and their families with legally accurate and fair decisions on their claims for VA benefits. I will continue to hold the VA’s feet to the fire and do everything in my power to course correct this ship.” “Veterans and their families have earned legally accurate and fair decisions on their claims for VA benefits. But right now, that’s not always the case. As a result, veterans are stuck in limbo waiting years on end for their earned disability compensation benefits,” said Mike Bost (R-IL), Chairman of the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. “My friend and colleague, Rep. Luttrell, has introduced the Veterans Claims Quality Improvement Act, which would make vitally important improvements to the VA appeals process by implementing a robust quality assurance program so that veterans have a system at the VA Board of Veterans’ Appeals that they can trust. Rep. Luttrell and I know firsthand that we can’t take our foot off the gas when it comes to modernizing and pushing VA’s disability compensation benefits processes forward.” “I’m grateful for Chairman Luttrell’s leadership on this important bill that will help address the glaring performance problems routinely made when the VA Board of Veterans Appeals reviews Veterans’ benefit claims,” said Congressman Gus Bilirakis. “These errors unnecessarily delay our nation’s heroes from accessing the benefits they deserve and is a concern that has been raised by many of my constituents.

April 11,Beth Van Duyne,R,Tex.-24,Congresswoman Beth Van Duyne (TX-24) Hosts Elementary School Fly-In for Students and Parents to Experience Congress and our Nation's Capital,"Washington, D.C. - In case you missed it, today, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee, demanded that Director of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Lieutenant General Heath Collins use the $10 million Congresswoman Stefanik secured via the FY24 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to begin the planning and design of a third missile defense site at Fort Drum, the DoD’s preferred location for a third missile defense site. In the FY24 Consolidated Appropriations Act, Congresswoman Stefanik secured a $10M increase for the MDA to conduct planning and design for a third missile defense site at Fort Drum. In the FY24 NDAA, Congresswoman Stefanik led an effort to include report language that states this additional money should be used for “military construction planning and design activities needed to construct a missile defense interceptor site at Fort Drum, New York.” In 2019, the Department of Defense designated Fort Drum as the preferred location for an East Coast missile defense site. The United States’ missile defense architecture is currently aging and a third site would provide additional missile defense coverage to protect our homeland.  Watch her line of questioning here. Read a full transcript of her line of questioning below: Congresswoman Stefanik: “First I would like to correct the record. Earlier in this hearing, the ranking member said that the Department of Defense chose Fort Drum as the preferred missile defense site for the third homeland missile defense site nearly ten years ago. That is incorrect despite the fact that you said that’s correct. General Collins, you are aware that the date that that was designated was 2019, correct? Lieutenant General Heath Collins: “Yes, ma’am.” Congresswoman Stefanik: “So the ten years ago was incorrect.” Lieutenant General Collins: “Yes, ma’am. Four years ago.” Congresswoman Stefanik: “Great. You are also aware that just last year, General Milley and Vice Admiral Hill testified in front of this Committee that the construction of a third site at Fort Drum would be strategically worthwhile, correct? You’re aware of that testimony?” Lieutenant General Collins: “Yes, ma’am.” Congresswoman Stefanik: “And you’re also aware that in multiple NDAAs, the language designating Fort Drum as the preferred third site for East Coast missile defense site has been included in multiple NDAAs, you’re aware of that?”  Lieutenant General Collins: “Yes, ma’am.” Congresswoman Stefanik: “And just let the record reflect the Ranking Member voted in support of that language, not once but multiple times, as well as voted for Appropriations as did the majority of members of this Committee. Now, in the FY14 Appropriations Act and the NDAA, we worked to secure $10 million in planning and design funds for the Missile Defense Agency to begin construction activities for a third homeland missile defense site at Fort Drum. My question to you, General Collins, is: As the Director of MDA, can you confirm to me that this $10 million is being used at Fort Drum as dictated by Congress as explicitly stated by Congress at Fort Drum to begin the planning and design of a third missile defense site? ”  Lieutenant General Collins: “Ma’am, that $10 million has been authorized and appropriated for that purpose, and that’s the purpose we’re executing it for.” Congresswoman Stefanik: “And what are you using that for?” Lieutenant General Collins: “That is to do the initial planning and development of a design for continental interceptor site to take it to the 10 percent design level?” Congresswoman Stefanik: “At Fort Drum?” Lieutenant General Collins: “We are pursuing an agnostic design that would support–” Congresswoman Stefanik: “That’s not what the language said.” Lieutenant General Collins: “By doing it as an agnostic site, we would not slow down the capability to do it at Fort Drum.” Congresswoman Stefanik: “That’s not what the language that was passed by Congress said. And you understand that in the NDAA, for multiple years, it had designated Fort Drum. There were three sites under consideration in three different states. There was a process, an environmental impact study. This has been a very thorough process. And so you're saying to me today that the $10 million is not designated at Fort Drum for the planning and design?” Lieutenant General Collins: “It is. It supports a continental interceptor site at any location that's determined to be optimal in the future in line with the 2019 memo that the department signed out.”  Congresswoman Stefanik: “Designating Fort Drum.” Lieutenant General Collins: “Fort Drum, and it also designated that when a requirement was set for a continental site that there would have to be a readdress and a reassessment of location based on performance.” Congresswoman Stefanik: “Even though you said in my office when we met, General Collins, in my office, that you understood that the $10 million would go to the design and planning at Fort Drum, as specified by the NDAA.” Lieutenant General Collins: “When a decision, if a decision is made to pursue a Fort Drum site, the $10 million will be 100 percent in line with being able to accomplish that.” Congresswoman Stefanik: “But you do understand that multiple NDAAs Fort Drum has been designated, as well as by DoD.”   Lieutenant General Collins: “I’m aware, ma’am, of the report the Department signed out and the previous NDAAs.” Congresswoman Stefanik: “Okay, great. With that, I will yield back.” ### Permalink: https://stefanik.house.gov/2024/4/icymi-stefanik-holds-missile-defense-agency-accountable-to-use-10m-at-fort-drum-to-improve-homeland-missile-defense-as-congressionally-directed 2211 Rayburn House Office Building Washington, DC 20515 Phone: (202) 225-4611 137 Margaret Street, Suite 100 Plattsburgh, NY 12901 Phone: (518) 561-2324 Fax: (518) 561-2408 330 Ford Street, Suite B8 Ogdensburg, NY 13669 Phone: (315) 541-2670 99 Troy Road, Suite 312 East Greenbush, NY 12061 Phone: (518) 242-4707 Phone: (315) 219-8005"
April 10,Jamaal Bowman,D,N.Y.-16,Rep. Jamaal Bowman Introduces the ACCESS In Mental Health Act to Strengthen Mental Health Workforce,"Washington, D.C. – On Tuesday, the U.S. House of Representatives unanimously passed Congressman Darin LaHood's (IL-16) bill, H.R. 6233, the Community Reclamation Partnerships Act. H.R. 6233 would expand protections under existing law to third-party groups who participate in the cleaning and re-purposing of inactive coal mines, abandoned before modern regulations. Throughout the United States, there is over $12 billion worth of abandoned mine sites with no responsible party. The outstanding abandoned mine land (AML) liabilities, or the estimated cost of the earth work needed to complete the reclamation of all remaining AML sites, in Illinois is currently $163 million.  ""Mining is an important part of our economy, but unused or abandoned mines present safety risks and leave opportunities for economic and land development on the table,"" said Rep. LaHood. ""The Community Reclamation Partnerships Act will enable partnerships between states and nongovernmental entities to reclaim and restore land and water resources adversely affected by coal mining activities. I am proud this legislation passed the House unanimously, and urge the Senate to pass it swiftly."" “H.R. 6233 enables non-governmental organizations to remediate abandoned mine lands across the country while also easing the burden on the taxpayers. Representative LaHood has championed this bipartisan, commonsense bill through the committee, and I thank him for his efforts to pass it through the House,"" said House Natural Resources Chairman Bruce Westerman.  Background: Currently, states are responsible for these rehabilitation projects and receive funding from the AML Fund, supported by fees paid by coal operators. Given the project backlog and need in communities across the country, non-government organization have been encouraged and interested in contributing their time and resources to the effort, but are often deterred due to potential liability. To address this issue, under this bill, these entities would be recognized as “Community Reclaimers” and states would assume responsibility for all Community Reclaimer projects, just as they currently do for approved AML contractors. The legislation also sets up a process for recognizing agreements between states and federal agencies establishing approved practices at abandoned mine sites for Community Reclaimer projects. ###  Permalink: https://lahood.house.gov/2024/4/lahood-s-community-reclamation-partnerships-act-passes-house-unanimously 1424 Longworth HOB Washington, DC 20515 Phone: (202) 225-6201 Fax: (202) 225-9249 100 NE Monroe Street Room 100 Peoria, IL 61602 Phone: (309) 671-7027 Fax: (309) 671-7309 527 Colman Center Drive Rockford, IL 61108 Phone: (779) 238-4785 108 East Beaufort Street Normal, IL 61761 Phone: (309) 445-8080 1715 North Division Street Suite E Morris, IL 60450"

The U.S. Trade Leadership in the Indo-Pacific Act will reassert Congress’s authority over trade to combat China’s growing economic influence in the Indo-Pacific through renewed American efforts at re-engaging our allies and identifying opportunities for regional partnerships.  The U.S. has not concluded a single comprehensive trade agreement with an Indo-Pacific partner in more than 10 years.  Meanwhile, China has engaged our allies, actively pursuing trade agendas that block the U.S. from competing.  The United States is failing to promote a meaningful trade agenda in the region and could risk falling behind. Trade with our Indo-Pacific allies is critical as it supports millions of American jobs and represents several of our top export markets. A targeted U.S. International Trade Commission study will develop meaningful solutions to achieve U.S. objectives through a bipartisan Indo-Pacific Trade Strategy Commission, which will deliver recommendations on options that Congress can take to compete in the region.  Click here for bill text.   “The United States must not relinquish its lead on trade in the Indo-Pacific as the Chinese Communist Party seeks to exert their influence, both economically and militarily, in the region and around the globe.” said Congressman LaHood. “The bipartisan U.S. Trade Leadership in the Indo-Pacific Act reasserts the United States’ economic leadership in the Indo-Pacific and states unequivocally our interests for the benefit of farmers, and small and medium-sized enterprises nationwide. I am proud to join my colleagues in introducing this bipartisan legislation, which takes necessary steps in outlining a long-term economic strategy in the Indo-Pacific region.”   “The United States needs to step it up when it comes to its role in trade relations for the Indo-Pacific region,” said Congressman Panetta.  “The bipartisan U.S. Trade Leadership in the Indo-Pacific Act would establish a dedicated independent trade commission tasked with developing a comprehensive strategy to promote U.S. innovation, exports, and economic opportunities while countering the Chinese Communist Party’s aggressive trade policies.  This legislation would prompt America to work with our regional partners, strengthen our economies, and provide stewardship in an area of growing competition and immense opportunity.” ""Now more than ever, it is imperative that the United States has strong trade relationships in the Indo-Pacific. The Biden Administration’s inaction on trade has left gaping holes that the Chinese Communist Party is more than happy to fill, and Congress must step up. The U.S. Trade Leadership in the Indo-Pacific Act is just the first of many necessary steps that the United States needs to take to remain leaders in global trade. The bipartisan Indo-Pacific Trade Strategy Commission will deliver recommendations to Congress on options that it can take to compete in the region to achieve U.S. objectives and deliver measurable outcomes,"" said Congresswoman Carol Miller.   “Due to inaction by the current administration, we are losing ground in global markets for American producers. Considering the challenges to security in the Indo-Pacific and aggression by China, we cannot allow the United States to miss crucial opportunities to stand up for American workers, benefit consumers, and strengthen relationships with allies. This bill is an important step as Congress works to reassert its constitutional authority over trade matters, and I thank Rep. Miller and my other colleagues who have come together to introduce it,"" said Rep. Adrian Smith.     “It is hard to overstate the tremendous and growing importance of the Indo-Pacific region for the U.S. economy, either as a destination for American exports, a key link in critical supply chains, or as a source of foreign direct investment,” said Rep. Beyer. “It is crucial that the United States is at the table as the rules governing Indo-Pacific trade are being crafted. This legislation will provide us with the information we need and recommendations on how to best engage with our allies and partners to put the U.S. workers in a position to succeed in the years ahead,” said Congressman Beyer.   “The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is pleased to support the United States Trade Leadership in the Indo-Pacific Act. By the end of this decade more than 60% of the world’s middle class consumers will reside in the Indo-Pacific region, and American workers, farmers, and companies need better access to those growing markets. This bill provides a roadmap that will lead the United States back the negotiating table for new market-opening trade agreements to support jobs and growth here at home,” said John Murphy, Senior Vice President and Head of International, U.S. Chamber of Commerce. “The National Foreign Trade Council applauds the introduction today of the U.S. Trade Leadership in the Indo-Pacific Act and congratulates its bipartisan cosponsors. This legislation reflects strong, bipartisan support for consistent, durable, and aggressive U.S. leadership that builds confidence with our allies in the region. Congress has an important role to play in signaling that the United States is committed for the long-term and will work to promote our economic security by deepening economic integration across the Indo-Pacific, creating new commercial opportunities for our companies, farmers, and workers. We hope the actions proposed by this legislation will help to inform policymakers about the risks to U.S. security and economic interests of inaction - or insufficient action - and spark more aggressive leadership that can deliver meaningful results for American businesses and workers.” said Tiffany Smith, Vice President for Global Trade Policy.   “The U.S. must reestablish leadership on the global trade front and NRF applauds Representatives Carol Miller, R-W.V., Ami Bera, D-Ca., Adrian Smith, R-Neb., Don Beyer, D-Va., Darin LaHood, R-Ill., and Jimmy Panetta, D-Calif., for introducing the U.S. Trade Leadership in the Indo-Pacific Act. This important bill will not only help identify the current gaps in our trade policy toward the region, but also find opportunities to re-engage and help U.S. companies, including retailers, compete globally. The retail industry overwhelmingly supports a more comprehensive and economic strategy to ensure further certainty and resiliency in the supply chain,” said David French, Senior Vice President, Government Relations, National Retail Federation.   “Leading retailers welcome today’s introduction of the United States Trade Leadership in the Indo-Pacific Act, which will help chart a path towards meaningful U.S. engagement in the Indo-Pacific region and create vital market access opportunities that American businesses need to create more diversified and resilient supply chains. This bill sends an important signal that the U.S. must engage proactively with trading partners in the region or risk falling behind – disadvantaging American businesses, workers, and consumers. RILA and our members thank Rep. Carol Miller for her leadership on this bill, as well as Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee Chair Adrian Smith and Reps. Darin LaHood, Ami Bera, Don Beyer, and Jimmy Panetta for joining in the introduction of this important legislation that will help American businesses compete globally,” said Blake Harden, Vice President of International Trade.   ""AAFA fully supports re-engaging with our allies in the Indo-Pacific on trade. The U.S. is left out of key markets because we are not negotiating meaningful and comprehensive trade agreements in the region, specifically with Vietnam. Many thanks to Rep. Carol Miller for her leadership in introducing this important measure and ensuring we can advance U.S. trade priorities in the Indo-Pacific region,” said Stephen Lamar, President and CEO of the American Apparel & Footwear Association.   “America's most recognizable food, beverage, household and personal care manufacturers applaud the introduction of the U.S. Trade Leadership in the Indo-Pacific Act and Congressional efforts that will strengthen supply chains and connectivity with key global markets in the region. As the largest domestic manufacturing sector, the CPG industry is bullish on harnessing the potential of Congressionally supported trade efforts to promote U.S. competitiveness, grow the economy and support American manufacturing jobs.” said David Chavern, President and CEO, Consumer Brands Association.    “The US-ASEAN Business Council, which represents 175 American companies doing business in Southeast Asia, with over $7 trillion in combined revenue, welcomes Rep. Miller's legislative leadership in reinvigorating the competitiveness of US trade policy in Asia.  While US trade growth with Southeast Asia is strong, reaching over $500 billion last year and supporting over half a million jobs across the nation, all of America's trade competitors already have — or are negotiating — preferential market access trade agreements for their businesses with Southeast Asia, a region forecasted to be 4th largest economy in the world by 2030, "" Amb.

April 10,Mike Bost,R,Ill.-12,BOST INTRODUCES BILL PROTECTING FARM LAND,"Washington, D.C. – Congressman Darin LaHood (IL-16), a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), voted to support H.R. 7888, the Reforming Intelligence and Securing America Act (RISAA). The bill, which LaHood helped author as the lead on HPSCI's Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) Working Group, is the largest reform of the FBI in a generation and puts an end to FISA abuses while maintaining Section 702's ability to target bad actors overseas and keep Americans safe.   LaHood released the following statement after the vote:   ""We face the greatest terrorist threat since 9/11. The most important tool our Intelligence Community has to keep Americans safe from those threats is Section 702 of FISA, but it must be reformed to protect American civil liberties from abuses.   ""Over the past year, Intelligence Committee Republicans have worked to address the unacceptable Section 702 abuses, like the inappropriate FBI query I believe was committed against me, and the Title I FISA abuses outside of Section 702, like those in the Crossfire Hurricane investigation. The RISAA  incorporates over 50 FISA reforms and marks the largest reform of the FBI in a generation.    ""At a time when Iran, Russia, and the CCP are working every day to undermine our freedom and our interests around the globe, and with a wide open southern border, allowing Section 702 of FISA to expire or be gutted would put our country at grave risk. The RISAA takes the necessary steps to overhaul the FBI, prevent the abuses committed against President Trump's campaign from happening again, protect American civil liberties, and bring needed transparency to the FISA Court, while also allowing our intelligence services to continue to hunt down terrorists and bad actors. I look forward to our continued work on the Intelligence Committee to provide oversight on the Intelligence Community and keep Americans safe.""

April 10,Elise Stefanik,R,N.Y.-21,ICYMI: Defense One: New bill would greatly expand Defense Department quantum efforts,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced the first-ever federal rule limiting PFAS in drinking water, which will protect 100 million people from PFAS exposure. To support states and territories in detection of PFAS and implementation of this new national standard, the Biden-Harris Administration has also announced an additional $1 billion, made possible through President Biden’s Investing in American agenda. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)—also known as “forever chemicals”–are man-made chemicals that cannot be broken down. According to the CDC, 97% of Americans have at least some PFAS in their blood. Exposure to PFAS has been connected to several serious health issues, including cancers, liver and heart disease, and immune and developmental damage to infants and children. “PFAS is a serious environmental and health issue that has harmed communities in Pennsylvania, like mine, for decades—this new national standard is the first of its kind and will help fulfill our right to clean drinking water,” Rep. Dean said. “For too long, victims of PFAS exposure have suffered deadly cancers and other serious health issues. Because of tenacious advocates, who have educated the public and demanded change for decades, we can better protect our neighbors. I thank them for their tireless work toward environmental justice, and I commend the Biden Administration, especially the EPA, for this major step for the health and safety of  communities and for future generations.” The new rule creates a Maximum Contaminant Level, or MCL, that is near zero. Ten states, including the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, have previously set MCLs; the EPA’s nationwide MCL is stricter and enforceable across all 50 states. As a former state Representative for Pennsylvania’s 153rd District and now as the U.S. Representative for Pennsylvania’s Fourth Congressional District, Congresswoman Dean has prioritized limiting PFAS, funding research on the health consequences of PFAS exposure, and holding those responsible for the manufacturing of these forever chemicals accountable. Most recently, she introduced the PFAS Accountability Act to create a federal cause of action and allow courts to award medical monitoring for victims of PFAS exposure.  Rep. Madeleine Dean is a mother, grandmother, attorney, professor, former four-term member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, and U.S. Representative for the Fourth District of Pennsylvania. ### Permalink: https://dean.house.gov/2024/4/congresswoman-dean-celebrates-first-national-standard-to-limit-pfas-pollution-in-drinking-water

April 10,Elise Stefanik,R,N.Y.-21,"Stefanik, Blackburn Introduce the Defense Quantum Acceleration Act","WASHINGTON, D.C. – Congresswoman Madeleine Dean (PA-04) and Congressman Donald Beyer (VA-08) led a letter to urge the Biden Administration to extend Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to Ethiopians. The letter was signed by 44 other Members of Congress. TPS authority stems from the same deeply held principles that underpin the U.S. refugee and asylum systems—that the United States will not return people to situations where their lives or freedom will be threatened. A country is typically designated for TPS when conditions in the country fall into one or more of the three statutory bases for designation: ongoing armed conflict, environmental disasters, or extraordinary and temporary conditions. Since last year, a large-scale conflict has raged in Amhara, Ethiopia’s second largest region, leading the Ethiopian government to declare a state of emergency on August 4, 2023, and renew it on February 2, 2024. According to the International Organization for Migration, more than 3.45 million Ethiopians are internally displaced. And droughts have devastated communities—the UN expects the number of critically food insecure people to rise over the next few months, reaching 10.8 million by this summer.   “The conditions in Ethiopia remain dire; ongoing conflicts continue to pose serious threats to personal safety and drought continues to disrupt living conditions and exacerbate food insecurity and hunger,” the lawmakers wrote. “We call upon the administration to do its part to continue to protect Ethiopians in the United States from deportation by extending and redesignating Ethiopia for TPS.” Protections for Ethiopian TPS holders are set to expire on June 12, 2024. The lawmakers urged President Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to issue an immediate 18-month extension and redesignation. Read the full letter here.

April 11,Elise Stefanik,R,N.Y.-21,ICYMI: National Review: Stefanik Blasts Harvard for Failure to Discipline Students Who Allegedly Assaulted Israeli Classmate,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – This morning, President Biden announced a final rule implementing the background check requirements in the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. The Department of Justice estimates that there are over 20,000 unlicensed sellers who are selling firearms through online advertisements, gun shows, and other means. Under the Biden Administration’s rule, these sellers must become licensed firearm dealers and therefore must run background checks on all sales. In 2022, Congresswoman Madeleine Dean (PA-04) voted along with more than 200 of her House colleagues to pass the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act — the first gun violence prevention legislation in nearly 30 nears. And in December 2023, Congresswoman Dean led 160 of her colleagues in urging President Biden to finalize this rule. The letter can be found here. “When we passed the Safer Communities Act, we had just lost ten people in Buffalo, and 19 students and two teachers in Uvalde, to gun violence. This is a uniquely American problem — a problem that led me to run for public office in the first place,"" said Rep. Dean. ""The Safer Communities Act is a meaningful action that we must build upon. I applaud the President for implementing it as strongly as possible to save lives.” Specifically, the rule: Lists the types of commercial activity indicating that a person must become a licensed dealer and run background checks; States that the gun show or online sale loopholes do not exist; Prevents people from evading the licensing and background check requirements by claiming that they are just selling a few guns; Prevents people from falsely claiming that guns are part of a personal collection to evade the law; and Closes the firesale loophole. More information on the final rule can be found here. Rep. Madeleine Dean is a mother, grandmother, attorney, professor, former four-term member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, and U.S. Representative for the Fourth District of Pennsylvania. ### Permalink: https://dean.house.gov/2024/4/congresswoman-dean-applauds-biden-administration-rule-to-close-gun-sale-loopholes

The announcement comes after Stanton and Grijalva sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne Criswell, urging them to quickly allocate funding under the replenished SSP and ensure border communities were prioritized.  Maricopa County will receive $11,606,329, Pima County will receive $21,827,581, World Hunger in Maricopa will receive $11,606,329, and World Hunger in Yuma will receive $9,532,854.  “This funding couldn’t come soon enough. I’ve visited local aid groups along the border, and they’re near a breaking point—over-stretching their budgets to help care for migrant families and prevent street releases,” Stanton said. “I’ll keep working to make sure Arizona communities get their fair share of federal resources to manage this crisis.”  “I appreciate the Biden administration’s swiftness to allocate this federal funding to Arizona. I will continue to work with federal, state, local, and non-governmental organizations to ensure this funding is distributed expeditiously. As Southern Arizona communities continue to deal with the humanitarian crisis, it’s critical we provide them with the resources and funding they need,” Grijalva said. “It’s clear that the only path forward to address these issues long-term is real immigration reform to fix our broken system beginning with humane solutions, increased legal pathways, dealing with root causes, and providing more resources and personnel at the border instead of Republicans’ detrimental funding cuts and failed enforcement-only policies.”  FEMA also announced several key changes to the program—including two common-sense fixes Stanton urged Biden Administration officials to make in a December letter.

This amendment corrects that mistake,” said Congressman Crenshaw. “Make no mistake, the cartels are a multi-billion dollar business that traffic in fentanyl and other illicit drugs. They are a national security threat, and this amendment will help to dismantle the cartels.”  The amendment was passed in coordination with the Reforming Intelligence and Securing America Act, the largest reform to the Foreign Intelligence and Surveillance Act (FISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) in a generation, while reauthorizing Section 702. The bill includes 56 reforms to prevent abuses and it drastically reduces FBI querying.Background:Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act authorizes the intelligence community to collect the electronic communications of a non-U.S. person, located outside the United States, who possesses foreign intelligence information.

April 12,Elise Stefanik,R,N.Y.-21,"ICYMI: Stefanik Holds Missile Defense Agency Accountable to Use $10M at Fort Drum to Improve Homeland Missile Defense, as Congressionally Directed","WASHINGTON, DC – Today, Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-1) and Joaquin Castro (TX-20) introduced the Enhancing Development Finance Corporation Oversight Act of 2024, bipartisan legislation that would grant law enforcement authority to the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the United States International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) in order to improve oversight and accountability of U.S. foreign aid programs. Six years ago, Reps. Fitzpatrick and Castro helped to establish the DFC as co-sponsors of the 2018 Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development Act (BUILD) Act. To ensure appropriate oversight over taxpayer dollars expended through the DFC, the BUILD Act simultaneously established the DFC OIG with a mission to prevent, detect, and deter waste, fraud, and abuse in DFC programs and operations. Until 2020, when the DFC OIG became operational, the OIG for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) provided oversight for DFC programs. While the USAID OIG has federal law enforcement authorities to conduct criminal investigations, including the authority to make arrests and obtain and execute search warrants, the DFC OIG does not currently possess these same authorities, constraining its oversight power. “The International Development Finance Corporation Office of Inspector General (DFC OIG) must be given law enforcement authority in order to properly provide oversight of its programs,” said Congressman Fitzpatrick. “I am proud to co-lead this bipartisan legislation with Rep. Castro that would improve oversight and accountability of U.S. foreign aid programs by granting the DFC OIG further authority to reduce unnecessary misuse of resources.” “Across the federal government, strong Inspectors General play an essential role in rooting out fraud and maintaining trust in government programs. As U.S. global development projects continue to expand, Congress needs to ensure that DFC’s OIG has the tools to maintain the highest level of integrity in DFC’s operations. This bipartisan bill will help the United States set a strong example of good governance at home and abroad, and I am thankful to Congressman Fitzpatrick for his partnership on this much-needed bipartisan reform,” said Congressman Castro. “I applaud Congressman Joaquin Castro and Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick for re-introducing the Enhancing Development Finance Corporation Oversight Act, which will provide the DFC’s Office of Inspector General with the needed law enforcement authorities to identify and eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse. As a strong proponent of the DFC, I believe it is critical that the agency's IG have the full suite of tools to properly conduct oversight of the agency's operations.  I commend Reps. Castro and Fitzpatrick for their leadership on this important issue, and I urge Congress to enact this legislation,” said former Congressman Ted Yoho, lead author of the BUILD Act. “This bipartisan measure gives the DFC’s Office of Inspector General the same authority other federal OIG’s have to ensure strong oversight and accountability of agency projects,” said Rob Mosbacher, Jr., a member of the Modernizing Foreign Assistance Network member who served as President and CEO of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) from 2005 to 2009. “I commend Congressman Castro and Fitzpatrick for their leadership.” Law enforcement authorities for Inspectors General are generally granted through the Inspector General Act of 1978, which outlines a process by which the U.S. Attorney General can delegate these authorities. The Department of Justice has indicated that it has no objections to providing law enforcement authority to the DFC OIG but has not moved to grant such authority. The Enhancing Development Finance Corporation Oversight Act of 2024 would restore appropriate law enforcement oversight to the DFC and ensure that agency programs continue to operate with integrity and efficiency.

This follows Minnesota House Republicans’ initial letter to Secretary Mayorkas surrounding the alarming report that a member of Al-Shabaab was allowed to roam the country for nearly a year before being arrested in Minnesota. In case you missed it…Known terrorist spent year in US after being wrongly released by feds — and GOP lawmakers demand answersNew York PostJennie TaerApril 2, 2024https://nypost.com/2024/04/02/us-news/lawmakers-demand-to-know-if-taxpayers-funded-al-shabaab-terrorist/  A Somali terrorist was allowed into the country and able to operate freely for almost a year before authorities realized their error and re-arrested him.  Republican lawmakers are now demanding information from Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas about what happened to the man – and whether US citizens funded any part of his journey or stay in the US.  The 27-year-old Somalian – who has so far not been identified by name – was on the watchlist as “a confirmed member of al Shabaab” involved in the use, manufacturing or transportation of explosives or firearms, but a border bungle meant he was released after initially being arrested for crossing into the country illegally in California in March 2023.  A letter from Republican lawmakers seeks to find the al-Shabaab member’s path from illegally crossing the border to Minnesota, were he was eventually re-arrested in January, and if he received any government benefits.  It also seeks to find if he took a commercial flight with US citizens to reach their state and if his travel was funded with taxpayer dollars according to the Tuesday letter, first obtained by The Post.  The letter states: “Due to Minnesota’s far distance from the border, it is not an easy task for migrants to travel to the state…  “Did the al-Shabbab terrorist travel to Minnesota with the assistance, either direct or indirect of an [Non-Governmental Organization]? If so, which NGO was responsible for transporting the individual to Minnesota?”  The terrorist organization member had initially crossed into California and been arrested by Border Patrol. However, the Terrorist Screening Center determined he was a “mismatch” to the terror watchlist leading to his release.  Nearly a year later, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) nabbed him after federal authorities made a “redetermination” and released he was associated with the Somalian militant group, designated a terror organization by the National Counterterrorism Center.  In a February press conference, ICE Acting Director Patrick Lechleitner said his agency arrested the individual “within 48 hours” of learning his true identity.  “The Biden administration’s open-borders agenda allowed a known terrorist to roam freely throughout our state, and now they must answer for their inexcusable negligence,” House Majority Whip Tom Emmer said in a statement to The Post regarding the probe.  Border Patrol has recorded an ever-growing number of migrants listed on the terror watchlist attempting to enter the US illegally in recent years.  Between October 2023 and February, agents have already recorded 70 encounters at both the southern and northern borders, according to federal data.  There were 172 such encounters recorded in fiscal year 2023, which ran from October 2022 to September 2023, 98 in fiscal year 2022, 16 in fiscal year 2021 and 14 between fiscal years 2017 and 2020.  In March, Border Patrol agents apprehended Lebanese national Basel Bassel Ebbadi, 22, who told personnel that he came to the US “to try to make a bomb,” according to internal federal documents first obtained by The Post.  Ebbadi admitted to a border agent he is a member of Hezbollah and was later confirmed as a “positive match” on the terror watchlist.  ###  Permalink: https://emmer.house.gov/2024/4/icymi-emmer-minnesota-house-republicans-demand-answers-on-al-shabaab-terrorist-s-travel-to-minnesota"

April 11,Brian Fitzpatrick,R,Pa.-1,"Fitzpatrick, Castro Launch Bipartisan Push to Protect U.S. Development Finance Programs from Waste, Fraud, and Abuse","For far too long, Washington Democrats and the liberal media have worked hand-in-hand to mislead Americans about the situation on our border. They say that the border is secure and that Biden’s agenda is working. And if you don’t believe them, they call you ignorant – or even worse – racist. We saw a panel on MSNBC mock Virginia Republicans who listed the border as a top priority during coverage of Super Tuesday. More recently, a Democrat in Congress told the audience at a candidate forum to ""forget the border"" and called it a ""Republican talking point and a distraction.""  Washington Democrats and the liberal media are wrong on every level. A recent poll found that Americans believe the border crisis is the most important problem facing our nation. In another recent poll, 73% of respondents said they want the Biden administration to “make it tougher to get in the U.S. illegally.” Interestingly, that includes 56% of Democrats and 78% of independents.  The truth is that the American people know that our border is in absolute chaos. And they are sick and tired of the Left and liberal media trying to protect Biden from being held accountable for creating the worst border crisis in history. Americans know that the reason we’ve had more than 10 million illegal border entries under Biden is because he took a sledgehammer to former President Donald Trump’s effective immigration agenda. Let’s start with Biden’s move to reinstate catch-and-release, one of the most damaging – and dangerous – examples of his border policies. Hospitals, shelters, and schools are getting overwhelmed because they can’t handle the massive influx of illegal immigrants. What’s also alarming is that in many cases, we have no idea who these individuals are. According to a county official in San Diego, a “minimum” of 125,000 illegal immigrants have been released from detention “without proper vetting” onto the city’s streets in just a span of six months. Without sufficient vetting, there is no way to know if the people coming across the border are dangerous criminals or evil terrorists. On Day One of his administration, Biden made the reckless decision to cancel construction of Trump’s border wall. Back in March, we saw a shocking video where illegal immigrants broke through razor wire then overpowered the Texas National Guard at the El Paso border. In addition to ending construction on Trump’s border wall, the Biden administration is doing everything it can to stop Texas Governor Greg Abbott from taking matters into his own hands by putting up his own wall along the border.  In 2022, Biden got rid of Remain in Mexico, one of the most effective border policies put in place by the Trump administration. When I led a group of my Republican colleagues on a fact-finding mission to the southern border a few years ago, border patrol officials told us that Remain in Mexico, which held illegals seeking asylum on the other side of the border versus being released in the U.S., was one of the most important tools in curbing incentives to illegally cross into our nation.  While the Left and liberal media continue to mislead and insult the American people, House Republicans are fighting tooth and nail to advance the policies we need to end this crisis. As your congressman, you can rest assured that I will NEVER stop fighting to make our border secure again."

April 10,Shelley Moore Capito,R,W.Va.,"Capito, Colleagues Introduce the Preserving Emergency Access in Key Sites ActRead More","Washington, D.C. - Congressman Bob Good (VA-05) introduced the Iran China Accountability Act to prevent the Biden Administration from entering into a disastrous nuclear agreement with Iran. The bill blocks any taxpayer dollars from being used to advance a nuclear agreement with Iran until Iran has terminated its cash ties with China and requires Iran to terminate its ties to terrorist groups like Hamas.  ""President Biden has effectively abandoned our most important friend and ally in the Middle East, Israel. From the very early days since Iran-backed Hamas terrorists brutally attacked, Biden has been pressuring Israel to surrender,” said Good. “Meanwhile, Biden has waived sanctions on Iran, releasing billions of dollars to the regime.”  The Iran China Accountability Act condemns Hamas-incited terrorist attacks and mandates a rigorous process for any potential nuclear agreement with Iran. Among its provisions, the bill:  Good continued, “Iran and China both seek America’s downfall. My legislation will hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable and ensure that Biden never re-enters the failed nuclear agreement with Iran.”  Co-sponsors: Rep. Mary Miller (IL- 15), Rep. Andy Ogles (TN-05), Rep. Barry Moore (AL-02), Rep. Clay Higgins (LA-03) Supporting Groups: Endowment for Middle East Truth (EMET), Zionist Organization of America (ZOA)  “The West, and most particularly the United States and Israel, are entering into a particularly perilous historic period with the merger of two of our greatest enemies, the Islamic Republic of Iran and China. Each of these nations harbor profound resentment and antipathy to all of the values our democracies represent, making this legislation critically important. Iran has already been the recipient of billions of dollars of US taxpayers’ funds through the JCPOA and has brutally massacred its own citizens who have courageously fought to overthrow their brutal theocracy. It has also created a network of terrorist proxies throughout the Middle East, as China has been attempting to purchase economic power throughout the region. This important bill must be passed, and any further agreement with Iran must go through the Constitutional protections of ratification of two-thirds of the US Senate.” – Sarah Stern, Founder & President, Endowment for Middle East Truth (EMET)   ""Iran is the root cause of all the problems of the Middle East Region, and making any deal with Iran while they continue to support Islamist terrorist groups including Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis and calling for the destruction of America and Israel is an intolerable obscenity for the foreign policy interests of the United States as well as for our moral integrity. ZOA applauds Rep. Bob Good for his leadership in introducing this House bill that would prohibit the expenditure of any US taxpayer funds to advance a nuclear agreement with Iran while Iran is working with enemies of the U.S., including Arab terrorists responsible for the October 7th atrocities and China, which has played an extremely hostile roll in the entire Middle East region.  ""Any agreement with Iran can only be in effect once it is ratified as a treaty, which is a requirement of the U.S. Constitution. It is a step forward that this legislation requires Iran to end support for horrific terrorist groups, like Hamas. ZOA praises Rep. Good and Senator Blackburn (R-TN) for this important effort."" – Morton A. Klein, National President, Zionist Organization of America (ZOA)"
April 10,Shelley Moore Capito,R,W.Va.,Ranking Member Capito Opening Statement at Hearing on Air Quality MonitoringRead More,"Reps. Crawford and Duarte Introduce Legislation to Protect Water Systems from Cyber Threats 4/11/2024 Washington – Citing persistent cyber threats to our nation’s critical water infrastructure, Congressmen Rick Crawford (AR-01) and John Duarte (CA-13) introduced H.R. 7922, the Water Risk and Resilience Organization (WRRO) Establishment Act. This legislation establishes a new governing body, the WRRO, with cyber and water-system expertise to develop and enforce cybersecurity requirements for drinking and wastewater systems. The WRRO will work in partnership with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to ensure cybersecurity measures are both practical and beneficial. “Foreign adversaries such as Russia and China have utilized cyber-attacks to target critical infrastructure such as water systems. This bill is a more proactive approach to safeguarding our drinking and wastewater from these types of attacks. These protections are vital at a time where cyber threats are constant and technology is evolving quickly,” Rep. Crawford said. Earlier this year, FBI Director, Christopher Wray testified to Congress that Chinese hackers have been targeting infrastructure such as water treatment plants, electrical grids, and pipelines. Just last month, other administration officials echoed this sentiment when both the national security advisor and EPA sent letters to state governors. In the letters, they urge the governors to address any vulnerabilities in their state’s water systems to minimize risks of cyber-attacks.  This is more than just a threat; cybersecurity breaches have already happened around the country. Just before last Thanksgiving, a small Pennsylvania water utility was breached by pro-Iran hackers. A Florida water treatment facility was hacked in 2021, and the hackers tried to increase the amount of beneficial chemicals in the water to unsafe levels. In February, the U.S. intelligence community reported that Chinese-backed hackers have had a presence in many critical infrastructure systems in the U.S., including water systems for as long as maybe five years. “With the constant threat of cyberattacks by our adversaries, the United States’ water infrastructure must be secured and defended properly,” said Rep. Duarte. “I am proud to help lead this crucial legislation with Rep. Crawford to ensure that our wastewater and drinking water systems are adequately prepared to deal with potential cybersecurity threats.” Leaders in the water system industry have shown wide support for the Water Risk and Resilience Organization Establishment Act. They recognize the importance of safeguarding this critical resource and are willing to play a role in achieving this goal. “Strong and effective cybersecurity oversight is critical for the water sector,” said American Water Works Association CEO David LaFrance. “Rep. Crawford’s vision for a collaborative model that leverages the knowledge of the sector is the right approach for protecting water utilities from cyber-attacks.”  “NAWC applauds the leadership of Rep. Crawford to advance legislation that helps bolster cybersecurity protections for the entire water sector. This legislation is long overdue and aligns with our guiding cybersecurity pillars, which call for greater collaboration and coordination of efforts to better protect critical water infrastructure,” said Rob Powelson, President and CEO of the National Association of Water Companies. “Cyber threats targeting both informational and operational systems today pose a growing threat to the nation’s water systems, and a successful cyber-attack could threaten public health while also undermining the public’s confidence in their water supply. AMWA supports H.R. 7922 as a critical piece of the puzzle to defend the nation’s water systems from criminals and bad actors in cyberspace, and we thank Rep. Crawford for his leadership on this important bill,” said Tom Dobbins, CEO of the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies.  Cyber-attacks often cost millions of dollars to address and can result in contamination, malfunctions, and service outages. Leveraging private sector expertise to provide cybersecurity awareness to thousands of public water systems across America is critical to ensuring infrastructure security.

April 10,Shelley Moore Capito,R,W.Va.,"In Case You Missed It: VIDEO: Capito Talks TikTok, Data Privacy on CNBCRead More","WASHINGTON, DC – Today, U.S. Representatives Andy Barr (R-KY), Ami Bera, M.D. (D-CA), Mario Díaz-Balart (R-FL), and Gerald E. Connolly (D-VA), Co-Chairs of the Congressional Taiwan Caucus, introduced a bipartisan resolution reaffirming the United States’ commitment to Taiwan and commemorating the 45th anniversary of the enactment of the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA). The resolution is cosponsored by a bipartisan group of 63 Members of Congress. Enacted on April 10, 1979, the TRA is an historic piece of legislation that embodies the United States’ commitment to make defense articles available for Taiwan’s self-defense capability and to maintain the capacity of the United States to resist any threat endangering the security of the people of Taiwan. Over the past four decades, the TRA has underpinned the robust United States-Taiwan relationship. Today, the enduring bond between the people of the United States and Taiwan serves as a beacon of democratic values, human rights, and the rule of law in the Indo-Pacific and across the world. ""For the past 45 years, the Taiwan Relations Act has been a cornerstone of peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region, embodying the strong and unwavering commitment of the United States to Taiwan,” said Congressman Andy Barr. “The United States is proud to have a deep and dynamic partnership with Taiwan, one that is based on mutual respect, shared democratic values, and a common commitment to freedom.” “The Taiwan Relations Act serves as the cornerstone of the U.S.-Taiwan relationship, fostering decades of fruitful economic, security, and trade ties,” said Congressman Ami Bera. “Taiwan’s engagement in international organizations to address shared challenges in public health, climate change, and democratic resilience exemplify its capabilities to be a force for good in the Indo-Pacific and across the globe. The United States remains steadfast in support of the people of Taiwan and our shared commitment to democratic values and the rule of law.” “I’m proud to co-sponsor this resolution commemorating the anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act which serves as the cornerstone of the U.S.-Taiwan relationship. The United States and Taiwan share core values in democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. Taiwan stands as a key ally, crucial to prosperity and stability in the region. The United States remains steadfast in its support of the people of Taiwan, and will continue to fortify this valued partnership for years to come,” said Congressman Mario Díaz-Balart. “Now more than ever, it is imperative that the United States stands shoulder to shoulder with Taiwan to celebrate our shared democratic values,” said Congressman Gerald E. Connolly. ?“What better way to reaffirm that solidarity than by recognizing the lasting importance of the Taiwan Relations Act, the foundation of our relationship. Today, we honor the friendship between the US and Taiwan and we recommit ourselves to preserving and protecting the critical partnership we share.” U.S. Senators  Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Jeff Merkley (D-OR) introduced a companion resolution in the U.S. Senate.

This marks the third consecutive month of inflation increases, demonstrating that the Biden Administration's claim that Bidenomics is effective in ""tamping down"" inflation is unequivocally false. As a result, Kentuckians will continue to feel the impact of higher prices at the gas pump, in grocery stores, and when trying to achieve the goal of homeownership.  ""As a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee and Chairman of the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Monetary Policy, it is my responsibility to monitor the ongoing inflation crisis, to ensure that the Federal Reserve is working independently to achieve its price stability mandate, and to seek solutions to counteract our national debt,"" said Congressman Barr. ""The Biden Administration's reckless spending and failed policies continue to jeopardize the futures of hardworking Americans, with the average household paying an astonishing $16,368 more a year for the same goods and services than they were on the day Joe Biden took office. The Democrats war against our capital markets and the energy sector are driving up the cost of everything. It is past time to return fiscal sanity to Washington.""

The legislation was introduced last week alongside Representative Morgan Luttrell (R-TX) and now awaits a full floor vote in the House of Representatives. The bipartisan piece of legislation would enhance border security operations by requiring the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to present a plan to Congress for integrating innovative technologies, like artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and nanotechnology, at the border. “Border security means keeping drug and human traffickers away from our communities—and we can do that by ensuring those working on our nation’s frontlines have access to the best and most-advanced technology available,” Correa said. “This legislation is common-sense, and will allow Congress to better-understand how our officers can stop smugglers, as well as identify and respond when migrants are crossing in remote and deadly conditions. It’s why it received bipartisan support, and why it was passed out of the Homeland Security Committee today. I’m confident that my colleagues across the aisle and across Congress will come together to get this legislation passed through the full House as soon as possible.” The legislation was introduced after DHS’ announcement of its “Artificial Intelligence Roadmap” last month. The roadmap details DHS’s 2024 plans, including to test uses of the technologies that deliver meaningful benefits to the American public and advance homeland security, while ensuring that individuals’ privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties are protected.

April 12,Chris Van Hollen,D,Md.,Maryland Delegation Announces First $3.5 Million Installment of Federal Funds to Support Port of Baltimore Workers Impacted by Francis Scott Key Bridge Collapse,"WASHINGTON — Today, Representative Lou Correa (CA-46) announced Matthew Bersalona, a resident of Anaheim, Calif. and student at Oxford Academy, as the winner of the 2023 Congressional App Challenge in California’s 46th District. As one of the challenge winners, Matthew was invited to demonstrate his app to Members of Congress and their staff in the U.S. Capitol.   Rep. Correa presents Matthew Bersalona with a Congressional Recognition for his winning of the Congressional App Challenge “Matthew created his app, Recollect, as a way to help tackle the mental health crisis by his peers and millions across this country head-on. It was designed to let users meditate, track tasks, and journal every day to ease the burden of stressors and incentivize putting mental health first,” Correa said. “It’s no surprise that Matthew was the winner of my Congressional App Challenge this past year. He’s an incredibly bright mind who meets every challenge he faces with poise and purpose—and embodies the next generation of STEM leadership, homegrown right here in Orange County.”  You can watch a walkthrough of his app, Recollect, HERE and by clicking the image below.   Screenshot of Matthew’s development and demonstration of his app, Recollect When asked what inspired the creation of Recollect, Bersalona said: “A few months ago, I reached one of the lowest points of my life, feeling depressed and hopeless because of the fact that I was doing nothing good with my life. Even though I knew that I had important things to do at that time, I completely neglected them because I was consumed by my video game addiction. That was up until I saw a YouTube video [that made] me realize that I was feeling horrible about myself because I was treating myself horribly. With this realization, I became more organized with my life, which led to me being more productive and feeling better about myself. The shocking fact about high school students, especially those at my school, is that many of them can relate to having poor mental health at some point.” The Congressional App Challenge is an official initiative of the U.S. House of Representatives, where Members of Congress host contests in their districts for middle school and high school students, encouraging them to learn to code and inspiring them to pursue careers in computer science. Each participating Member of Congress selects a winning app from their district, and each winning team is invited to showcase their winning app to Congress during our annual #HouseOfCode festival. The program is a public-private partnership made possible through funding from Omidyar Network, AWS, Rise, theCoderSchool, Apple, and others. The wildly successful competition continues to impress upon House Members the importance of computer science education and the need to develop a pipeline of diverse, domestic STEM talent. “Mental health is a silent epidemic that plagues teens for a majority of their lives, which is why I tried to tackle it with Recollect,” Bersalona concluded. “By creating a healthy mental space for the user, their mental health should improve over time. Even if it is not a solution for everyone, I hope this app can be used to better their lifestyles. ###

April 11,Lisa Murkowski,R,Alaska,Alaska Congressional Delegation selects Julie Kitka to lead Denali Commission,"WASHINGTON - At a House Financial Services Committee hearing today, U.S. Representative Juan Vargas (CA-52), co-chair of the Congressional Sustainable Investment Caucus, voiced strong support for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) recently finalized climate disclosure rule. “Climate change is happening no matter what people think. I'm from San Diego, and you don't think of floods… and we just had a gigantic flood in San Diego, a 1,000-year event. And it flooded a good portion of San Diego, we had all these problems, something we normally don't get,” said Rep. Vargas. “This stuff is real. Investors know it, companies know it, the information is there, they should disclose it. And that's what this rule attempts to do.” Last year, Reps. Vargas and Sean Casten (IL-06) founded the Congressional Sustainable Investment Caucus to create a forum to protect Americans’ freedom to invest while increasing the information available to market participants about the risks posed by climate change. Rep. Vargas’s Corporate Governance Improvement and Investor Protection Act, which passed the House in the 117th Congress, encouraged corporations to address important issues such as climate change and worker rights by requiring the SEC to create standard definitions for environmental and social responsibility metrics. The bill also included language from Rep. Casten’s Climate Risk Disclosure Act that required public companies to disclose additional information about their exposure to climate-related risks.  A rough transcript of an excerpt from Rep. Vargas’s remarks and questions for witness Professor Jill E. Fisch, University of Pennsylvania Law School Saul A. Fox Distinguished Professor of Business Law, is available below.  Rep. Vargas:  In your view, how was the rule consistent with the SEC’s three-part mission to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation? Professor Fisch:  Thank you. So as my written testimony details, this is information that investors have been demanding, this is a small tip of the information that investors have been demanding with respect to business risks, sustainability challenges for companies, and it responds to the long-standing information asymmetry. Companies have this information, investors don't.  And that information asymmetry, reducing that information asymmetry, is what produces more efficient markets so that investors can choose the companies in which they want to invest, so they can evaluate whether a business plan is resilient for the future, and so they can evaluate the quality of management.  And something we haven't really focused on today is investors do that not just by buying and selling securities, they also do that through exercising their governance rights. And part of the SEC's mandate is to provide meaningful disclosure so that investors can vote, so that they can vote to elect directors who are monitoring material risks, so that they can vote for or against shareholder proposals based on how well they think the company is doing. And how does that facilitate capital formation? Well, obviously, if you've got strong quality markets, that's going to make it easier for companies to raise capital. And that's going to tailor the costs of capital to a company's business plan. And we see that in the fact that so many companies come to the U.S. capital markets to raise capital. Rep. Vargas:  Now, I do want to say this, you talked about the corporations, a lot of these corporations do in fact, collect this information, as you said, because they think it's real… The reality is that they do compile this information because it’s important.  And climate change is happening no matter what people think. I mean, I'm from San Diego, and you don't think of floods and San Diego, we just had a gigantic flood in San Diego, a 1,000-year event. And it flooded a good portion of San Diego, and we had all these problems, something we normally don't get. Now you can't buy insurance in large parts of California, because of climate change.  This stuff is real. Investors know it, companies know it, the information is there, they should disclose it. And that's what this rule attempts to do.  ###"

(Apr. 12, 2024) — Congresswoman Cori Bush (MO-01) released the below statement following the House passage of H.R. 7888, the Reforming Intelligence and Securing America Act. This bill reauthorizes Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) despite failing to impose a warrant requirement when the government wants to spy on U.S. citizens, and despite its inclusion of amendments dramatically expanding unnecessary surveillance of immigrants and the types of businesses that the government could compel to turn over electronic communications. “Our government has a long and dark history of illegally surveilling U.S. citizens. Black and brown communities, as well as anti-war and other social movements, have borne the brunt of this injustice, enduring disproportionate targeting—from COINTELPRO to the protests ignited by the murder of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, and now, the protests against Cop City in Atlanta. I voted no to reauthorize FISA Section 702 because I refuse to sanction this shameful expansion of unrestricted, warrantless government surveillance. I will continue to be a relentless champion for safety and privacy for all people in St. Louis and across our country.” ###"

April 11,J. Luis Correa,D,Calif.-46,CORREA STATEMENT ON REPORTS OF NEW NOTIFICATION FORMS UNDER HART-SCOTT-RODINO ACT,"Washington, D.C. – Today, Rep. Mike Levin (CA-49) sent a letter to House Energy and Commerce (E&C) Energy, Climate, and Grid Security Subcommittee Chairman Jeff Duncan (SC-03) and Ranking Member Diana DeGette (CO-01) regarding the Subcommittee’s hearing today on spent nuclear fuel. The letter details potential solutions for the approximately 90,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel stranded at nuclear power plants across the country, harming host communities and costing taxpayers billions of dollars. The letter goes on to highlight the shortcomings of the current system for storing spent nuclear fuel, including the impact it has on the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station in Rep. Levin’s district. Accordingly, the letter shares Rep. Levin’s perspective on the necessity of a consent-based approach to break the stalemate over storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel. Critically, the letter explains specific consent-based actions that Congress and the federal government must take to address our current spent nuclear fuel challenges. The Subcommittee invited Daniel Stetson, the Chairman of the San Onofre Community Engagement Panel, to share his expertise through testimony at the hearing. “It is clear to me, and I hope to you as well, that Congress must act.” writes Rep. Levin. “We have seen how a lack of consent has historically stopped projects – both public and private…. While it is encouraging that for the first time in more than a decade the government is finally progressing towards fulfilling its obligation to take title to this waste, we still have a long way to go towards a comprehensive, integrated waste management system.” Click here or read the full letter below: Dear Chairman Duncan and Ranking Member DeGette, As the Energy, Climate, and Grid Security Subcommittee conducts its hearing titled “American Nuclear Energy Expansion: Spent Fuel Policy and Innovation,” I write on behalf of my constituents in California’s 49th Congressional District to share our perspectives on spent nuclear fuel issues. I first wish to express my appreciation for the Subcommittee’s attention to such a long-standing issue that impacts Congressional districts across the country, including the one that I represent and call home. I am also grateful for the Subcommittee’s invitation to Daniel Stetson, the Chairman of the San Onofre Community Engagement Panel, to share more about the impact that the current system of spent fuel management has on our community. Since the 1950s, approximately 90,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel have been generated from commercial nuclear power generation in the United States, and this inventory grows by approximately 2,000 metric tons every single year. In 1982, Congress passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, which mandated that the U.S. government take possession of spent nuclear fuel and assigned the Department of Energy (DOE) the responsibility to manage spent nuclear fuel from commercial reactors. Then in 1987, Congress decided to designate Yucca Mountain as the sole candidate for a permanent geologic repository, without engaging in a consent-based process, and over Nevadans’ objections. More recent private storage efforts in New Mexico and Texas have not advanced due to a similar lack of consent. As a result, the 90,000 metric tons of existing spent nuclear fuel is being stored indefinitely at over 70 sites in more than 30 states, without the consent of the communities in which they are located. To say that this current situation is not ideal would be an understatement. Because the federal government was unable to fulfill its responsibility to begin disposing of spent nuclear fuel beginning in January 1998, the federal government has been found to be in partial breach of its contract with owners of commercial nuclear power reactors and must use taxpayer dollars to pay for damages of this breach. The latest Nuclear Waste Fund Audit Report by the DOE Inspector General (DOE-OIG-24-02) notes that this partial breach has cost taxpayers $10.6 billion through September 30, 2023, and that the remaining additional liabilities will total $34.1 billion. These funds add to the federal deficit without benefit of budget or appropriations considerations. This breach also leaves communities like my own to serve as de facto interim storage sites, without their consent. The decommissioning San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS) in my district currently stores more than 3.5 million pounds of spent nuclear fuel just 100 feet from the Pacific Ocean, near active fault lines, surrounded by highly populated areas and on Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton. Since I took office in 2019, one of my top priorities has been moving the spent nuclear fuel from SONGS as quickly and safely as possible. Part of this work has included working with colleagues to secure funding for DOE to restart a federal, consent-based consolidated interim storage program. In April 2023, DOE released its comprehensive outline for a 10- to 15-year plan to successfully site and store spent fuel using a consent-based siting process. This process is designed to work with local governments that want to host a site in a way that is inclusive, community-driven, phased, and adaptive. We have seen how a lack of consent has historically stopped projects – both public and private – so I am optimistic that this new, consent-based approach can break the current stalemate on the development of federal management capacity for spent nuclear fuel. While it is encouraging that for the first time in more than a decade the government is finally progressing towards fulfilling its obligation to take title to this waste, we still have a long way to go towards a comprehensive, integrated waste management system. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has found that “a variety of actions are needed to move ahead, including authorization of a new effort to determine where a disposal facility should be located and the development of a management strategy,” and that “Congress needs to take action to break the impasse over a permanent solution for commercial spent nuclear fuel.” While we do not yet know the ultimate sites for consolidated interim storage and a permanent repository, we do know the consent-based path that we must take to successfully site these facilities. We also have the benefit of years of thought and expert development of a bipartisan path forward for how we successfully manage our nuclear future. And, we can now look to the examples set by other countries, such as Finland, Sweden, and Canada, and how their work prioritized consent and was led by single purpose organizations. It is clear to me, and I hope to you as well, that Congress must act. Particularly at a time when we are considering promoting further nuclear energy development, we must also consider the technology’s full life span, including its long-term impact and environmental risks. Anything short of addressing the spent fuel problem is irresponsible and could result in a future, preventable crisis. In the immediate term, we must continue to provide funding, on a bipartisan basis, to DOE’s integrated waste management work, and ensure that annual funding is commensurate with the Department’s needs throughout the process. We must also provide DOE with clear direction to develop a total system plan for the management of spent nuclear fuel, and to build capacity and execute upon this plan. We must also amend existing law to grant the federal government the authority to site, construct and operate a consolidated interim storage site and ultimately a new geological repository, and direct that these processes be based in consent, as agreed upon by the host communities themselves. We must also work with potential host communities and states to identify benefits they can receive in exchange for their volunteering to store this waste. Further, we ought to ensure that we make progress on siting a repository in tandem with a consolidated interim storage facility, so as to provide interim storage host communities with the assurance that they will not become permanent storage sites by default. We may even consider creating a new single-purpose, autonomous organization insulated from the political process and with access to reliable and adequate funding, to handle these tasks. Communities across the country, including my own, have waited patiently for action on this matter. It is past time that we end the continued stalemate that is wasteful of taxpayer resources. The path ahead will not be easy and will require many difficult conversations. But I am committed to seeing this through, and I hope to work with you and your staff to finally fulfill the federal government’s responsibility to manage spent nuclear fuel. Sincerely, Mike Levin United States Representative ###"
April 12,J. Luis Correa,D,Calif.-46,CORREA STATEMENT ON REAUTHORIZATION OF FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE ACT,"Washington, D.C. — Today, the Co-Chairs of the House Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition (SEEC) Clean Energy Deployment Task Force, Reps. Mike Levin (CA-49) and Sean Casten (IL-06), released the following statement in response to the finalization of the Renewable Energy Rule from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), which will spur the responsible development of clean energy on America’s public lands.  “Today, the Biden-Harris Administration announced a historic milestone in ensuring we are maximizing the ability of our public lands to fight the climate crisis,” said Reps. Levin and Casten. “We are pleased to see that we have already surpassed the goal of permitting 25 GW of renewable energy on our public lands by 2025. Now we must build on this progress and continue to aim higher. That’s why our bill, the Clean Electricity and Transmission Acceleration (CETA) Act, sets the next goal of permitting 60 GW by 2030, while also further promoting the buildout of renewable energy on public lands in a responsible, equitable, and efficient manner. “Responsible and planned development of renewables on public lands provides certainty to developers, setting the stage for successful projects while ensuring our most treasured resources are protected. We applaud the now operational projects in California, which prove this planned approach works. But we know more permitting reforms are needed to allow for more efficient development in priority areas without sacrificing environmental protections. We must also ensure that state and local communities benefit from projects in their jurisdiction. Today’s announcement strengthens our resolve to get the necessary reforms in our bill enacted into law.” Background Reps. Levin and Casten introduced the Clean Electricity and Transmission Acceleration (CETA) Act in December 2023 to serve as a consensus House Democrat vision to address the primary permitting and transmission issues holding back the American clean energy transition. The bill is endorsed by the House Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition, the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and the New Democrat Coalition. Reps. Levin and Casten co-lead the bill with 79 of their House Democratic colleagues as cosponsors. Of particular relevance to BLM’s final rule, Title IV of CETA incorporates Rep. Levin’s Public Land Renewable Energy Deployment Act (H.R. 178). This title directs the Department of Interior to permit at least 60 gigawatts of renewable energy on public lands by 2030 and responsibly incentivizes this development on priority areas, while minimizing the adverse impacts to communities and the environment. This title also directs revenues to state and local governments-- providing parity with oil and gas development-- and to fund conservation and mitigation efforts. BLM’s announcement implements authorities that Rep. Levin has championed through the Public Land Renewable Energy Development Act and helped secure in the Energy Act of 2020. A full background on CETA can be found here. ##"
April 12,J. Luis Correa,D,Calif.-46,CORREA ANNOUNCES ANAHEIM RESIDENT AS CONGRESSIONAL APP CHALLENGE WINNER,"Washington, D.C.- Rep. Mike Levin (D-Calif) joined House Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member Raúl M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.), Water, Wildlife, and Fisheries Subcommittee Ranking Member Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.), and Rep. Susie Lee (D-Nev.) to issue the following statements applauding the Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM) final rule for onshore oil and gas leasing on public lands. The rule reflects long overdue fiscal reforms that were passed in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), including increased onshore royalty rates, minimum bid amounts, and rental rates; a new fee to nominate public lands for leasing; and an end to noncompetitive leasing. The rule also strengthens bonding requirements for the first time since 1960. “I applaud the Biden Administration for issuing this final rule to promote conservation and ensure a fair financial return on the profits fossil fuel companies make off our public lands,” said Rep. Levin. “The rule ends giveaways of our public lands to fossil fuel companies, holds companies accountable for cleanup costs, and updates outdated fiscal terms for onshore oil and gas leases, all while protecting our important environmental and cultural resources. Taxpayers should never foot the bill for cleaning up after Big Oil. I’m proud to see provisions of legislation I introduced included in this rule to elevate the interests of the American people over fossil fuel companies’ profits.” “When Big Oil uses our public lands, it stands to reason that they should be giving American taxpayers a fair return for the privilege,” said Ranking Member Grijalva. “That’s why Democrats worked so hard to pass reforms in the Inflation Reduction Act to return some balance to a leasing system that has favored polluters for far too long. The Biden administration is taking an important step in moving those reforms forward with this new rule. The ultimate goal is phasing out fossil fuels for good, but these new taxpayer protections will help make sure the American people aren’t getting ripped off in the meantime.” “Democrats fought long and hard to pass reforms in the Inflation Reduction Act to stop Big Oil from abusing our public lands at the cost of our communities and our climate, and this finalized rule by the Biden-Harris administration is going to ensure those reforms are implemented,” said Rep. Huffman. “This is a huge step in putting people over polluters instead of letting fossil fuel and mining industries pad their pockets and plunder our public lands with impunity.”    “For over a century, Big Oil has paid pennies on the acre to drill on our public lands—and then left taxpayers on the hook to clean up the mess,” said Rep. Katie Porter. “In Congress, I’ve fought to get rid of Big Oil’s sweetheart deal to pollute our public lands. I’m proud my proposals to end this reckless disregard for the environment—and our taxpayer dollars—are now law, and I applaud the Biden Administration for putting these much-needed reforms into action.”  “I represent working families in southern Nevada – not Big Oil & Gas. Public lands belong in public hands, not tied up in costly and unproductive fossil fuel speculation,” said Rep. Susie Lee. “Over 80 percent of Nevada lands are public lands, and I’ve made it a top priority to protect our resources and taxpayers from the outdated and wasteful approach of our speculative leasing system. Today’s announcement is another major step toward fixing the broken elements of this system, in line with my End Speculative Oil and Gas Leasing Act. I will continue to work toward a diverse, clean, and efficient energy economy that unleashes our state’s energy potential while lowering costs and protecting our public lands.”  Background The rule reflects legislation championed by Natural Resources Committee Democrats, including the following: 117th Congress: 118th Congress: ###"
April 10,Juan Vargas,D,Calif.-52,Rep. Vargas Remarks at House Financial Services Committee Hearing on SEC Climate Disclosure Rule,"Washington, D.C. – Today, Rep. Mike Levin (CA-49) announced that he and fellow Members of San Diego’s Congressional delegation secured over $39 million in Shelter and Services Program (SSP) funding for non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and partners in the greater San Diego region that support migrant communities seeking shelter, food, and other critical resources. San Diego County and the Catholic Diocese of San Diego County each received $19,592,554 in SSP funding to assist with migrant arrivals. “All migrants deserve to be treated humanely, and San Diego is striving to be the model for communities receiving migrants across the country. I’m proud that my colleagues and I in the San Diego delegation secured this critical funding, which will help ensure migrants are welcomed with dignity and respect,” said Rep. Levin. “This funding will help our local partners provide additional resources to meet migrants’ basic human needs and reduce the impact on the existing safety net, including on homeless shelters. While I welcome this announcement, I also know we have more work to do. Congress must pass the bipartisan border security agreement, which would in part provide additional SSP funds.” “People who seek asylum and refuge in the U.S. should be treated with respect and dignity. This funding will allow San Diego nonprofits to continue to provide desperately needed humanitarian aid to individuals and families as they await an immigration court hearing or transportation to another part of the country. I thank the Biden administration and urge Congress to pass the bipartisan border security agreement, which would provide an additional $1.4 billion in SSP funds, speed up the judicial process, and give resources to Customs and Border Protection to better manage the border,” said Rep. Scott Peters (CA-50). “The Shelter and Services Program (SSP) is one of our best tools to ensure that our country is living up to our values and treating migrants and asylum seekers with dignity and respect. That’s why I’m so proud that our San Diego congressional delegation secured another $640 million in federal funds for this program, guaranteeing millions of dollars for San Diego. As always, we will keep pushing for comprehensive immigration reform to address the root causes of migration, relieve the strain on our asylum processing system, and expand the legal pathways for people to stay and work in the U.S., but this funding will go a long way to addressing our immediate concerns regarding the housing, safety, and needs of migrants and asylum seekers in San Diego,” said Rep. Sara Jacobs (CA-51). “The San Diego area has a long tradition of welcoming individuals seeking asylum and refuge with open arms. I’m proud to have worked alongside my San Diego delegation colleagues to secure this critical funding for communities and organizations aiding migrants,” said Rep. Juan Vargas (CA-52). “This funding will help make sure they have the resources they need to continue their important work to provide migrant communities with food, shelter, and other critical services.” In February, Rep. Levin led a letter signed by fellow Members of San Diego’s Congressional delegation to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas urging DHS to release available funding for SSP under Fiscal Year 2024 (FY24) Continuing Resolutions (CR). ###"
April 12,Juan Vargas,D,Calif.-52,Representante Vargas y Delegación de San Diego Aseguran $39 Millones en Fondos del Programa de Refugio y Servicios para San Diego,"WASHINGTON – Today, Congressman Joaquin Castro (TX-20), the co-chair of the U.S.-Japan Caucus, and Congressman Henry Cuellar (TX-28), a longtime member of the Caucus, welcomed Bexar County Judge Peter Sakai and his wife, Mrs. Rachel Sakai, to Washington D.C. as their guests for Japanese Prime Minister Kishida’s address to a joint meeting of Congress. The congressmen both represent the city of San Antonio, Texas, which has maintained a sister city relationship with Kumamoto, Japan for nearly four decades.  “Prime Minister Kishida’s visit to Washington has been a wonderful opportunity to reaffirm the benefits of the U.S.-Japan alliance for both nations,” said Congressman Castro. “Judge Sakai's family was among the first Japanese Americans to settle in the Rio Grande Valley, and he has been a trailblazer for Asian American representation in Bexar County. His story is an example of the American Dream, and it was a privilege to host him and his wife Rachel as Prime Minister Kishida delivered an important message about the ties of history and friendship between the United States and Japan.” “Congressman Castro and I were honored to invite Bexar County Judge Peter Sakai and his wife, Rachel Sakai, to join us for Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio's joint address to Congress. Judge Sakai, a second-generation Japanese American, is a strong advocate for Bexar County and South Texas,” said Congressman Cuellar. “I am also proud to be a member of the U.S.-Japan Caucus and believe in continued robust cooperation between our two nations. Japan is a trusted trade partner with the Lone Star State, and I look forward to strengthening this relationship and growing Texas’s trade economy.” ""I want to thank Congressman Joaquin Castro and Congressman Henry Cuellar for inviting Rachel and I to this very special event and look forward to working with them in the future as Bexar County continues to increase its global reach,” said Judge Peter Sakai. “Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's remarks reaffirmed the strong alliance between the United States and Japan. It is critical for the two nations to work together for a global economy and security. Japan is a tremendous trade partner and integral to economic development in both Texas and Bexar County. The alliance the Prime Minister and Vice President Kamala Harris referenced in their remarks supports my vision to advance economic development in Bexar County.” Japan is the second-largest source of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) job creation in Texas and one of the top import partners for the Lone Star State. To further expand U.S.-Japan collaboration at the federal level, Congressman Castro established the bipartisan U.S.-Japan Caucus in 2014 to facilitate cooperation on issues of common interest between the United States and Japan. To learn more about the U.S.-Japan Caucus, click here. Judge Peter Sakai became the first Asian American executive of Bexar County, Texas in January 2023. A second-generation Japanese American, Sakai is the grandson of farmers who left Japan to build new lives in the United States. His maternal grandparents immigrated to South Texas, where they became one of the earliest Japanese families in the Rio Grande Valley. His father’s family immigrated to join the farming community in the Imperial Valley in California. Judge Sakai’s father, Pete, was a high school student in California during the outbreak of World War II and became a victim of the Japanese internment. Growing up, Judge Sakai’s passion for justice and public service was shaped by the stories of his father’s internment and the injustices committed against Japanese Americans during World War II. Mrs. Rachel Sakai was an educator, counselor, and administrator at Harlandale Independent School District for 32 years and retired after serving as the Director of the Gateway to College at Palo Alto College and working as a teacher/sponsor at Providence Catholic School. Now, she dedicates her time to family and her work on numerous boards, nonprofits, and charities. Together, Judge and Mrs. Sakai have two kids, George and Elizabeth, and are blessed to have two wonderful grandchildren, Jackson and Grayson."
April 12,Juan Vargas,D,Calif.-52,"Rep. Vargas, San Diego Delegation Secure Over $39 Million in Shelter and Services Program Funding for San Diego","WASHINGTON – Today, Congressman Joaquin Castro (TX-20), a senior member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Congressman Mike Gallagher (WI-08), the chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, and Senator Tammy Baldwin (WI) introduced the Open Translation Center Act, a bipartisan, bicameral bill to establish a federally funded research center that will be charged with creating publicly-accessible translations of open-source materials (including speeches from government officials, official proclamations, and other documents) from China, Russia, and other nations of strategic interest to the United States. The center would also be responsible for training and developing exceptional analysts and linguists with designated specialties. “The United States can’t afford to be in a position where our competitors know more about us than we know about them,” said Congressman Castro. “For generations, Congress supported open-source translation programs that helped Americans understand both our allies and our adversaries. As our investment in those programs have declined, countries like China and Russia have accelerated their own – putting us at a strategic disadvantage. The Open Translation Center will be an invaluable resource for American journalists, academics, and policymakers and will promote a 21st-century understanding of the global challenges and opportunities that we face.” “Our adversaries, namely the Chinese Communist Party, continue to grow increasingly aggressive across the world-stage. This poses a serious threat to American national security and in order to understand and combat these threats, it is imperative to be able to read and understand our adversaries’ primary sources,” said Congressman Gallagher. “Establishing an Open Translation and Analysis Center is an important, bipartisan step we can take in Congress to better understand and better defend the free world.” “To better understand threats from countries like China and Russia, compete on the world stage, and keep our families safe, we need accurate, up-to-date information about our competitors and adversaries. And that starts with reading, translating, and understanding exactly what they are writing and saying,” said Senator Baldwin. “I am proud to join with my Republican and Democratic colleagues on this effort to increase transparency, strengthen our national security, and keep families and our economy safe.”   As specified in the legislation introduced today, the mission and purpose of the Open Translation Center would be as follows: To execute this mission, the OTC would: For the full bill text, click here."
April 11,Jake Auchincloss,D,Mass.-4,"RELEASE: REP. AUCHINCLOSS ANNOUNCES GUEST FOR JOINT MEETING OF CONGRESS WITH PRIME MINISTER OF JAPAN, KISHIDA FUMIO","Devex: New bill aims to give DFC watchdog law enforcement power WASHINGTON – Today, Reps. Joaquin Castro (TX-20) and Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-01) introduced the Enhancing Development Finance Corporation Oversight Act of 2024, bipartisan legislation that would grant law enforcement authority to the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the United States International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) in order to improve oversight and accountability of U.S. foreign aid programs. Six years ago, Reps. Castro and Fitzpatrick helped to establish the DFC as co-sponsors of the 2018 Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development Act (BUILD) Act. To ensure appropriate oversight over taxpayer dollars expended through the DFC, the BUILD Act simultaneously established the DFC OIG with a mission to prevent, detect, and deter waste, fraud, and abuse in DFC programs and operations. Until 2020, when the DFC OIG became operational, the OIG for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) provided oversight for DFC programs. While the USAID OIG has federal law enforcement authorities to conduct criminal investigations – including the authority to make arrests and obtain and execute search warrants - the DFC OIG does not currently possess these same authorities, constraining its oversight power. “Across the federal government, strong Inspectors General play an essential role in rooting out fraud and maintaining trust in government programs. As U.S. global development projects continue to expand, Congress needs to ensure that DFC’s OIG has the tools to maintain the highest level of integrity in DFC’s operations. This bipartisan bill will help the United States set a strong example of good governance at home and abroad, and I am thankful to Congressman Fitzpatrick for his partnership on this much-needed bipartisan reform,” said Congressman Castro. “The International Development Finance Corporation Office of Inspector General (DFC OIG) must be given law enforcement authority in order to properly provide oversight of its programs,” said Congressman Fitzpatrick. “I am proud to co-lead this bipartisan legislation with Rep. Castro that would improve oversight and accountability of U.S. foreign aid programs by granting the DFC OIG further authority to reduce unnecessary misuse of resources.” ""I applaud Congressman Joaquin Castro and Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick for re-introducing the Enhancing Development Finance Corporation Oversight Act, which will provide the DFC’s Office of Inspector General with the needed law enforcement authorities to identify and eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse.  As a strong proponent of the DFC, I believe it is critical that the agency's IG have the full suite of tools to properly conduct oversight of the agency's operations.  I commend Reps. Castro and Fitzpatrick for their leadership on this important issue, and I urge Congress to enact this legislation,"" said former Congressman Ted Yoho, lead author of the BUILD Act. “This bipartisan measure gives the DFC’s Office of Inspector General the same authority other federal OIG’s have to ensure strong oversight and accountability of agency projects,” said Rob Mosbacher, Jr., a member of the Modernizing Foreign Assistance Network who served as President and CEO of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) from 2005 to 2009. “I commend Congressman Castro and Fitzpatrick for their leadership.” Law enforcement authorities for Inspectors General are generally granted through the Inspector General Act of 1978, which outlines a process by which the U.S. Attorney General can delegate these authorities. The Department of Justice has indicated that it has no objections to providing law enforcement authority to the DFC OIG but has not moved to grant such authority. The Enhancing Development Finance Corporation Oversight Act of 2024 would restore appropriate law enforcement oversight to the DFC and ensure that agency programs continue to operate with integrity and efficiency. The bill text for the Enhancing Development Finance Corporation Oversight Act can be found here."
April 12,Cori Bush,D,Mo.-1,Congresswoman Bush Announces Applications Open for Fiscal Year 2025 Community Project Funding,"Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Representative Jared Huffman (CA-02), Ranking Member of the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Water, Wildlife, and Fisheries, released the following statement regarding the Pacific Fishery Management Council’s vote to cancel salmon fishing season off the California: “Last year’s California’s salmon season closure was a crushing blow for our state. And now we’re facing the unprecedented back-to-back closures of the entire California salmon fishery.  This is a new low – it’s not just devastating, it’s unacceptable,” said Rep. Huffman. “We just finished getting federal approval for last year’s California salmon disaster. I was relieved that with the reforms I’ve passed in Congress and all the political pressure we worked to build, the federal approval process was somewhat faster.  But the amount of disaster money is not nearly enough for the needs of fishermen, tribes, businesses, and families who depend on healthy salmon fisheries – and now we have to start all over again for second consecutive disaster year. “We must do better. On disaster relief, the state must speed up the process for quantifying impacts and the federal government must approve disaster funds faster and at higher levels. But we must also acknowledge that this scramble for federal fishery disaster funds is not the solution to the terrible downward spiral for California salmon fisheries. The solution is to prevent fishery disasters.  That requires confronting wrongheaded policies that are killing salmon – failing to protect cold water supplies, starving rivers and tributaries of flows salmon need to survive, and over-pumping in the Delta during sensitive times for migrating salmon,” Huffman concluded.  In February of this year, Rep. Huffman secured $20 million in relief funds through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for California’s fishing community. This followed continued pressure from the congressman to secure this relief for the 2023 Sacramento River Fall Chinook and Klamath River Fall Chinook and inland salmon fisheries disasters. In April 2023, Huffman, Padilla, and Panetta led their colleagues in an urgent letter to President Joe Biden and Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, calling for them to swiftly declare a federal fishery disaster. Earlier that month, Rep. Huffman held a press conference with Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, Representative Kevin Mullin, and fishing industry stakeholders to call attention to this disaster and highlight the people who will bear the brunt of the impacts of closing the salmon season. In addition to regular follow up with NOAA, Rep. Huffman held a call directly with NOAA Administrator Dr. Rick Spinrad to continue the pressure and encourage him to prompt action. As part of his long-standing efforts to improve disaster relief for fisheries, Congressman Huffman was able to help secure an additional $300 million for fishery disaster declarations Fiscal Year 2023 Omnibus Appropriations bill. Congress also authorized new bipartisan fishery disaster relief language based on Congressman Jared Huffman and Senator Roger Wicker’s Fishery Resource Disasters Improvement Act. This language streamlines the process for declaring a federal fishery disaster and helps to quickly provide relief to affected communities. It also extends eligibility for federal fishery disaster funds not only to commercial fisheries, but also to charter fishing businesses and impacted tribes."
April 12,Cori Bush,D,Mo.-1,Congresswoman Bush Statement on House Vote to Reauthorize Warrantless Government Surveillance,"Water, Wildlife, and Fisheries Subcommittee Ranking Member Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member Raúl M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.),  Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.), Rep. Susie Lee (D-Nev.), and Mike Levin (D-Calif.) today issued the following statements applauding the Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM) final rule for onshore oil and gas leasing on public lands. The rule reflects long overdue fiscal reforms that were passed in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), including increased onshore royalty rates, minimum bid amounts, and rental rates; a new fee to nominate public lands for leasing; and an end to noncompetitive leasing. The rule also strengthens bonding requirements for the first time since 1960. “Democrats fought long and hard to pass reforms in the Inflation Reduction Act to stop Big Oil from abusing our public lands at the cost of our communities and our climate, and this finalized rule by the Biden-Harris administration is going to ensure those reforms are implemented,” said Rep. Huffman. “This is a huge step in putting people over polluters instead of letting fossil fuel and mining industries pad their pockets and plunder our public lands with impunity.”    “When Big Oil uses our public lands, it stands to reason that they should be giving American taxpayers a fair return for the privilege,” said Ranking Member Grijalva. “That’s why Democrats worked so hard to pass reforms in the Inflation Reduction Act to return some balance to a leasing system that has favored polluters for far too long. The Biden administration is taking an important step in moving those reforms forward with this new rule. The ultimate goal is phasing out fossil fuels for good, but these new taxpayer protections will help make sure the American people aren’t getting ripped off in the meantime.” “For over a century, Big Oil has paid pennies on the acre to drill on our public lands—and then left taxpayers on the hook to clean up the mess,” said Rep. Katie Porter. “In Congress, I’ve fought to get rid of Big Oil’s sweetheart deal to pollute our public lands. I’m proud my proposals to end this reckless disregard for the environment—and our taxpayer dollars—are now law, and I applaud the Biden Administration for putting these much-needed reforms into action.”  “I represent working families in southern Nevada – not Big Oil & Gas. Public lands belong in public hands, not tied up in costly and unproductive fossil fuel speculation,” said Rep. Susie Lee. “Over 80 percent of Nevada lands are public lands, and I’ve made it a top priority to protect our resources and taxpayers from the outdated and wasteful approach of our speculative leasing system. Today’s announcement is another major step toward fixing the broken elements of this system, in line with my End Speculative Oil and Gas Leasing Act. I will continue to work toward a diverse, clean, and efficient energy economy that unleashes our state’s energy potential while lowering costs and protecting our public lands.”  “I applaud the Biden Administration for issuing this final rule to promote conservation and ensure a fair financial return on the profits fossil fuel companies make off our public lands,” said Rep. Levin. “The rule ends giveaways of our public lands to fossil fuel companies, holds companies accountable for cleanup costs, and updates outdated fiscal terms for onshore oil and gas leases, all while protecting our important environmental and cultural resources. Taxpayers should never foot the bill for cleaning up after Big Oil. I’m proud to see provisions of legislation I introduced included in this rule to elevate the interests of the American people over fossil fuel companies’ profits.” Background The rule reflects legislation championed by Natural Resources Committee Democrats, including the following: 117th Congress: 118th Congress:"

April 10,Sherrod Brown,D,Ohio,Brown Pushes to Protect Ohioans from Increase in Cost of High-Speed Internet,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, Congressman Carlos A. Gimenez (FL-28) and Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (FL-25) co-lead a bill to enhance coral restoration efforts in South Florida. The Conserving Our Reefs Along Lower (CORAL) Florida Act would create a new $5 million grant program to states, local municipalities, non-profits, and non-governmental organizations including the Mote Marine Laboratory in the Florida Keys, to carry out coral restoration efforts.  “South Florida’s coral reefs are crucial to our vibrant coastline, support our rich and diverse marine life and aquatic ecosystem, and attract millions of tourists to our great state,” said Rep. Gimenez. “Proud to work on this bipartisan effort to ensure Florida’s reef managers, scientists, and conservation organizations have the resources they need to carry out their critical mission of saving our reefs.” “Florida’s coral reefs support diverse marine life, protect our coastlines from flooding, and help attract millions of visitors and billions of dollars in economic impact to our state,” said Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz. “Ensuring the health of our beautiful coral reefs is not a partisan issue, it’s a Florida issue, and one with global health implications. I’m proud to be a part of this bipartisan effort to restore South Florida’s aquatic ecosystems.” Permalink: https://gimenez.house.gov/2024/4/rep-carlos-gimenez-introduces-bill-to-enhance-coral-restoration-efforts

April 11,Sherrod Brown,D,Ohio,Brown Pushes Administration to Investigate Unfair Chinese Trade Practices in Shipbuilding,"This week, Bidenflation numbers came in hotter than expected, according to the March 2024 Consumer Price Index (CPI) data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The destructive policies of ‘Bidenomics’ have caused consumer prices to rise for three straight months, with March showing that inflation increased by 3.5%, the highest level in six months.

Following the CPI report, Rep. Jack Bergman released the following statement:

“The Biden Administration has been determined to undermine our economic and national security from day one and Michiganders are paying the price. Whether it’s at the pump, the grocery store, or the housing market – affordability of basic necessities is down, and inflation is up. I will continue working to eliminate improper payments from our federal government and to reign in the out-of-control spending that is stealing the taxpayers’ money, purchasing power, and overall freedom.”

Inflation in Michigan by the Numbers ·    Using CPI March data, it’s estimated that the average household in Michigan is paying $948 more per month to purchase the same goods and services as in January 2021. ·    Overall, the average Michigan household has spent $22,638 more due to inflation since January 2021, which includes: o  $146 more on food per month  o  $184 more on shelter per month  o  $109 more on energy per month o  $290 more on transportation per month Inflation in the United States by the Numbers ·    Since January 2021, prices have increased by 18.9% o  This means that the average family of four is paying an additional $16,726 per year or $1,393 per month to purchase the same goods and services as in January 2021. ·    Overall inflation is up 19.4% since Joe Biden took office ·    Americans are paying more for just about everything because of inflation since Biden took office:   o  Electricity is UP 29.2%. o  Rent of primary residence is UP 17.2%. o  Food prices are UP 21.1%. o  Eggs are up 49.3% o  Baby food is UP 30.5% o  Sugar and sugar substitutes are up 29% o  Frozen vegetables are up 28.2% o  Cookies are up 26.7% o  Soups  are up 26.4% o  Uncooked beef steaks are up 24.8% o  Poultry is up 24.4% o  Pet food is up 23.7% o  Snacks are up 22.7% o  Coffee is up 19.6% ·    Real average weekly wages are down 3.9% since Biden took office. ·    As of April 11, 2024 the gross national debt is more than $34 trillion. This equates to:  o  $103,839 per person in the U.S. o  $263,314 per household in the U.S.

April 10,Rick Scott,R,Fla.,"Senators Rick Scott, Ted Budd & Joni Ernst Introduce Bill to Consider Terminating Qatar’s Major Non-NATO Ally Status","Today, U.S. Representatives  Gerald E. Connolly (D-VA), Ami Bera, M.D. (D-CA), Mario Díaz-Balart (R-FL), and Andy Barr (R-KY), Co-Chairs of the Congressional Taiwan Caucus, introduced a bipartisan resolution reaffirming the United States’ commitment to Taiwan and commemorating the 45th anniversary of the enactment of the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA). The resolution is cosponsored by a bipartisan group of 63 Members of Congress. Enacted on April 10, 1979, the TRA is an historic piece of legislation that embodies the United States’ commitment to make defense articles available for Taiwan’s self-defense capability and to maintain the capacity of the United States to resist any threat endangering the security of the people of Taiwan. Over the past four decades, the TRA has underpinned the robust United States-Taiwan relationship. Today, the enduring bond between the people of United States and Taiwan serves as a beacon of democratic values, human rights, and the rule of law in the Indo-Pacific and across the world.

“Now more than ever, it is imperative that the United States stands shoulder to shoulder with Taiwan to celebrate our shared democratic values,” said Congressman Gerald E. Connolly. “What better way to reaffirm that solidarity than by recognizing the lasting importance of the Taiwan Relations Act, the foundation of our relationship. Today, we honor the friendship between the US and Taiwan and we recommit ourselves to preserving and protecting the critical partnership we share. ” “The Taiwan Relations Act serves as the cornerstone of the U.S.-Taiwan relationship, fostering decades of fruitful economic, security, and trade ties,” said Congressman Ami Bera, who also serves as Ranking Member of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Indo-Pacific. “Taiwan’s engagement in international organizations to address shared challenges in public health, climate change, and democratic resilience exemplify its capabilities to be a force for good in the Indo-Pacific and across the globe. The United States remains steadfast in support of the people of Taiwan and our shared commitment to democratic values and the rule of law.” “I’m proud to co-sponsor this resolution commemorating the anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act which serves as the cornerstone of the U.S.-Taiwan relationship. The United States and Taiwan share core values in democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. Taiwan stands as a key ally, crucial to prosperity and stability in the region. The United States remains steadfast in its support of the people of Taiwan, and will continue to fortify this valued partnership for years to come,” said Congressman Mario Díaz-Balart.  ""For the past 45 years, the Taiwan Relations Act has been a cornerstone of peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region, embodying the strong and unwavering commitment of the United States to Taiwan,” said Congressman Andy Barr. “The United States is proud to have a deep and dynamic partnership with Taiwan, one that is based on mutual respect, shared democratic values, and a common commitment to freedom.” U.S. Senators Jeff Merkley (D-OR) and Marco Rubio (R-FL) introduced a companion resolution in the U.S. Senate.

April 11,Rick Scott,R,Fla.,Sen. Rick Scott: Bidenomics is Hammering Florida Small Businesses,"Congressman Gerry Connolly (D-VA), the Ranking Member of the House Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Government Innovation, released the following statement in support of the Biden Administration’s finalized rule designed to expand and improve opportunities for early career talent in the federal government:

“The federal government is facing a retirement tsunami, and yet we still have a long way to go toward ensuring we can recruit and retain the workforce of tomorrow. That’s why I introduced the Building the Next Generation of Federal Employees Act, and it’s why I am thrilled that the Biden Administration is taking action today to significantly expand and improve the most prominent internship program in the federal government. Pathways had more than 60,000 paid interns in 2010. By 2020, participation had tanked to just 4,000. That is an unsustainable decline, and yet it doesn’t even convey the full scale of the desperate recruitment situation the federal government finds itself in today. 70% of private sector interns are ultimately hired by the company they interned with. The same cannot be said of federal interns, who have a much tougher path to employment with the federal government after their internships are completed. This is a problem that will only get worse without the significant intervention this rule provides. Today’s finalized rule brings us one step closer to embracing modern day recruiting and hiring strategies that will allow us to effectively build out the next generation of civil servants.”

Connolly is the author of the Building the Next Generation of Federal Employees (NextGenFeds) Act, legislation to help the federal government leverage internships to attract a qualified and diverse pool of candidates to the federal workforce and to create a pathway for interns to transition to full-time employment in public service. Connolly outlined the importance of the legislation in a 2022 OpEd for CNN. Sign up to get news and updates from Rep. Gerry Connolly directly to your inbox."

I applaud Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s clear-eyed address to Congress that emphasized our shared responsibility to uphold our shared values in the face of rising aggression in the Indo-Pacific and across the globe.  I commend Japan for its increasing leadership as a regional and global steward on critical issues like Russia, China, nuclear non-proliferation, and more.

April 11,Rick Scott,R,Fla.,Senate Republicans Demand Schumer Hold Mayorkas Impeachment Trial,"New Resolution Coincides with the Annual Day of (No) Silence WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Reps. Mark Takano (CA-39), Barbara Lee (CA-12), and Senator Brian Schatz (D-HI) introduced a resolution to support the Rise Up for LGBTQI+ Youth in Schools Initiative. This resolution was cosponsored by Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) and coincides with the Annual Day of (No) Silence. “As a former teacher, I know that school shouldn’t be about just surviving — it should be about thriving,” said Rep. Mark Takano, Co-Chair of the Congressional Equality Caucus. “LGBTQ students across the country who are being targeted by this wave of culture war politics are being denied safety in the educational institutions that are supposed to support them. We need to protect LGBTQ student’s right to thrive, to find joy in learning, to discover their passions, and to embark on the rest of their lives in educational settings that support and affirm them. We have to do better and those in power must demand it.” “With the rise of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation in the last year, it is clear that queer youth need our help. GOP extremists are using the lives of this vulnerable population as political tools at the expense of their mental health and well-being,” said Rep. Barbara Lee, Vice-Chair of the Congressional Equality Caucus. I am proud to stand with Congressman Takano and Senator Schatz to re-introduce the Rise Up for LGBTQI+ Youth in School Initiative. For the sake of our children’s lives, it is imperative for my colleagues to support this resolution to ensure their safety and success in school.” “Every child should feel safe at school,” said Senator Schatz. “As attacks against LGBTQ+ students increase across the country, we need to take action to protect these students and fight back against the discriminatory policies that harm them. Our resolution pledges support to LGBTQ+ students, and makes clear this discrimination will not be tolerated in the Congress.” “Also, GLSEN provided this as well for folks: ""This year has already been marked by tragic reminders of the persistent bullying and harassment faced by LGBTQI+ students, especially as extremists at every level of government continue to pursue discriminatory policies that exclude youth from equitable access to educational opportunity,” said GLSEN Executive Director Melanie Willingham-Jaggers. “We must reject the politics of hate and division. Today, individuals across the country - including students, educators, activists, and allies - are coming together for GLSEN's annual Day of (No) Silence to fight back against bullying and harassment in schools. I applaud Senator Schatz, Representative Takano, and Representative Lee for their sustained leadership in rising up for LGBTQI+ youth by leading this resolution and showing up with full faith in the boundless potential of the next generation.” Text to the resolution can be found here. ###"
