       "'FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE |\\xa0Contact: Olivia Porcaro 202-225-6165 Over the past few months, we have watched violent, antisemitic, un-American, and pro-terrorist mobs take over college campuses across the country, endangering Jewish students and other innocent bystanders. Yet, for months, many Democrats have refused to speak out against the protests.  Sadly, this is no surprise. Antisemitism is a disease that the Far-Left, along with liberal university leaders, has allowed to spread.  In fact, over the past year, we have watched Democrats spread anti-Israel rhetoric time and time again. Some have called for Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to be replaced, one said it was an “honor” to visit with the pro-Hamas protestors at Columbia University, one defended the phrase “from the river to the sea”, which implies the destruction of Israel, one denounced Israel as a “racist state,” and more.  In addition, Far-Left Democrats in the House of Representatives have repeatedly voted against legislation supporting Israel. Back in October, immediately following Hamas’ barbaric October 7th attack on Israel, nine Democrats voted against a resolution to stand with Israel as it defended itself from the terrorist group. Then, again, just a few weeks ago, thirteen Democrats voted against condemning Iran’s missile attack on Israel.  The recent actions of the Democrats with respect to Israel are both outrageous and inappropriate. They truly seem to have lost all sense of moral and political clarity and have made it very clear - the Far-Left has a serious anti-Israel problem.  I couldn’t disagree with their views of Israel more.  Israel is our closest friend and ally in the Middle East, and the only democracy in the region. They are under assault by Iran, the largest state sponsor of terrorism and a deadly enemy to both Israel and the United States, and Hamas, a terrorist group who not only ruthlessly murdered over 1,200 Israelis on October 7, 2023, but also still holds over one hundred hostages, including five Americans.  These attacks on Israel are defining moments. Yet, instead of leading through strength and proving to the rest of the world that the United States remains steadfast in our commitment to Israel’s security, many Democrats have publicly criticized our democratic ally. This is both unthinkable and unprecedented, as their actions are driving a rift between the United States and its closest ally, playing into the objectives of the terrorists.   Although I have no faith that they will, I am calling on all of them, as well as the morally bankrupt university leaders who are allowing pro-terrorist protests on their campuses, to stand with our great ally, Israel, at this critical moment.   As the Leader of the Free World, we must support our allies, work together, and lead through with strength. To do anything else is a public betrayal to our friends in Israel and effectively supports an enemy to civilized people around the world. E-mail Me'"

       "'May 8, 2024 Lawmakers Continue Calls for Extending TPS for Haiti, Halting Deportations, Disrupting Arms Trafficking, Providing Humanitarian & Economic Assistance, and More Press Conference (Twitter) | Photos (Dropbox) WASHINGTON\\xa0– Haiti Caucus Co-Chairs Congresswomen Ayanna Pressley (MA-07), Yvette D. Clarke (NY-09) and Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick (FL-20), along with Congresswoman Cori Bush (MO-01), Congresswoman Frederica Wilson (FL-24), and Congresswoman Barbara Lee (CA-13), held a Capitol Hill press conference with colleagues and advocates to renew their calls for urgent federal action to address the growing crisis in Haiti. The press conference comes at a time when the humanitarian, political, economic, and security crises in Haiti are becoming increasingly dire.\\xa0 The policies called for by the lawmakers and advocates include: extending and redesignating TPS for Haiti; halting all deportations to Haiti; disrupting arms trafficking to the island; providing urgent humanitarian relief; preventing the transfer of Haitian nationals to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; passing a new economic assistance package that creates jobs and rebuilds Haiti’s infrastructure; facilitating the establishment of a representative transitional government led by Haitian civil society; and more. “Our Haitian siblings on the island and throughout the diaspora should know that we have not forgotten them and we will never stop fighting for the just and equitable future the Haitian people need and deserve,” said Congresswoman Pressley, Co-Chair of the House Haiti Caucus. “Congress and the Biden Administration have a moral obligation to take action to stabilize Haiti and to save lives, including by providing humanitarian and economic assistance, extending TPS for Haiti, halting deportations, supporting a democratic transition led by Haitian civil society, and more. If we truly believe Black lives matter, then that must include Haitian lives.” “Our nation owes a debt to Haiti. Repayment begins by helping ensure that a Haitian-led democracy rings true in their communities, in the United States, and across the globe. We must take every action necessary to secure a democratic transition led by Haiti’s civil society, and that includes providing vital humanitarian and economic aid, expediting visa processing, cracking down on illegal arms trafficking, and extending TPS and halting deportations. Congress has a responsibility to support Haitian stability and the safety of all its people, and it holds the power to deliver the progress our Haitian neighbors at home and abroad are counting on. In this dire moment where the future of our beloved Caribbean ally is at risk and millions of lives remain imperiled, inaction is inexcusable,” said Congresswoman Yvette D. Clarke, Co-Chair of the House Haiti Caucus. “In the face of the crisis in Haiti, our moral compass and international duty compel us to step forward, not just to alleviate the immediate suffering of the Haitian people, but to address the systemic problems forcing Haitians to flee their homeland. The extension and re-designation of Temporary Protected Status (TPS), alongside an expedited parole program and an immediate halt to deportations, are critical first steps. But our responsibility does not end there. We must confront the root causes of migration by: (1) ensuring that Haitians can live safely and peacefully within their own borders; (2) taking a firm stand against the trafficking of firearms from places like Florida to Haiti; (3) holding those who perpetuate violence and instability accountable,” said Congresswoman Sheila Cherfilus McCormick, Co-Chair of the House Haiti Caucus. “As a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I have a pulse on the challenges facing our allies around the world. Just as we have extended our support to them during their time of need, Haiti deserves the same treatment. The time for action is now – to protect lives, foster security, and promote stability where Haitians can thrive in their own country.” “To deport people back to Haiti is a cause and kiss of death,” said Congresswoman Frederica Wilson. “There is nothing in Haiti but suffering, so we have to say to the President of the United States, ‘Stop the deportation.’ Not only expand TPS but stop the deportation and support the new government that we are putting together in Haiti. This government is being supported by the international community, the United States government, and the Caribbean community; it is Haitian-led. We must fund them—fund them just as we do other countries. Fund them! Fund them just like you fund other countries.” The lawmakers were joined by Guerline Jozef, Executive Director of Haitian Bridge Alliance, Patrice Lawrence,\\xa0Executive Director of UndocuBlack\\xa0Network, Mary Estimé-Irvin, Chairwoman of National Haitian American Elected Officials Network, Tessa Petit, Executive Director of Florida Immigrant Coalition, and impacted families and TPS recipients. “It’s urgent for President Biden to re-designate and extend TPS for Haiti,” said Guerline Jozef, Co-Founder and Executive Director, Haitian Bridge Alliance. “Equally vital is for the United States Congress to pass an economic package supporting job creation and key infrastructure projects. Additionally, the Biden administration must immediately cease the deportation of Haitian nationals. Sending people to a country plagued by insecurity and humanitarian crises is\\xa0 unconscionable. The disparate treatment of Black immigrants must come to an end!” “UndocuBlack Network calls on the Biden- Harris administration to end the cruelty against Haitians. It is cruel to deport Haitian nationals while arranging for evacuation of American nationals at the same time. Our ask is simple, honor the dignity of Haitian people. If Secretary Mayorkas leads by these values, he will release Haitians from detention, extend and redesignate TPS for Haiti and stop the deportations now. To be the change President Biden claimed to be, he must act differently from his predecessors especially as it relates to Black immigrants,” said Patrice Lawrence, Executive Director, UndocuBlack Network. “The painful reality of the Haitian people is complex and multi-layered.\\xa0 However, the immediate steps that need to be taken can happen with the stroke of a pen. It is time for the Administration to redesignate and extend TPS for Haiti. It is also crucial that all deportation of Haitians be immediately halted,” said Tessa Petit, Executive Director, Florida Immigrant Coalition. “Haitians need security, justice, understanding and acceptance.\\xa0 That will only be possible with the will from the administration to support Haiti by addressing its root causes, through a comprehensive humanitarian and economic support that will change the future of the Haitian people.” “An economic plan akin to the Marshall Plan is essential to aid Haiti, which is located less than 90 miles from our shores, in addition to humanitarian assistance and the reconsideration of TPS,” said Mary Estimé-Irvin, Chairwoman, National Haitian American Elected Officials Network. “Like Israel, Ukraine, and Taiwan, Haiti is a sovereign nation that requires support.” Footage from the press conference can be found here, and photos can be found here. As Representative for the Massachusetts 7th\\xa0Congressional District, Congresswoman Pressley serves as Co-Chair for the House Haiti Caucus and represents one of the largest Haitian diaspora communities in the country, with approximately 46,000 Haitians and Haitian-Americans living across the state and over half in the Boston metropolitan area. Additionally, Massachusetts is home to more than 4,700 Haitians with Temporary Protected Status. ### Washington DC Office 402 Cannon HOB\\r\\nWashington, DC 20515 Phone (202) 225-5111\\r\\nFax (202) 225-9322 District Office 1295 River Street\\r\\nHyde Park, MA 02136 Phone (617) 850-0040\\r\\nFax (202) 225-9322'"
